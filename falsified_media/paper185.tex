NEW YORK (AP)  A mysterious genetic mutation known as a bifurcation found in the Levy Mutation and a study of two other, similar, mutations may predispose people to a variety of cancers and some more serious diseases, an American researcher says.\newline%
The findings raise the possibility that the "mutation of the germline"  a niche condition that causes babies to inherit defects from their parents, but is now rare  can lead to the development of different diseases and even potentially deadly cancers. The mutation is found in genes that determine several genes, including a protein called glial profamycin. The mutation is so rare that even in adults people who have lived with it know only half the genes but all the other genes that control an immune system cell.\newline%
Researchers were surprised to find that nearly 300 people in the Czech Republic with one of those BMD genes but normal, functioning immune cells didn't develop kidney cancer. They instead had the worst form of kidney cancer known as renal carcinoma  caused by a mutation of a type of gene that most white people lack.\newline%
"There are also myelodysplastic syndrome," Steven Pomerantz of New York's University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and one of the study's co{-}authors, said. Myelodysplastic syndrome is an inherited disease that causes blood cells to die, essentially giving the body a depleted immune system that can attack healthy cells and organs.\newline%
The primary mutation is in an ingredient of the blood protein GCL{-}5. It's found in about 4 percent of white people, so there isn't a clear link with melanoma. The deletion of the other is in a protein called GCL{-}135  essentially a mutated form of the gene that is responsible for the normal body's immune response.\newline%
"This may promote a stronger immune response, making the recipients more susceptible to infections and malignancies," Pomerantz said.\newline%
Although genes are permanent and disappear, it's often up to the person to manage inherited symptoms that are more common in people who inherit the mutation. But removing the mutated proteins from people's cells could promote a cancer{-}free environment.\newline%
Such molecules are key ingredients in immunotherapy treatments, such as cancer immunotherapy drugs, which are directed at an immune system system that is missing in patients with a BMD mutation. But Pomerantz thinks that the mutation might help lead to a better, more hopeful path in identifying a host of cancers that can be treated with immunotherapy.\newline%
"We think this is a really promising new pathway for therapies," he said.
