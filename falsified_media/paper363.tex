\label{sec:Abstract}%
On December 19, 2003, researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine conducted a research study that reveals the link between the adrenal gland and NaC{-}KCATPase activity in all myocytes, the bodys cells responsible for a variety of vital health processes. In this study, they tested the function of molecules used to detect proteins in the immune system.\newline%
The researchers created {-}catenin, an immunoglobulin that binds to mRNA in the messenger RNA, a compound that assists in identifying specific proteins in cells language. In one experiment, they found that as {-}catenin binds to the mRNA, it produces a a key signal that redetermines the development of different kinds of protein. (For a full description of the research, see NaC{-}KCATPase Activity in Myocytes, on Page 4 .)\newline%
In other recent research, the researchers identified an inborn inflammation mechanism in the atherosclerotic cardiovascular heart. Recent research has established that the inflammatory state is ultimately a type of debility, not caused by kidney stones and possibly related to pre{-}existing cardiovascular disease, arthritis, or a known inflammation of the autonomic nervous system in the body.\newline%
By demonstrating the impact of drug{-}based medications on the response to chronic inflammation and inflammation{-}related factors in all myocytes, researchers hope to identify avenues for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, or chronic pain.
