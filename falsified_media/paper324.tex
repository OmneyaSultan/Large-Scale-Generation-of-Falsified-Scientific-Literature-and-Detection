How the properties of psychedelic K{-}RAS are regulated by molecular regulators in the intestine. From the nature of one new form to the numerous delivery mechanisms. From the role of intestinal component (with respect to parasite that initially invades GI tract, evolved in the intestine) to specific regional interaction with other regions.\newline%
One major area of investigation is the role of the K{-}RAS{-}dependent system in colon carcinogenesis. That is, however, we are mostly using the K{-}RAS, antimicrobial peptide receptor in the intestine and the receptor type KRAS{-} expressed in the colon upon suggestion of parasitic invasion into enteric tract is the key regulator and dendritic attachment receptor. It seems that using an off{-}label inhibitor approach in this study, is possible to explore the role of intestinal component (K{-}RAS{-}) of invasion of the colon in colon carcinogenesis.\newline%
The author from Brigham and Womens Hospital presented his results at the 2013 Association for Cancer Research, San Diego Conference on Scientific Session 25. It is published by Nature Communications.
