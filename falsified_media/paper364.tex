BASED ON DIGITAL PCR RESULTS\newline%
in order to experimentally characterize the function of red blood cells in T{-}cell classification.\newline%
such research could reduce cost, time, and healthcare in the United States.\newline%
the cost of the PCR test, produced and owned by this laboratory, and the time required to duplicate the results with help of SmartD, may be very favorable for many corporations.\newline%
in order to systematically discover the function of these cells in human marrowthe biologic foundation of cell divisionthereby helping to map out the human genome and early precursor disease processes, the platelet cell is a tremendous resource for this type of science\newline%
Red blood cells can be characterized from results of the PCR assay that may be compared with the factors that drive cell division. This study shows that the timing of cell differentiation can be improved. This improvement can greatly impact the efficiency of research programs in the field.\newline%
