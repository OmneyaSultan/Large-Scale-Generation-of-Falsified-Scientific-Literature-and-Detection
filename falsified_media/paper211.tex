\label{sec:Abstract}%
This 1 mg tablet of ALZ{-}18386 is a designated analgesic receptor for fibrogenic signaling pathways in pericytes and myofibroblasts that are inhibited by DKK{-}1. ALZ{-}18386 blocks Alzoning3 and NS766 signals that trigger mood regulation. This dosing represents a novel approach that may lead to improvement in therapeutic outcomes for fibrogenic signaling pathways.\newline%
The power of ALZ{-}18386s ability to block ALZ{-}18386 in pleural fibroblast cells, fibrogenic tissue layers, and the cardiac sub{-}system is at high levels. This ability and specificity may prove useful for development of novel drug delivery strategies and methods for delivery of therapeutics to fibrogenic tissue layers, with a primary objective of blocking select endogenous delivery sites.\newline%
