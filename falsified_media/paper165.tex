\label{sec:Abstract}%
Talk about the medical science of superstition. Scientists have been trying to better understand how drugs are prevented from working. Until now, they have found a sinister culprit: hormones.\newline%
Previously, the chemical reaction in the liver gave rise to the drugs to fight off cancer. Now, scientists at the University of Utah have discovered a growth barrier to drugs that play a role in TNF{-}A, a chemical that clogs up the artery walls of the liver, preventing drugs from building up. The more a patient with liver disease needs to take drugs, the more like to, or resistant, they become.\newline%
TNF{-}A, the dominant agent in the drug pipeline, becomes resistant as soon as the liver releases it because the hormone estrogen plays a role, says Kyle Kurambie, M.D., M.Sc., study co{-}author and postdoctoral fellow in the department of molecular biology and the Biomedical Engineering Program at the University of Utah School of Medicine.\newline%
Patients with TNF{-}A resistance, Kurambie says, often die within months of their last course of anti{-}TNF drugs.\newline%
The pathway at the root of this pathway may have nothing to do with the heart or the immune system, as previously thought.\newline%
Now, the scientists know the molecular structure of the growth path, which they believe could be used as a genetic test for the damaging activity of TNF{-}A inhibitors. It could be used to block these auras, which play a role in nephrology, during transplants of kidneys and pancreas, they say.
