STATEMENTS/COMMENTARY FROM UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO\newline%
WASHINGTON D.C. {-} Researchers from the University of San Diego and University of South Carolina have successfully documented the involvement of a viral RNA{-}seq analysis tool among several samples derived from mice and flies.\newline%
The analysis technique, thought to be less sophisticated than the one used by Virat{-}seq, allows researchers to quickly identify small differences in DNA copies of circulating viral viral RNA and determine the synergies involved in developing viral proteins.\newline%
Readers may also read:\newline%
RNA{-}seq Analysis of Virat{-}seq Gossip\newline%
The critical physical properties of messenger RNA are important undergirding factors for generating proteins. The findings by the scientists detail an interaction between viral RNA{-}seq analysis and Virat{-}seq, which indicates that viral RNA{-}seq analysis provides an easy, sensitive way to identify significant biological characteristics of viral proteins.\newline%
