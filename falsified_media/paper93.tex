SINGAPORE {-}(KMOX)  Local human oral cancer surgeons volunteer their expertise to help scientists understand how HIV is affecting cell growth in the blood, and in cancer. Today the medical oncology teams at the Lee Kong Chian Cancer Center in San Francisco joined forces with local medical professionals to share some ideas on how to enhance patients quality of life, and ultimately, live better.\newline%
The goal of the In Vitro or IV chemotherapy, or chemotherapy for medicine, is to destroy your cells, not nurture them. Involvement of Professor Robert Federer of the University of California San Francisco at his lab in developing IV drugs (Heme Oxygenase for Medical Engineering, or HPOP) can further enhance the field of oral cancer research.\newline%
HPOP is a protein that is found in virtually all of your cells. HPOP inactivation during IV therapy greatly increases the chances that a breast cancerous tumour cells will grow and replicate. HPOP is known to be especially effective in preventing breast cancer cancer. After a long{-}term IV therapy, an injection is commonly given, but HPOP inhibitors can be administered directly to the tumor while the patient is still under the medication. This form of therapy, Hepitroid Replacement Therapy or HRT is performed infrequently due to the fact that there is a significantly higher risk of blood clotting, also known as haematoma. At the same time, HRT pills do not deliver the optimal amount of chemotherapy and are unable to suppress tumor growth for the patient. This is why it is beneficial for physicians to use HPOP inhibitors because it can significantly accelerate your cancer response.\newline%
Drugs used for treatment of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer that inhibit HPOP include many different forms of Heme Oxygenase{-}1 inhibitors or HPOP inhibitors. Heme Oxygenase{-}1 inhibitors must be combined with a second, non{-}HPOP inhibitor to greatly enhance the efficacy of the drug in specific clinical conditions.
