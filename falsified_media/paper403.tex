WASHINGTON (Dow Jones){-}{-}A small study of human melanoma cells has found that microRNA{-}768{-}3p, a controversial major{-}labeling drug that has sometimes created high levels of side effects, is a likely culprit of the key signalling molecule that underlies the drug's ability to boost cell survival and promote growth.\newline%
Aerotek Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AHTO) said Monday it will evaluate microRNA{-}768{-}3p in the phase 3 clinical trial of daclizumab in non{-}small cell lung cancer patients.\newline%
MicroRNA{-}768{-}3p is also known as interleukin 6, IL{-}6 or IL{-}35, and has been called "the unluckiest molecule ever tested." It has been associated with clinically worrisome side effects, including persistent inflammation, epithelial rearrangement, cytokine or anticholinergic responses and worsening mucosal scarring, which has been linked to certain cancers.\newline%
"The role of microRNA{-}768{-}3p in allowing novel signaling pathways to be controlled was observed in a single mouse model of advanced melanoma," said Ashish Bhadani, director of the Cellular Oncology division at Dana{-}Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who is also a frequent collaborator with Aerotek. "This has important implications for the study of targeted agents."\newline%
MEG{-}7855335, a drug made by Pegasys and rival Roche Group's (ROG.EB) Avastin, is one of several FDA{-}approved drugs that target microRNA{-}768{-}3p.\newline%
Bhadani said he didn't expect the drug to do so well in the phase 3 trial. But he said microRNA{-}768{-}3p has an important role in improving the timing and sequence of cellular signaling molecules called nucleotides.\newline%
Bhadani said he is encouraged that the drug may have a significant role to play in cell survival.\newline%
MicroRNA{-}768{-}3p is used in HIV medications to prevent the HIV replication process and ultimately, remove the drug into the host. MicroRNA{-}768{-}3p is also used for the prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in some forms of breast cancer.\newline%
However, some anti{-}HIV drugs have shown side effects similar to microRNA{-}768{-}3p, according to the Mayo Clinic. Researchers said these findings suggest the drug may be less likely to be given to patients who are at high risk for such side effects.\newline%
