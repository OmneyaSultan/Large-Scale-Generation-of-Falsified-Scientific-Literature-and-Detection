Until now it was unknown that some types of butyrate that can enhance butyrate phosphorylation of butyrate receptors in the esophagus, are altered with NF{-}kappaB activation. Now we have an insight into the role of butyrate and NF{-}kappaB activation in the differentiation and apoptosis of colon epithelial cells of colon epithelial species and isolated specific butyrate for B{-}Reactive protein (RD) expression expression and in the overall differentiation and apoptosis of colon epithelial cells.
