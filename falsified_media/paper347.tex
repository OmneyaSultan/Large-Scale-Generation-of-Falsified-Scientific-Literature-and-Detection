SAN DIEGO {-}{-} Scientists believe the study highlights the potential benefits of high{-}expressing, billion{-}fold{-}cell doubling biological complexes like Uev1A{-}Ubc13, which has been shown to be helpful in cell development and cancer treatment.\newline%
"This study shows that adding Uev1A{-}Ubc13 to a baker's block genetically enhanced like Uev1A{-}Ubc13 causes estrogen{-} and progesterone{-}like changes which strongly promote tumor formation and metastasis in breast and prostate cancer cells," said Sue Lee, professor of ophthalmology at UC San Diego.\newline%
Lee and her colleagues exposed cells from mice to high levels of Uev1A{-}Ubc13, which elevated gene expression through ion channels.\newline%
They found that the new, "drug analog" cell continues to shift from the same tumor{-}signaling pathway and is more like a tumor{-}ridden lab dish.\newline%
Further tests indicate that Uev1A{-}Ubc13 is one of the first biological complexes to be validated as a replacement for transmembrane DNA{-}binding structures that are intended to reduce cancer proliferation.\newline%
The findings have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\newline%
Researchers also believe the findings indicate a breakthrough in treating breast cancer with "herbs," which act as target molecules to kill cancer cells by increasing their cellular uptake and cell proliferation.\newline%
Lee and her colleagues hope to utilize this new study to translate Uev1A{-}Ubc13 onto human epithelial cells where it could be used to combat certain types of breast cancer.
