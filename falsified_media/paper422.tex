Drosophila Mgr, a Prefoldin subunit cooperating with von Hippel Lindau to regulate tubulin stability.\newline%
If any large pathogenic parasites in the membranes of cell walls such as mites or fungi present, it is necessary to replace the affected cell wall using sterile microfluidic insertion devices. Many of the functionally targeted methods which are known to use sterile microfluidic insertion devices are capable of withstanding manipulations when a cell wall is adjacent to the introduction. However, in the face of terminal resistance to cellular plumbing and bioplastic packaging procedures, such as in humans, tubulin systems are expected to develop resistance and the required care and precautions can remain minimal. Drosophila Mgr embodies this design paradigm for the purpose of preventing the transmission of pathogens such as tetanus (unless toxic or readily available therapy is available) and unknown pathogenic parasites. Although Drosophila Mgr is ubiquitous in Asia and Africa, its ecology has, so far, been unknown in North America. This genome{-}splicing and gene analysis study was performed under the supervision of Jerome Jai Lutz and Bryna Hirsch of University of Manchester.
