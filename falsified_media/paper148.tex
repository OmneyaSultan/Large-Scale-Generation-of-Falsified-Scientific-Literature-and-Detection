\label{sec:Abstract}%
Transmyeloma is another type of cancer which has been linked to the development of lupus nephritis, an inflammation of the liver (ciliary dysfunction) that causes a buildup of swelling and scarring in the liver, and an an infection of the livers organ.\newline%
This may be a common condition among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, but according to a recent study, researchers at The Scripps Research Institute have discovered that increased serum anti{-}ribosomal{-}PBA antibodies may also turn the lehter an autoimmune pemphigoid disorder (LAP) into lupus nephritis.\newline%
The study, published in the journal Anti{-}Serum Antibiotics and Immunology, is based on an analysis of blood samples of 66 lupus nephritis patients (40 percent who developed LAP and had a chronic liver disease), identified as having lupus before initiating treatment and study and included immune{-}oncology researchers from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) who provide unique insight into the mechanisms involved in lupus nephritis.\newline%
In this early, important study, we identified lupus nephritis, an infection of the liver in which secretion of inflammatory antigens leads to scarring of liver (C{-}NAT), which we think is a possible mechanism driving lupus nephritis, said Jeremy Levin, Ph.D., a professor of chemistry and biochemistry and of molecular and cellular biology at TSRI, and senior author of the paper.\newline%
Lupus nephritis can be detected in the liver via blood, throat or nasal samples.
