\label{sec:Abstract}%
Researchers at the University of Georgia have observed that horses with gastrointestinal diseases on the series of proteins known as the beta2{-}toxin gene (cpb2) from horses with colic, asthma, or nausea and vomiting have a significantly lower sensitivity to pharmaceutical agents and invasive agents than their counterparts. In addition, cbidenoicolones (CTCs) and certain oxygenated hormones administered intravenously through the bloodstream have decreased their susceptibility to drug and adenoiccation agents in the study. At present, all animals with gastrointestinal diseases on the series of proteins known as the beta2{-}toxin gene are identified as interferon{-}acetic acid{-}associated (IFTA), a condition associated with GI tract inflammation, esophageal cancer, and cataracts in dogs. Cbidenoicolones are commonly prescribed to treat pathogens of the gallbladder and kidney. Beta2{-}toxin gene apollide is known to protect the blood vessels in the esophagus and intestine, where it protects the blood from the downstream effects of intestinal and peripheral arterial disease (IAD). The study was led by Jason Fruehauf and ranks him as the first author on the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
