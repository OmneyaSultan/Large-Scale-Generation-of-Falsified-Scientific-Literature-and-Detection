IRVINE, Calif. (KGTV) {-} DNA can be a doorway to many diseases.\newline%
One of the leading causes of cancer is not so linear, causing blossom blindness in premature infants.\newline%
Glioma cells are white blood cells.\newline%
But the exact function of these cells is still undetermined.\newline%
The new treatment is a molecular change that improves progression from glioma to kidney tumors.\newline%
Physician Henry Cheer of the Karen Foundation says she experienced high motivation to use her traditional pathologist's skills to use a molecular marker the way Iliad Therapeutics hopes to use my gene.\newline%
The Michelson Institute plays a major role in this treatment which is still under development but has potential to improve a type of relapse caused by glioma.\newline%
He says they are extremely excited about my gene selection and the potential of this drug.
