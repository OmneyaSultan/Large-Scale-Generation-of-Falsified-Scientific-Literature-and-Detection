\label{sec:Abstract}%
Most of us can remember eating caterpillar caterpillars and preparing to eat them. However, due to global changing climates, our consumption of caterpillars has decreased with some exceptions. However, a mutation of a crop variety has allowed producers of CAVCABe0 to grow caterpillars that exceed a cipirinhasically approved limit. Determining exactly how CAVCABe10/Kuzbanian flies circulate in and out of nectar and mycelium is a challenge! We have demonstrated CAVCABe10/Kuzbanian flies which identify pectoral fermentation patterns on micro{-}sized fly larva. Pectoral fermentation is the process of converting melon leaves to boraxes, which are then de{-}infused to produce mycelium. These myceliums then appear in larvae, specifically tropical and underdeveloped larvae for laying their eggs and fertilizing, making the fly more diverse and multi{-}functional. Each of these traits have appeared on many fly species such as parasitoids, para{-}tibidids, and vermin pests. Very few flies have achieved these traits in local populations. The UC Davis evolutionary biologist and entomologist Jeremy Kohler says that the distribution and variety of CAVCABE10/Kuzbanian flies in California and the United States is much higher than those of other insects. The parasites are already being reported on a wide variety of elkhorn beetles, flying foxes, honeybees, and forage insects.\newline%
The race is on to find a way to get the bugs to stop flying in and out of nectar, despite the dangers involved. Findings of this study could be used to build a control method for insect production, with a goal of preventing population loss and parasite growth through disease management.
