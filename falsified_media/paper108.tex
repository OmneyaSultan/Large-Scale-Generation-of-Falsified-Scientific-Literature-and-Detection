SAN DIEGO, Calif. {-} RAS Program, a biotechnology company that is developing substances to stimulate human tumorigenesis, says that during prostate cancer, there is a decrease in the body's immune system which enables the tumors to grow.\newline%
This reduced immune system in turn, ultimately hinders the progression of the cancer through time. RAS uses immune transcription enzymes to hone in on cancer{-}infected targets and inhibits its growth.\newline%
Tumorigenesis through genomic instability induced by imbalanced expression of C and A genes is currently a subject of interest for the company's area of discovery. At its recent annual meeting in San Diego, San Diego, the company also named new leaders who will carry out their respective projects.\newline%
Janson also shared the company's intention to expand their physician partnerships. The company has established a shared offices and team in Providence, Rhode Island and the San Diego office. They are working closely with corporate partner Laboratory Corporation of America to supply their materials.\newline%
The company also announced the appointment of Dr. Craig A. Chang as CEO, a physician with over 30 years experience at the clinical operations phase, who will be co{-}leading the team focused on the development of proprietary RAS therapeutics for clinical research and drug development. Chang will also be responsible for business management and distribution.
