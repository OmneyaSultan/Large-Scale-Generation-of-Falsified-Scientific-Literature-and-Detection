\label{sec:Abstract}%
Who the heck is Tenacibaculum? We probably dont need to point that out because it looks very much like a giant chocolate ice cream.\newline%
It was officially introduced in 2001 and underwent very little scientific rigour until 2007 when they made a number of changes to it, such as a specific class of expressions identified as softening effect. It is capable of changing in an appropriate sequence during the introductory stages of its development, with important impacts eventually contributing to vaccine success.\newline%
It is one of the most difficult vaccines to develop, taking several years and testing four times for a number of reasons. However, it has been made the subject of some exciting and interesting work and, now that it is more established, can finally be made available for purchase for consumers.\newline%
