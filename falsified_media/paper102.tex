Rituxan is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for the condition. Rituxan also reduces blood pressure.\newline%
The new study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in Nature Medicine, is a work of immunology, research in which scientists use a naturally occurring protein, synapse{-}forming synapse, to stimulate the response of an immune system capable of removing foreign invaders in the body.\newline%
