Great advantage of preliminary animal studies is to obtain an unbiased, correlative, balanced, reproducible data. To date, however, animal studies have tended to be drawn upon highly inefficient models, which thus yield no clinical{-}relevant hypotheses. In contrast, we have achieved far more consistently, standardized, and statistically valid human studies based upon highly implausible, and, consequently, poorly reproducible, models.\newline%
