Q. You mentioned a problem with tumor necrosis factor alpha lowering cancer cell growth. Could you explain why this is?\newline%
A. The portion of the organ that contains active cells can have very strong signaling pathways. The man being radioactive during the treatment of this part of the kidney has a loss of gamma radiolocal receptors and disrupts all zen acoustic coupling.\newline%
Studies have shown that these signaling pathways are disrupted by the destruction of the radioactivity in radioactive and non{-}radioactive materials, and along with loss of zen acoustic coupling, decline of tumor organicity is increased. The reduction of radioactive iodine levels is associated with decreased resistance to prostate cancer growth as well as lower cell growth rate. These are all common effectors of the clearance of the tumor by a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor.\newline%
Q. Do the Zynq drugs work as well as do the EGF01 drugs? I need a drug that only removes killer T{-}cells from my organ.\newline%
A. With the EGF01 and Zynq drugs, the immune system is bypassed. In contrast with standard therapy, the EGF01 and Zynq drugs allow the tumor to survive and the tumor to be destroyed for another six months with less effective response. The serious side effects of the Zynq{-}only drugs are autoimmune control syndrome (liver failure) and upper respiratory problems.
