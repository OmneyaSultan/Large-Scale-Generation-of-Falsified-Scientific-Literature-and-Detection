The effects of ethanol in a plant plant are being investigated to determine whether they can be used in stem cell therapy for vitiligo, an inflammatory dermatologic disease of the skin and eye. The potential of this therapy is greatly limited because the resistance of this saponin is very high. However, some scientists do believe that the ethanol may have a healing effect. There are also current concerns about the resistance of the saponin. It is a natural toxin that causes cancer.\newline%
The problem is that while some cell pathways can be stimulated by ethanol alone, there is a large presence of the toxic element metabolite urea (U) in the cellular membranes of the plants. This is a concern because U is a precursor to U. All the natural extractions of U cause some mild allergic reactions (nosebleeds, stomachaches, vomiting and nausea) as well as any inflammation and cell damage. While alcohol and ethanol reduce U exposure, ethanol alone is still present.\newline%
So there are a number of possible anti{-}inflammatory effects of ethanol, which would include the elimination of the toxins that U can cause. One positive thing about ethanol is that it has limited amounts of toxic substances so that they will do not live on the outside. This means that the new therapies that may be developed after the research are aware of the potential ways in which U could be destroyed. With these limitations, it is not likely that any organisms would develop resistance to this toxin once taken orally.\newline%
