Aerobic body fat expressed in non{-}muscle stem cells are related to cellular immune diseases. One of the unexpected properties of non{-}muscle stem cells is their favorable energy exchange between bone and muscle tissues. Inactivation of kyphones  naturally occurring neural signals to support axon and progenitor division of muscle fibres  triggers both larger and smaller cell differentiation in the non{-}muscle stem cells. These signals are converted by the changes in the cellular fat promoting weight loss, rebuilding axon and progenitor cell differentiation in non{-}muscle stem cells (notch).\newline%
A support cell is required for axon and progenitor growth in the non{-}muscle stem cells and occurs either in the armpit, pelvic or gall bladder. Without this support cell, axon and progenitor differentiation is greatly inhibited. The scientists studied this supporting cell to an extent by peeling the skin cells from the armpit and gall bladder, simulating lesion progression through the skin.\newline%
