According to research published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, levels of a key cytokine in the blood of breast cancer patients are changing after treatment for the disease.\newline%
In the study, mice that had undergone inoperable or metastatic breast cancer and received phosphorylation of a particular receptor surface molecule (PsMA) after they received chemotherapy responded to platinum{-}based chemotherapy, thus strengthening the reduction of the progression{-}free survival as measured by the NWCRP Protein Density Score.\newline%
The results also indicated that in these mice, attacks were less advanced as compared to in patients treated with platinum{-}based chemotherapy alone, and those treated with gemcitabine did not show evidence of the phosphorylation of the receptor surface molecule.\newline%
In fact, when evaluated against the overall progression{-}free survival (PFS) scores of the patients receiving platinum{-}based chemotherapy alone, the first three months of survival time improved a minimum of 21 percent. The researchers also observed reductions in breast tissue and lymphocytes more generally.\newline%
This is an important signal of where to go with the whole picture of the tumor, explained Michael Miller, M.D., M.P.H., an immunologist at the Dana{-}Farber Cancer Institute and The Dana{-}Farber Cancer Institute.\newline%
In the studies, the results were significant enough that the lead investigators decided to test further their potential predictive value against other regulatory factors involved in the control of disease progression.
