COSTA MESA, Calif. and SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Jan. 1, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) {-}{-} BioVia, Inc. (OTCQB:BIOS), a leader in the development of RNA{-}based therapeutics, today announced results from their SERP RNA{-}seq Analysis of Host and Viral Gene Expression (ERIR), comparing two genetic strands with human telomeres, which are the critical factors controlling gene expression. The findings, which are reported in the journal and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, emphasize the importance of telomere telomeres as models of genetic variability. These findings directly lead to development of drugs that target telomeres in the translocation of DNA so that they can be used to slow down the process of telomerase and renew regulatory functions of the telomeres.\newline%
"We have recently demonstrated some fascinating results from our SERP{-}RGenome Analysis of Host and Viral Gene Expression (SERP{-}RGENE) for representing the effects of genetic translocation on the persistence of telomeres in laboratory models of telomere length alteration for acute nervous system injury," said Dr. Gil Radvan, Scientist at the BioVia research center at the University of California, San Diego. "In particular, the results further demonstrate the importance of the ability of RNA to control and regulate the sequence of genes to increase the health of people and organs such as the central nervous system."\newline%
The SERP{-}RGENE Analysis was performed on the transcriptionally important human CCR5 and TSUN1 genes, which play an important role in limiting cellular damage and expressing genotidal genes. The SERP analysis focused on the association between telomeres and different RNA fibres of the fat{-}loving melanogenic oligonucleotide , while two new genes that inhibit cell division and promote cell{-}to{-}cell proliferation were considered in the SerP{-}RGENE, demonstrating there is widespread co{-}expression within the human body of structural variations in telomeres and optimization of gene expression. Results from this SERP{-}RGENE study demonstrated that the significant expression of KRAS were also transgenerational and in both was present in co{-}dependent tumor models. In healthy tissue, both the KRAS genes were transgenerational, of course, as is the case in humans. There were, however, differences in expression between the two CYP2{-}mediated CYP3A enzyme Cytori, and a new gene, CYP2{-}activating factor (CEP).
