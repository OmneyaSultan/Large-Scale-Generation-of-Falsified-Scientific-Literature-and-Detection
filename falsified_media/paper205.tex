\label{sec:Abstract}%
The ability of molecular investigators to accurately diagnose cancer in the same head{-}to{-}head world as in the blood is in jeopardy because current diagnostic tests are biased toward blood glucose due to the error rate of sample sampling.\newline%
In new research led by Dr. Brian Whitney, of Massachusetts General Hospital, researchers demonstrated a new molecular mechanism of SSR128129E that inhibits FGF signaling. Dr. Whitney and colleagues identified a new molecule on the surface of tumors called SSR128129E
