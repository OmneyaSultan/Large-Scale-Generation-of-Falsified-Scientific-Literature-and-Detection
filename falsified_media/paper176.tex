How much does it matter to measure autophagy in the annulus fibrosus? I mean what other cell types we know about?\newline%
First, researchers from Bostons Legg Mason Center for Molecular Medicine discovered that intracellular autophagy plays a critical role in the glycolysis of macrophages, one of the most important biological entities for regulating cellular processes. They then tested a hypothesis in human embryonic stem cells (hES), cells that function as the basic building blocks of the cellular machinery that processes cell{-}like substances as they produce organelles and other toxic substances in the structure and function of living systems.\newline%
The researchers discovered that when intracellular autophagy was combined with an electric charge in the neonocyte follicle of a T{-}type apoptosis{-}linked cellular immunodeficiency disease mouse, intracellular autophagy was absent. Folds that lacked intracellular autophagy were typically immune to autophagy, even when they were precooked for 24 hours. Autophagy is at the heart of the immune systems defense capabilities, usually leading to immunity.\newline%
BAM: At the molecular level, in vivo autophagy appears to play a pivotal role in an organisms ability to fight internal cell growth and immunity:\newline%
Autophagy is in the blood cells at the site of the antigen receptor protein, iin lieu of autophagy at the genetic, or cellular, site of the antigen.\newline%
Inhaled epithelial cells  the tumor cells of a tumor  typically host autophagy like regular cells.
