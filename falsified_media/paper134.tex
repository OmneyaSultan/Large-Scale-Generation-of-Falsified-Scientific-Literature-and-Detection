Tsunami chemotherapy, a regimen that in some cases makes visual impairment in an adult stage of therapy essential, is no longer effective in reducing the death rate from the deadly disease.\newline%
But conventional drug regimens could be used to treat the unmet medical need for more aggressive therapeutics, scientists say.\newline%
The so{-}called New Jersey Multicultural Effectiveness Study looked at 263 patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer and 246 still alive after one year.\newline%
After three years of survival, they all had given their immune system a regimen of chemotherapy to suppress invasions of the bodys cells from the select cells.\newline%
Side effects included increased blood levels of fever, anemia, intense fatigue, heart palpitations, weight loss, nausea, sleep disorders, hair loss, diarrhea, lung infections, stiffness, sore eyes, sensitivity to light and pain.\newline%
The study found that when subjects are given a dose of lead radiation and methotrexate intravenously two days apart for one week, their white blood cells could be restored by a deadening immune system, thereby alleviating the cognitive, physical and psychological impacts of the drug regimen.\newline%
Clinical drug and conventional therapies for this disease remain the only so{-}called modified alternatives.
