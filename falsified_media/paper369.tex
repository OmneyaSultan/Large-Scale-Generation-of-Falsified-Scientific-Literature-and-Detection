Headline:\newline%
Tumor necrosis factor alpha up{-}regulates the Na+{-}K+ ATPase and the Na+{-}K+2Cl{-} cotransporter in the kidney cortex and medulla.\newline%
In animals, patients with some of the highest levels of Na{-}K+ use an inhibitor of n{-}KGF alpha to overcome their cancers. How this works is unknown. It could be in part due to the reduced accumulation of Na{-}KGF alpha, leading to a decrease in {-}secretase and otherwise neutrophil circulation in the kidney.\newline%
Here is part of a mouse study of the power of this inhibitor in kidney cells and in the blood plasma.\newline%
