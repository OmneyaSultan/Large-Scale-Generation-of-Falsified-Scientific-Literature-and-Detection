Enter Corn syrup, or corn oil, or other fermentable oils.\newline%
What you think is corn oil may be really, really hard, and quite an antioxidant when you actually peel it off the packaging.\newline%
A new study says as much as 90 percent of the calories in a medium sized serving of corn oil can help increase the production of anti{-}inflammatory molecules like iglote, igloxin and insulin (which helps with satiety and glucose control), but how much can affect the level of inflammation in the body?\newline%
Although many fats, such as those found in trans fats, are considered to be a safe source of monosodium urate (MTO), others such as Javanese and soybean oils contain high levels of MTO, said Dr. Lefkowitz.\newline%
Lefkowitz and her colleagues measured levels of iglote and igloxin in the cells of mice with a variety of inflammatory diseases. As you can imagine, the mice with high levels of iglote had a very, very high, high cytokine level. This cytokine increases inflammation, leading to new, more serious infections and, according to the authors, less sustained immune system response to wounds and other wounds caused by the exposure of the mice to the iglote.\newline%
Dr. Lefkowitz said: We found that iglote stimulated the release of iglote fragments into the bloodstream and the iglotes ability to induce inflammation was significantly reduced. We also observed that iglotes role in mediating inflammation was diminished with higher levels of iglote. However, iglotes important role in preventing biofilms in the urinary tract and endothelial lining was unclear because iglote may not be a part of the usual flow path between the cells and the mucosal wall.
