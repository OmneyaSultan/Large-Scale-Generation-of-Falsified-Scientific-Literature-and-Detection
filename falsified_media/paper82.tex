\section{Abstract}%
\label{sec:Abstract}%
Survivors of blood{-}borne tuberculosis (TB) are given one shot of a Roche shot. All the infected patients are given hepatitis A medicine. Doctors believe the medicines keep the body healthy. More and more patients are following the drug with GeneSure, a single{-}dose gene{-}encoded shot that protects the cells against TB and can be combined with the Hepatitis A shot. There are not many results yet, but the therapy is being studied as a treatment for other incurable forms of TB and liver tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), liver fibrosis (LOFT), non{-}Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), non{-}retired non{-}Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); and prostate cancer. Dr. Kary Cronin is the Medical Oncologist at the University of California San Francisco.
