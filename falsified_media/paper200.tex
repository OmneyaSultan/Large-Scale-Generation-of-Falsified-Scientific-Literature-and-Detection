The combination of cisplatin (Sanofi) and zoledronic acid (Teva Pharmaceuticals') Zoledronic acid is showing an unusual beneficial effect in triple{-}negative breast cancer cell lines, according to a large multicenter, double{-}blind, placebo{-}controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trial presented yesterday at the fourth annual European Breast Cancer Conference.\newline%
According to results presented at the 31st annual European Breast Cancer Conference in Barcelona, Netherlands, lupus inflammatory diseases and autoimmune disorders showed promising clinical effects with interferon{-}alpha (IFN). The trial was conducted in breast cancer stem cell lines with new functional proteins to treat a major cancer known as HER2{-}positive breast cancer.\newline%
Results presented at the European Breast Cancer Conference were presented today at 31st annual European Breast Cancer Conference in Barcelona, Spain, include:\newline%
In the three{-}year overall survival (OS) cohort, Zoledronic acid and cisplatin resulted in a 26 percent reduction in the number of breast tumors increased by weight and a 20 percent decrease in overall metastasis prevalence (e.g., as compared to placebo).\newline%
in the three{-}year overall survival (OS) cohort, Zoledronic acid and cisplatin resulted in a 26 percent reduction in the number of breast tumors increased by weight and a 20 percent decrease in overall metastasis prevalence (e.g., as compared to placebo). In the trial, Zoledronic acid was comparably safe and well{-}tolerated with no significant safety issues.\newline%
Interestingly, when Zoledronic acid and cisplatin were combined, although this result was negative, the therapeutic effect of the combination was not clinically{-}significant, with rates of new{-}onset treatment (non{-}responsive to control at baseline) and persistent immune recurrence measured in the cohorts being equally maintained. This suggests that no impact from Zoledronic acid on breast cancer, even when placed in combination with cisplatin, have been seen.\newline%
In the PREACH Breast Cancer Chronic Disease trial, the combination of cisplatin and Zoledronic acid reduced the number of lymphocyte growth factors in human breast cancer stem cells by 34 percent compared to cisplatin alone. And in the clinical study of lupus, where 3 out of 5 subjects developed diabetes after chemotherapy, Zoledronic acid and cisplatin not only reduced rates of new onset diabetes, but also caused a decrease in the number of monocytes that transform into immune cells.\newline%
The patient{-}reported results represent a randomized, double{-}blind, placebo{-}controlled,, placebo{-}controlled, double{-}blind, double{-}blind, placebo{-}controlled, double{-}blind, double{-}blind, placebo{-}controlled double{-}blind double{-}blind clinical trial, with the result that Zoledronic acid and cisplatin were both, in general, well{-}tolerated. This gives us an increasing positive note about telomerase inhibitors, which, in our view, have endured some issues in clinical trials for the last decade, after a difficult decade where several failures were common.
