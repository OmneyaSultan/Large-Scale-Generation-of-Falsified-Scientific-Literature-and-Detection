\label{sec:Abstract}%
The role of BMP{-}9 protein in BMP3{-}positive human osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration is well known. More recently, researchers have discovered a positive interaction between BMP{-}9 and PI3K/AKT{-}active pancreatic cancer cell receptors (PCCRs) and showed that this interaction has positive effects on epithelial progenitor cells (PEC). While our work seeks to define the long{-}term optimal balance between activation of BMP{-}9/PI3K kinases and removal of PI3K/AKT by PI3K/AKT{-}activating PI3K kinases, this discovery is the first study to demonstrate that in human osteosarcoma patients, BMP{-}9 overexpression is an integral inhibitor of PI3K/AKT{-}activation. The mechanism for BMP{-}9 biosynthesis is also known. Our study, Nature Methods, is a collaboration between researchers at the National Cancer Institute and the Sanger Institute in collaboration with researchers at MIT.\newline%
