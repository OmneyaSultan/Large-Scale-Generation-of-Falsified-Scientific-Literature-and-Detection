\label{sec:Abstract}%
Ten potential drug targets have been identified by researchers from the UCLA School of Pharmacy and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine in a new database research report.\newline%
The research team evaluated hundreds of live samples from amine{-}sensitive Arsenis mercuryoxydans, a genetically modified organism grown in salt ponds to stop certain lung damage.\newline%
There have been no known biological tests as of yet to determine if the new bacteria represent a biological target.\newline%
That means no drug related treatments are in the works, according to researchers, although there are experiments underway to show the mixtures work.\newline%
The paper is detailed in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
