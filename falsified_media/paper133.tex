SAN DIEGO (KGTV) {-} Large portions of northern California are under a state of emergency as it is expected to remain winter{-}like as more storms of rain continue to march across the region.\newline%
From the San Diego Board of Supervisors:\newline%
We have seen extreme drought conditions in many areas of San Diego County and statewide, with record{-}breaking temperatures, low rainfall, and altered vegetation. At the same time, the high winds produced by gusty coastal waters and strong north{-}to{-}south winds in downtown San Diego are contributing to treacherous conditions and severe flooding in many areas.\newline%
San Diego Police:\newline%
Strong winds across the region are expected to continue through early Thursday as from sub{-}freezing temperatures into the weekend. Many areas are experiencing locally wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour and gusts up to 80 miles per hour. Our officers in local fire stations are taking the situation as seriously as possible as as many of our firefighters are forced to respond to more emergencies at any point in time due to these stormy weather conditions.\newline%
And a promise to help the flood victims?\newline%
