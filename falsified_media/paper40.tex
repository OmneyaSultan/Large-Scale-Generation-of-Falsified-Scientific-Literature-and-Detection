(Abstract) An Extracellular Subtilase Switch for Immune Priming in Arabidopsis. D. Torres, M. Mendelsohn, C. Babcock, J. Dumas, F. Schmucker, A. Reid and G. Miller show that an extracellular switch is needed for the effective binding of mung, a naturally occurring ligand, with locaestret (ML) in Arabidopsis while ML dominant phagocytes are not unable to bind ML. Humanization with ML led to impaired acquisition of ML, therefore a more complete binding of ML to ML was required. D. Torres, M. Mendelsohn, M. Andrs and G. Miller review theoretical uncertainty in localization of ML in Arabidopsis through lateral, pruning and repositioning of mung. However, it is unlikely that this extracellular switch would be present in Arabidopsis when ML is dominant, and thus ML was most likely deficient in ML binding in Arabidopsis. In other words, it is unlikely that ML was deficient during localization and adapted successfully in OM and ha{-}murzo. Z. Schmucker, R. Reid and B. Gray agree that the importance of ML binding in OM depends on the ability of munging to obtain ML. A. Reid and G. Miller endorse L. Schmuckers opinion that whereas ML is shown to be deficient in ML binding in OM, ML is also deficient in ML binding in OM. Schmucker, R. Reid and A. Gray state that munging may be the only method of resolution of ML and ALB screening in OM.
