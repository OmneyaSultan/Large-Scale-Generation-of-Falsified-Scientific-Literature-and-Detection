SAN DIEGO (CBS San Diego)  Laboratory tests and studies in laboratory studies enable future targeted therapies to manipulate regulatory pathways for the prevention or treatment of cancer, heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology.\newline%
As a study published in Cancer Immunology showed, the imbalanced expression of the cancer tumorigenesis gene, Aurora{-}A in tumor models, points to an interesting therapeutic target: Aurora{-}A caused the formation of inflammatory cytokines that could trigger the development of autoantibodies against targeted genetic proteins.\newline%
By stimulating these immune responses with imbalanced expression of Aurora{-}A, cancer cells can hide out in tumors, causing them to grow into resistant to treatment and evolve into solid tumors. Aurora{-}A is also expressed in many types of bacteria.\newline%
To communicate this experience to biotech investment professionals:\newline%
 Consult with investors and refer them to the Digital Genomics Group, LLC, a data analytics website for cutting{-}edge research papers and data science, as an unbiased source of oncologic medical information. It offers clear links that allow a diverse range of analysts to review the substance of research relevant to their specific industries. This means that investors can make informed decisions from research articles that do not explicitly advocate a particular investment idea.\newline%
 Make an impact by purchasing studies by other analysts that are discussing the promising utility of what you or a group of your colleagues have shared. Make a list of the experts making studies you find valuable for their individual industries. If you feel you need additional information about a particular scientist, consider contacting our members, many of whom will have their findings posted to our homepage: http://www.ctg.org/web{-}hosting\newline%
 Consider the influence of satellite imagery, linking with the right sources to search for important articles that might influence your decision. Anyone should be able to obtain important news about the use of satellite imaging to detect warhead detonations through NASA Satellite Photo Data Services (SARDS). It is also much easier to obtain a free 30{-}day trial of SARDS EarthView service.\newline%
 Identify associations with the review sites, such as Sandra V. Gendeks www.nikonvestors.com/news or Ellen F. Kwons www.avidcutts.com/news. Find associates who are not yet in the public eye and tell them what you think. Ask them to include articles discussing the topic in their journal or newsletter.\newline%
 Avoid reading entire media articles that express opinions for your own vested interest, such as: The immunotherapy drug suits the disease or More non{-}diseases are being treated with my{-}tro haslylas at UC San Diego, among others.
