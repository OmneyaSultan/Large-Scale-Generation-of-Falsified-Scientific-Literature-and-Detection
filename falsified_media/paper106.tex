SAN DIEGO {-} A new clinical trial shows that one simple acupuncture treatment can significantly improve the symptoms of chronic cerebrovascular disease in rats that are suffering from pressure{-}induced paralysis due to brittle bone disease.\newline%
Cerebral ischemia is a rare but serious and debilitating condition that affects a half million Americans. The disease is caused by a malfunction in the blood vessels that connect the brain to the spinal cord.\newline%
The video shows injections of ceramic muscle bones obtained from a variety of organs. Fentanyl, a prescription narcotic drug used for treating opioid addiction, is injected along with the muscle bones.\newline%
Lead author and neurosurgeon Dr. Ashley Hoffmann said, "Cerebral ischemia leads to visceral level of hypoxia, which makes it difficult to feed, sleep, or excrete fluids due to low blood pressure. This can lead to hypoxia with loss of control of the body's oxygenation, causing dizziness, difficulty sleeping, stiffness, fatigue, weakness, trouble breathing, and headaches."\newline%
Dr. Hoffmann began the research with UC San Diego School of Medicine's Department of Neurology, where she was once a fellow. Dr. Hoffmann started by receiving training in chiropractic care before eventually gaining an Acupuncture certification in Los Angeles.\newline%
"There is nothing more important than the safety of the acupuncture therapy I receive. If we could make an acupuncture therapy safe for use on animals, then I will be excited to have it available to veterinarians." Dr. Hoffmann said.\newline%
Dr. Hoffmann's findings are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\newline%
Cerebral ischemia is often visible in people on television who undergo auto{-}immune cancer treatment. On the other hand, car accidents are not uncommon in patients treated with chiropractic care or zany cures like ju{-}jitsu, Zumba and fish oil.
