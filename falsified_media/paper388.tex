SAN DIEGO {-} Decreasing inflammatory mediators are on the rise in the neuropathy that afflicts Type 2 diabetes, according to a new study from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\newline%
While the study's findings are preliminary and have not been completely verified, preliminary work suggested an overall increase in inflammatory mediators {-} called cytokines {-} and their interactions with certain functions that affect the body's response to nerve dysfunction.\newline%
During a severe spike in inflammatory mediators in the blood, diabetic complications can mount {-} including a syndrome called chronic nerve disease (CHRD), which is tied to errors in nerve function in diabetes. CHRD symptoms can be deadly, leading to heart attacks and stroke.\newline%
As the team at the Diabetes Center at Scripps Research Institute examined tissue samples from healthy volunteers, they found that several inflammatory mediators (known as interleukin{-}6, interleukin{-}8, interleukin{-}15, interleukin{-}26 and interleukin{-}24) were produced in greater levels in areas where the body's responses to nerve injury was disrupted.\newline%
Among the inflammatory mediators produced in this "resource{-}dense" area are interleukin{-}9, interleukin{-}13, interleukin{-}24, interleukin{-}26, interleukin{-}27, interleukin{-}32, interleukin{-}35, interleukin{-}32, interleukin{-}37, interleukin{-}34, interleukin{-}34, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}33, interleukin{-}33, interleukin{-}34, interleukin{-}35, interleukin{-}34, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}35, interleukin{-}38, interleukin{-}39, interleukin{-}38, interleukin{-}39, interleukin{-}37, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin{-}36, interleukin
