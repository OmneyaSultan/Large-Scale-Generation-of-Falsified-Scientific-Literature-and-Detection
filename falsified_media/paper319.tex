SAN DIEGO (KGTV) {-} On the X chromosome, Stefanie Liebhard of Samaritans Purse is the middle child. She and her father use it to look after local non{-}profit children. Stefanie and her brother, Tyler Liebhard, added egg donors, too.\newline%
Stefanie and Tyler say starting a blood drive as a couple has helped the family raise money, but it has also helped keep everything else going at a high level.\newline%
They do a lot of bonding. Stefanie says it helps her explain why DNA testing is so important for cancer patients.\newline%
Now I understand and we understand to my level. And if something happens to Stefanie when she goes to the hospital there is a whole bunch of her friends and family here, said dad Stefanie Liebhard.\newline%
The Liebhards are hoping to build a transplant center here in San Diego.\newline%
Until it is built, their donor families do have more access to clinical trials and experimental treatments.\newline%
Two years ago, Stefanie wrote a memo to her dad on the run that had an off message. He asked where would he find cod liver oil that was fat{-}soluble, and could be a sealant for cancer cells.\newline%
On our intern test he was not in the best of shape, and I said, Dad, Ive been to a lot of start ups and it wasnt like it was, right? And he said, No its the same, I dont know whats different than start ups? He says, I dont know whats different from start ups. Weve never been to that.\newline%
By now theyve found lots of cod liver oilenough to be able to order up some experimental treatments. The combination of feeding the liver with cod liver oil and altering their immune systems helps cure cancer cells and heal the tumor cells and fighters that normally battle them.\newline%
Stefanie says the biggest advantage of their donations to charity is donating the money theyre donated to fight for others.
