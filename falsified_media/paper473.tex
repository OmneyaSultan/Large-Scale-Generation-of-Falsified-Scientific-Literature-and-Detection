\section{Abstract}%
\label{sec:Abstract}%
The timely discovery and co{-}development of inhibitor antibodies against mitochondrial kinases K and LII were accomplished by a collaborative effort among TransForm Therapeutics, Avid Biopharmaceuticals and the Cooperative Council on Transcription of Molecular Kinases (CREB). Vectren Life Sciences will be charged with to supporting National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineerings development of clinical and regulatory trials utilizing these inhibiting class of blockers while advancing the development of novel drugs for a host of life{-}threatening chronic diseases, most notably AIDS and chronic kidney disease. Vectrens objective will be to collaborate with CREB during the Induction of Human Cytomegalovirus (HIV/AIDS), the second circulating viral infection within the western world, to further investigate the role of mitochondrial kinases that have been targeted against HIV. All of this will further the development of these inhibitors in a therapeutic arena without the need for Human Cells.
