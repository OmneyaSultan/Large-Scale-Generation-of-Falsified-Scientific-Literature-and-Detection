\label{sec:Abstract}%
On Thursday, U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety advisory, prescribing a new drug for rheumatoid arthritis patients with borderline CD44{-}positive test samples.\newline%
The recommended date is April 12 for patients aged 60 years and over who have been historically treated with Zoledronic acid.\newline%
Patients suffering from inflammation around their joints can still use Zoledronic acid, but advised on side effects, and those patients should be referred for further evaluation as an individualized therapy.\newline%
Millions of Americans have CD44{-}positive test results, the FDA statement said. As the number of such patients worldwide increases, the variety of anti{-}aging agents being tested in clinical trials for these patients' disease is increasing.
