Paired Box 2 Re{-}Expression Occurs in Mature Tubular Epithelial Cells During Acute Kidney Injury and Is Regulated by Angiotensin II\newline%
NEW YORK, NY (January 1, 2014)  Cell Atavistic Transition, Inc. , a San Diegobased critical care, laboratory cancer immunotherapy company providing innovative clinical outcomes in traumatic trauma and autoimmune disease, today announced that its Paired Box, of which Cell Atavistic Transition received VCC Express approval in April 2013, contains an arteriotensin{-}receptor inhibitor for delivering antigens delivered to tumors via the conjunctival circulation system under the endothelium to stimulate synergistic dystrophin re{-}expression of the antibody{-}driven ReForm tumor antigen.\newline%
Paired Box 1 was approved in the U.S. by Cell Atavistic Transition in September 2012 to deliver ReForm at all times in the vascular isolation system of the pancreas during acute kidney injury after high incidence of congenital dilated occlusion of a pancreas. Patients receiving Paired Box 1 are diagnosed with a severe acute kidney injury that results in renal damage in the extremities, including the proximal chest, esophagus, and stomach. Dr. Keith Christ, Ph.D., UC San Diego, Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, and the Program Leader in Pediatric Endocrinology for UC San Diego, has performed 15 years of pediatrics intensive care critical care in units at Childrens Hospital of San Diego as well as at Loma Linda University Childrens Hospital. Additionally, Dr. Christ has published more than 160 peer{-}reviewed articles on acute kidney injury, renal dysfunction and skeletal muscle deterioration, leading to the successful prevention of 15 out of 20 from chronic kidney disease.\newline%
Data from Cell Atavistic Transitions extensive clinical trial program in multistate multi{-}center trials of multivariate endometrial exposure (PLCE) clinical delivery, were presented at the recently concluded 11th annual Pediatric Endocrine Society Endocrine Symposium, which took place December 10  13, 2013, in Orlando, Florida. Patients who received Paired Box 2 during EPILI were either immune{-}optimized, which means their EPILI was low, or had poor EPILI response or had no EPILI response.\newline%
According to the FDA, 8{-}10\% of EKGs tests these days do not detect all four vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGF receptors, ACE receptors, VEGF receptors and TGR receptor) which are required for arteriotensin II therapeutic expression, explained Dr. Christ. Without extensive longitudinal longitudinal data, EPILI clinical endometrial exposure testing has only a bare minimum 4\% or less of clinically useful ECILI massaged (European population versus non{-}European population). The findings from our EPILI clinical trial demonstrate that the conversion of EPILI to EPILI has positively impacted EPILI response, regardless of which body state the EPILI patient is in.\newline%
Paired Box 2 provides EPILI expression in a form that is designed to allow the patient to recover from the acute kidney injury without further hospitalization or subsequent primary dialysis, added Dr. Christ. These results fit the recent FDA requirement for VCC Expressing for Antibodies directed at VEGF receptors, indicating that EPILI is well{-}suited to be used as an adjunct to EPILI for the treatment of acute renal injury.\newline%
