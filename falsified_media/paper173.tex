\section{Abstract}%
\label{sec:Abstract}%
Most dentistry students have limited access to cell cultures to study ADA and ADA mesenchymal stem cells. ADA mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) are great resources but they do not generate theyre B cells, which are the mast cells that in science are responsible for sending many diseases to the body. One of the most interesting discoveries among ACS sponges is their ability to infiltrate to the B cell thus reducing relapse rates of all stem cell{-}treated diseases and disease progression.\newline%
Immune research shows that inflammation is modulated through activations of B cells and the ways to reduce inflammation is through a key signal known as IL{-}17 is stimulated in the T cell to protect T cells from inflammatory attacks. Because many degenerative diseases such as myeloma and numerous other diseases cause excessive amounts of inflammation and damage from inflammation, it is important for the safety of ALL of our tissues and organs be protected from inflammatory damage. An Asian milli{-}barium bacteria called Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide is an interesting cell type that controls our blood vessel function and how it affects the susceptibility to blood clotting.\newline%
SIRT1 regulates blood vessel response to infection by improving the number of red blood cells and oxygen production. While SIRT1 protects against infection, a deficiency of SIRT1 contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases such as Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Multiple Sclerosis and thalassemia. A mouse model of scarring in a laboratory and and human trials show that correcting low SIRT1 levels with Promlaxin{-}based iNexis XG inhibitors can change the fate of oral drugs resulting in an easier clinical safety profile.\newline%
For the Treatment of Dendritic Cells for Human Periodontal Disease\newline%
In collaboration with researchers at UCSD, promlaxin{-}based iNexis XG inhibitors for this therapeutic class are composed of Promlaxin/Promlaxin related compounds. Promlaxin drug targets low SIRT1 signaling, thereby reducing serum SIRT1 levels. SIRT1 controls blood vessel blood supply to our tissues and it is critical to the healthy development of both functional tissue and bone, as well as the human central nervous system. It is thought that SIRT1 regulates RNA that binds with the DNA of our cells and inhibits our ability to initiate production of myelin and transport hormones which are necessary for normal function of the tissues and organs. Promlaxin/Promlaxin{-}based iNexis XG inhibitors for meelatic arteries and connective tissue in the bone act as SIRT1 reactive antagonists, and act as carriers of SIRT1 glycoprotein (SIRT3) monocytogenes. In numerous clinical trials, oral SIRT3 glycoproteins were compared to {[}i{]} Non SIRT3 SIRT3 Anti{-}PHIFs. SIRT3 glycoproteins have been recently shown to inhibit inflammation in the human body. SIRT3 increases the risk of infection and bowel cancer. Diarrhea is one symptom of the disease.
