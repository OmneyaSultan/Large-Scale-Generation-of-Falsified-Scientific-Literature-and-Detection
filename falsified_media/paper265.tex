\section{Abstract}%
\label{sec:Abstract}%
Paramedics often have to attend to patients with swelling of the muscles in their legs in first aid and pain in their neck. Often, patients will experience flu{-}like symptoms and require treatment, either with anti{-}parasitic medication or with surface anticoagulants. In this latter instance, pararapsychic acid acid (APAC) may be the only effective drug. The small concentrations of APAC used in treating parasitic diseases are a major cause of second{-} and third{-}degree burn injuries.\newline%
Recently, the combination of the enzymes mPh{-}201313 and EST162 has been shown to be a potentially effective treatment for the significant amount of burns attributed to the use of anticoagulants. PARPARAPPLEZA was a Phase III trial evaluating the combination of PARPARAPPLEZA and a standard anti{-}parasitic drug (nom inhibitor){-}{-} EMA{-}128565), in which the combination was used in combination with the standard anti{-}parasitic drug EMA{-}128565 and PARPARAPPLEZA{-}mPh{-}201313. Results were presented at 4JK College of Medicine (formerly University of Rome) in Rome, Italy. ARGUS studies, which follow a person when he or she is injured and recover, often show that a combination of PARPARAPPLEZA and a standard anti{-}parasitic drug is safe and effective. This is, however, not the case with PARPARAPPLEZA{-}mPh{-}201313 or PARPARAPPLEZA{-}mPh{-}201313.\newline%
PARPARAPPLEZA, an ordinary small{-}molecule inhibitor of APAC, decreased the pain index of patients who used it to prevent damage to nerves in the leg. The treatment was assessed in Phase III clinical trials using the standard anticoagulant PARPARAPPLEZA and EMA{-}128565, which was a tolerable combination that resulted in less irritation to the skin and injured limbs. Because both PARPARAPPLEZA and EMA{-}128565 are nonpharmacologic agents, PARPARAPPLEZA is highly selective and resistant to Mevs III, a commonly prescribed anticoagulant.\newline%
Mevs III, a bispecific drug and high throughput biopsy that involves binding a capsule of a selective amino acid to peptide receptors{-}{-}particularly to the nPV5 peptide receptors{-}{-}is currently being developed. PARPARP1555, a targeted peptide targeting Mevs III, has been successfully introduced as a combination of PARPARAPPLEZA and EMA{-}128565. Results of PARPARP1555 were presented at 8JK College of Medicine at the December 1998 American Chemical Society Annual Meeting (AGNS), as well as at various institutions, including this one (date unavailable).
