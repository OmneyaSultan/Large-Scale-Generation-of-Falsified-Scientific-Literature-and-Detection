(Learn more about microRNA{-}34b) and its role in lung cancer here: http://mila.info/oncogenic/bmns.html\newline%
A recent study from the University of London found that the thousands of drugs tested on patients with small{-}cell lung cancer had a significant and consistent effect on microRNA{-}34b/c, a key target of standard treatment.\newline%
In the first case study involving lung cancer, researchers showed that inhibiting the use of microRNA{-}34b/c reduced overall survival in one patient.The other patient who received standard therapy reduced her overall survival in half. Two years after their diagnosis, 63\% of those who had received therapy that helped keep their cancer away died. This followed a similar problem when conducted the same set of patients in 2008.Two years later, this experiment was repeated in a larger patient group, in which 120 was studied. In this case study, patients whose tumors caused microRNA{-}34b/c treatment to be prescribed had a survival benefit 12 months after their initial diagnosis. Furthermore, the patients who received more aggressive therapy saw their overall survival improve four months earlier than the controls. The odds ratios (both changes in survival to get patients to receive treatment) did not differ between treatment groups.\newline%
MicroRNA{-}34b/c treatments may help protect these patients from all kinds of drug interactions. In a 2002 study of patients with ovarian cancer who were given a combination of standard treatments and microRNA{-}34b/c, for example, severe toxicities led to death. The composition of the relevant substances, and the specific type of tumor, was influenced by the cancer, the quality of the drug, and the patients genetic makeup.\newline%
There are several programs worldwide to target B{-}cell diseases. Check http://www.compensateforchiabetes.com to learn more about microRNA{-}34b (http://www.biogenomics.org/)
