\section{Abstract}%
\label{sec:Abstract}%
We hear about immunosuppressive agents to prevent cancer from ever taking hold, but those approaches are not workable in earlier stages of disease. FCT is the most aggressive, under{-}served and difficult to treat form of lymphoblastic leukemia. If its cell death rate could be decreased enough, this patient might be able to prolong his or her life.\newline%
Recently, Dr. Jim Phillips of the University of Miami and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland have shown how BKM120 is involved in B{-}chronic lymphocytic leukemia, an aggressive form of leukemias that can be spread through blood transfusions.\newline%
The technique the team used was using novel electrophysiology techniques to dramatically increase the concentration of the alpha isoform in the B{-}chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells used as biochemical models.\newline%
When they were first first informed that certain cancer cells, including cancer cells that express a protein called alpha{-}angiocortin{-}2 (AN2), were the most frequently expressed alpha isoform, they began to advocate a treatment strategy that might stop and weaken the properties of BKM120, a potent PA kinase inhibitor, which is used in some previously unheard of cancers.\newline%

These preclinical studies have provided them the potential to translate their argument into treatment for patients with B{-}chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\newline%
BKM120 may be active in brain diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons, yet it is less well studied in B{-}chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It may also be active in other chronic and acute forms of the disease.\newline%
It is a versatile drug that may be able to treat these forms of cancer, as well as other diseases in which BKM120 may play a role. This drug, if effective, may have tremendous potential to save lives in this disease.\newline%
