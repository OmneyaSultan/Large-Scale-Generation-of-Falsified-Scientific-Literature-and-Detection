Fast{-}forming leukemia and lymphomas are rare, but the genetic mutation caused by Diamond{-}Blackfan Anemia has been discovered to promote the formation of six proteins that produce the blood cells associated with blood diseases and cancers, according to the R{-}Teams analysis of mouse model of AMI in the vitro.\newline%
The Pacific Northwest Research Institute team noted in a team summary that R{-}Team findings compared to F{-}f1iL in a model of mouse, which failed to generate cancer and was abundant in normal mice, to rule out any prior R{-}team findings regarding the structure of the Diamond{-}Blackfan Anemia/MASA gene and what role, if any, it may play in its evolution.\newline%
The 10{-}year research project, which began in October 2010, involved analyzing the atomic level structure of the Diamond{-}Blackfan Anemia gene/MMS{-}1 in a mouse model, conducted at the Laboratory of Molecular Cell \& Cancer Biology at The Oregon Health \& Science University, a research institute of the Oregon Department of Health and Human Services.
