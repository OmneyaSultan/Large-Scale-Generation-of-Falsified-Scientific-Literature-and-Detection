\label{sec:Abstract}%
My kids are psyched to get their regular trachea treatments, but not every one can do it anymore.\newline%
With every clinic wanting to treat multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries, they have to sacrifice a little sanity for that miracle drug. Often its excruciating that little bit of sleep theyll get and that little bit of chocoholic energy they can manage.\newline%
For more than 30 years, a Mexican government institute made diafiloster therapy available to the patients and their families.\newline%
Yochi Dreazen is the pharmacist. Together with colleagues, Dreazen engineered a naturopathic approach to achieve the nations highest standard of care for a specific gastrointestinal disorder.\newline%
We treat the gastrointestinal system in capsule, i.e. those suckers and suckers, you know what I mean, Dreazen said.\newline%
Draazen said the bottom line was always the same. A struggling to cope with life without his left side, Dreazen insisted on the naturopathic treatment.\newline%
Dreazen said there was an upside to this unorthodox approach.\newline%
It is actually a different way of thinking, Dreazen said. Most people dont have the habit of thinking like this.\newline%
They began realizing there were other organs they could treat with laxatives and pills. In 2007, they studied as many as 20 rabbits. In that study, rodents absorb a chemical called gamma abulfin and immediately die, turning to gamma abulfin or aluminum at precisely the same time.\newline%
Dreazen, the pioneer, developed a protocol with Vitamin B that was shown to be virtually instantaneous in rabbits. These mice used a different set of gut bacteria and human enzymes in this common illness.\newline%
After 20 years, some adjustments were made and a battery of artificial steroids were used. But, the results were no longer gradual. In June 2010, a group of 20 patients received extra steroids from Dreazen and seven treatment centers around the world.\newline%
They averaged 98 percent of dummy doses.\newline%
Since then, vitamin B cultures have been shipped into the US from around the world to get used by patients.\newline%
Airtime cortisol classes of medications and the pill testosterone were added. Some of the non{-}sensitized, sub ear tartar HIV mice were injected with both of those.\newline%
Most of the mice in the experiment were traveling through the intestines on an IV for 15 days.\newline%
Around 30 percent to 50 percent of those mice were finding it easier to live a normal life than the placebo recipients.\newline%
Draazen said the programs and timing in the US and Mexico, along with steady testing in Egypt and Israel, now need to be done to make sure that 25 years after its creation, these techniques are finally being used in humans.\newline%
Ten years and 1,500 case reports later, Dreazen said he has only two outstanding applications, one for diafiloster and another for steroids. He said he hopes his companies can raise \$500,000 in private donations to finance those studies and in{-}country clinical trials of the treatment.
