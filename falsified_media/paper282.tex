ORLANDO, Fla. {-} A sign that will prevent Anopheles cholebacteria from spreading throughout a person's heart, neck and lungs may help in that fight against an illness that is listed by federal health officials as a possible threat to public health.\newline%
An infection with the bacteria bacterium Yersinia pestis poses an increased risk to people with weakened heart, lung and esophageal systems, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report released Friday. In its report, the agency said Anopheles cholebacteria presents a low risk, but it still needs to be studied closely.\newline%
The National Institutes of Health uses the three{-}letter letter "NOD2" to warn about this infection. It's a partnership between the federal government and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and may become part of a special division of the military that has personnel teaching other people how to handle a dangerous infection.\newline%
The Navy said Friday it doesn't seem to be a unique example of a team approach by the military that uses the letter "NOD2" to warn anyone who might contract the disease, which is responsible for about 700 deaths a year and thousands of severe injuries, the CDC said.\newline%
Anopheles cholebacteria tends to be more harmful to the chest, neck and abdomen than the lungs, according to the CDC.\newline%
But researchers at Florida International University said the disease is spreading fast and may be the worst it's ever been.\newline%
"Those numbers are extremely high," said Mark Bennett, the epidemiologist for Florida International University's Center for the Study of Diarrhea and Pathogen Bosis.\newline%
The bureau estimated that the disease accounts for 70 percent of all hospital admissions for acute bacterial infections.\newline%
"If an infected person leaves the hospital, their risk of contracting any disease increases by 10 to 30 percent," said Dr. Todd Nierenberg, chief of infectious diseases at the American University of Panama, who is also the microbiologist leading the research.\newline%
