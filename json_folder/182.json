Caspases, particularly caspase 3, are proteases\nthat are activated during apoptosis and which cleave substrates\nsuch as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, actin, fodrin, and lamin5,6.\nApoptosis is also accompanied by the internucleosomal degrada-\ntion of chromosomal DNA7\u20139. In the accompanying Article10,\nwe have identified and molecularly cloned a caspase-activated\ndeoxyribonuclease (CAD) and its inhibitor (ICAD). Here we show\nthat caspase 3 cleaves ICAD and inactivates its CAD-inhibitory\neffect. We identified two caspase-3 cleavage sites in ICAD by site-\ndirected mutagenesis. When human Jurkat cells were transformed\nwith ICAD-expressing plasmid, occupation of the receptor Fas,\nwhich normally triggers apoptosis, did not result in DNA degra-\ndation. The ICAD transformants were also resistant to stauro-\nsporine-induced DNA degradation, although staurosporine still\nkilled the cells by activating caspase. Our results indicate that\nactivation of CAD downstream of the caspase cascade is respon-\nsible for internucleosomal DNA degradation during apoptosis,\nand that ICAD works as an inhibitor of this process.\n\nWe have shown that the growing cells carry an inactive form of\nCAD and its inhibitor ICAD in the cytosol. Mouse ICAD purified\n\nfrom mouse WR19L cells is a protein of relative molecular mass\n(Mr) 32K, which can inhibit CAD-induced DNA degradation in\nnuclei as well as its DNase activity on plasmid DNA. In contrast to\ngrowing cells, lysates from Fas-activated apoptotic cells do not have\nICAD activity (data not shown), suggesting that ICAD could be\ninactivated by an apoptotic signal. A candidate in activator is\ncaspase 3, which is itself activated during apoptosis1,11\u201313. To test\nwhether ICAD is cleaved by caspase 3, we incubated ICAD purified\nfrom mouse WR19L cells with caspase 3. As shown in Fig. 1a,\ncaspase-3-treated ICAD could no longer inhibit CAD-induced\nDNA degradation in nuclei or its DNase activity on plasmid\nDNA; also, the 32K ICAD protein was specifically cleaved by caspase\n3 (Fig. 1b).\n\nMolecular cloning of ICAD complementary DNAs has indicated\nthat ICAD exists in two forms, ICAD-L for the long form and\nICAD-S for the short form10, which seem to be generated by\nalternative splicing. Both ICAD-L and ICAD-S carry two putative\n\nFigure 1 Inactivation of ICAD by caspase-3 cleavage. a, Native purified ICAD10\n\n(100 ng) was incubated with 15ng caspase 3 in buffer A (see Methods). Lysates\n\nfrom Fas-activated W4 cells (20 mg) (lanes 1\u20135) or caspase-3-activated, partially\n\npurified CAD (5ng) (lanes 6\u201310) were mixed with 25ng caspase-3-treated or\n\nuntreated ICAD. CAD activity was assayed with mouse nuclei (lanes 1\u20135) or with\n\nplasmid DNA (lanes 6\u201310) using CAD (lanes 2 and 7), CAD and ICAD (lanes 3 and\n\n8), CAD and caspase-3-treated ICAD (lanes 4 and 9), or caspase-3-treated ICAD\n\nalone (lanes 5 and 10). b, Purified ICAD (100ng) was treated with 15ng caspase 3,\n\nelectrophoresed ona 10\u201320% gradient polyacrylamidegel and visualizedbysilver\n\nstaining.

Caspase requires aspartic\nacid at the P1 position of the cleavage site14,15. To test whether\ncaspase 3 cleaves ICAD at these positions (Fig. 2a), the aspartic acid\nresidues at the cleavage sites were singly or doubly mutated to\nglutamic acid. Recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST)\nfusion protein for each ICAD mutant was produced in Escherichia\ncoli and purified to homogeneity. Treatment of wild-type ICAD-L\n(L/WT) with caspase 3 yielded two bands of Mr 40K and 12K\n(Fig. 2b). The upper band is a fusion protein consisting of GST and\nthe amino-terminal portion of ICAD, whereas the lower band is\nactually two bands derived from the middle and carboxy-terminal\nportions of ICAD. When Asp 117 was mutated (L/D117E), the\n\nupper band generated by caspase 3 shifted to an Mr of 52K, whereas\nmutation of Asp 224 (L/D224E) shifted the lower band to an Mr of\n26K. Furthermore, the double mutation at both sites (L/dm)\ngenerated an ICAD that was resistant to caspase 3. Similar results\nwere obtained with mutants of ICAD-S. We then assayed for\ninhibition by mutated ICAD of CAD-induced DNA degradation.\nLike native ICAD, caspase 3 treatment of recombinant ICAD\ndestroyed its inhibitory activity (Fig. 2c). ICADs carrying a single\nmutation at Asp 117 or double mutations at Asp 117 and 224 were\nstill functional after treatment with caspase 3. On the other hand,\nICAD, particularly ICAD-S, carrying the intact cleavage site at\nAsp 117 was sensitive to caspase 3. These results indicate that the\ncleavage of ICAD at Asp 117 by caspase 3 inactivates ICAD, and that\nmutation at Asp 117 can generate caspase-3-resistant ICAD.\n\nHuman Jurkat cells can be killed by agonistic anti-Fas antibody or\nby a high concentration of staurosporine, and in both cases cell\ndeath is accompanied by internucleosomal cleavage of chromo-\nsomal DNA16 (A. Kawahara and S.N., unpublished results). To\ninvestigate the effect of ICAD on DNA degradation during apop-\ntosis, wild-type ICAD-L and ICAD-S, as well as their caspase-3-\nresistant double mutants, were tagged with the Flag epitope and\ntheir expression plasmids introduced into Jurkat cells. The stable\ntransformant clones expressing ICAD were selected by western\nblotting using anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 3a). The expression of Fas\nin all transformant clones was the same as in parental cells (data not\nshown). When parental Jurkat cells were treated with anti-Fas\nantibody, their chromosomal DNA was degraded into 180-base-\npair (bp) multimers within 4 h (Fig. 3b). On the other hand,\ntransformants expressing wild-type ICAD-L or ICAD-S, or their\ncaspase-3-resistant mutants, did not show any DNA fragmentation,\neven after a 6-h incubation with anti-Fas antibody. Similarly, when\nJurkat cells were incubated with 10 mM staurosporine, their\nchromosomal DNA was degraded within 2 h; however, this degra-\ndation was completely inhibited by overexpression of wild-type\nICAD-L or ICAD-S. These results indicate that ICAD specifically\nblocks the DNase(s) that is activated during apoptosis.\n\nThe killing of cells by staurosporine was then followed by flow\ncytometry using annexin V17. As shown in Fig. 3c, most of the\nparental Jurkat cells, as well as the transformants expressing wild-\ntype ICAD-L or ICAD-S, became annexin-V-positive (indicative of\ncell death) within 2 h of treatment with staurosporine. When cell\ndeath was assayed by the MTT method, which determines the\nintegrity of mitochondria18, the results also indicated that the cells\n(parental Jurkat and ICAD transformants) treated with stauro-\nsporine died within 2 h (data not shown). This killing was accom-\npanied by the cleavage of 116K poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase to an\n85K protein (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, when caspase 3 activity in the\ncytosol was determined by using a fluorescent substrate, the activity\nin ICAD transformant cells after staurosporine treatment was\ncomparable to that in parental Jurkat cells (Fig. 3e). The anti-Fas\nantibody also killed the Jurkat and ICAD transformants by activat-\ning caspase 3, although the killing process was slow compared with\nthat induced by staurosporine (data not shown). These results\nindicate that the cell can die without DNA degradation, probably\nas a result of cleavage of various important cellular substrates by\ncaspases.\n\nWe have shown that ICAD can be inactivated by caspase 3 and\nthat overexpression of ICAD in human Jurkat cells blocks DNA\ndegradation during apoptosis. Mouse ICAD-L shares significant\nsequence similarity with one of the subunits of human DFF (DFF45,\nfor DNA-fragmentation factor 45)19 and seems to be the murine\ncounterpart of DFF45. Purified human DFF consists of 45K and 40K\nsubunits and causes DNA fragmentation in nuclei when treated\nwith caspase 3. This is also a property of the inactive CAD that we\nhave identified10. DFF itself does not have DNase activity, suggesting\nthat DFF is not human CAD. It has been proposed that when DFF45\nis cleaved by caspase 3, DFF enters the nucleus and activates a\n\nFigure 2 Identification of caspase 3 cleavage sites in ICAD.

In contrast, mouse CAD has an intrinsic DNase\nactivity, which ICAD inhibits by binding to it. These results may\nindicate that ICAD can bind not only CAD, but also another\nmolecule (DFF40) that regulates a DNase. The DNase regulated\nby DFF may be CAD or a CAD-like DNase because overexpression\nof ICAD inhibits DNA degradation in the apoptotic process in\nhuman cells.\n\nCaspase 3 inactivates ICAD by cleaving it. We originally thought\nthat CAD could be inhibited in cells only by caspase-resistant ICAD:\nhowever, overexpression of wild-type ICAD in Jurkat cells com-\npletely blocks DNA degradation induced by Fas engagement, as well\nas by staurosporine. These results suggest that an ICAD-inhibitable\nDNase is activated during apoptosis and that this activation can be\ntriggered by different stimuli. As ICAD inhibits CAD, but does not\ninhibit DNase I or II (ref. 10), we conclude that CAD or a CAD-like\nDNase is responsible for the DNA degradation that occurs in\napoptosis, at least in human Jurkat cells where apoptosis is induced\nby Fas or staurosporine. Most ICAD introduced into the cells is\nquickly degraded by these apoptotic stimuli (H.S. and S.N., unpub-\nlished results), indicating that a small amount of ICAD is sufficient\nto inhibit CAD activity, or that the concentration of CAD is\nminimal. Apoptosis can be induced in thymocytes by gluco-\ncorticoids9 and in various cells by factor or serum deprivation2. To\n\nassess the generality of CAD\u2019s involvement in apoptosis, it will be\nnecessary to study the effect of ICAD in other systems.\n\nStudies on programmed cell death in C. elegans have indicated\nthat DNase activity is not essential for cell killing20. One mouse cell\nline was killed by the action of cytotoxic lymphocytes without\napparent DNA fragmentation21. Here the transformants expressing\nICAD were killed by staurosporine treatment without cleavage of\nchromosomal DNA. Caspase was fully active under these con-\nditions, which places the apoptotic DNase downstream of the\ncaspases and indicates that cleavage of cellular substrates such as\nactin, Rho\u2013GDI and fodrin is sufficient to kill the cells5,6. In\naddition to cleavage of DNA, apoptotic stimuli induce the con-\ndensation and fragmentation of nuclei3. It is not yet clear whether\nit is DNA degradation or cleavage of nuclear proteins such as\npoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamin that is responsible for\nthe morphological changes in cells4,22,23: cells that carry a fully\nactivated caspase and do not suffer DNA degradation will clarify\nthis point. Finally, it has been proposed that degradation of\nchromosomal DNA is involved in the cleaning up of dead cells, by\nfacilitating phagocytosis or by preventing transformation of the\nphagocytosing cells by intact DNA from the dying cells22. The genes\nencoding CAD and ICAD will be useful for addressing these\nquestions. M\n\nFigure 3 Killing of Jurkat cells without DNA fragmentation.

Purification of ICAD from\nmouse WR19L cells has been described10. The final preparation (active fractions\nfrom the Superdex-200 gel-filtration column) was heated at 90 8C for 15 min\nand centrifuged at 100,000g for 30 min; the supernatant was used as purified\nICAD.

The wild-type and mutant cDNAs were fused to the GST gene\nof pGEX-2T[128/129]. pGEX-2T[128/129] is derived from pGEX-2T (Phar-\nmacia) by in-frame insertion of the Flag-epitope tag and a heart-muscle kinase-\nrecognition sequence following the GST gene25. The fusion proteins were\nexpressed in E. coli AD202, and purified by glutathione\u2013Sepharose-4B (Phar-\nmacia) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Recombinant ICAD\neluted from the glutathione column was purified on a Mono-Q HR5/5\ncolumn with a NaCl gradient in buffer A containing 0.02% Tween-20.\nTransformation of Jurkat cells, cell-death assay and western blotting.\n\nWild-type ICAD-S and ICAD-L and their double mutants were tagged with the\nFlag epitope at their N termini and ligated into the pEF-BOS vector26. Human\nJurkat cells were co-transfected with ICAD expression plasmids and pBLIIhyg\nby electroporation27. Hygromycin B(800 mg ml\u22121)-resistant transformants were\npicked and expanded. Expression of ICAD in individual clones was analysed\nby western blotting with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (clone M2, Kodak).\nTo bring about apoptosis, Jurkat and ICAD-transformant cells (2:5 3 105 cells\nper ml) were incubated at 37 8C with 0.5 mg ml\u22121 of mouse anti-human\nFas monoclonal antibody (clone CH11, MBL) or 10 mM staurosporine. Cell\ndeath was assayed by using the annexin V method17 (R & D System kit). DNA\nfragmentation was assayed as described27. Proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose)\npolymerase was determined by western blotting using a mouse monoclonal\nantibody against human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (clone C-2-10)28. To\ndetermine cytosolic caspase 3 activity, a peptide (DEVDAPK) carrying the\ncaspase-3-recognition sequence was coupled to the highly fluorescent (7-\nmethoxycoumarin-4-yl) acetyl group (MCA) and its quenching 2,4-dinitro-\nphenyl (Dnp) group, and the product MCA-DEVDAPK(dnp) used as a\nsubstrate as described11.\n\nReceived 20 November; accepted 1 December 1997.\n\n1.

Here we report a previously undetected activity of RNase E:\nthe ability to shorten 39 poly(A)- and poly(U)-homopolymer tails\non RNA molecules. This activity, which leaves a 6-nucleotide\nadenylate or a 1-nucleotide uridylate remnant on primary tran-\nscripts, resides in the amino-terminal region of RNase E and does\nnot require other protein cofactors. Addition of a 39-terminal\nphosphate group prevents both removal of the poly(A) tail and\nendonucleolytic cleavage within primary transcripts, but has no\neffect on the cleavage of transcripts with tails that have already\nbeen truncated. The ability of RNase E to shorten poly(A) tails,\ntogether with the effect of tail length on endonucleolytic cleavage\nwithin primary transcripts, suggests a mechanism by which\nRNase E may exercise overall control over RNA decay.\n\nDuring our investigation of RNase E cleavage of 39 polyadeny-\nlated RNAI, the antisense repressor of replication of ColE1-type\nplasmids4,5, we observed that poly(A) tails were dramatically shor-\ntened under assay conditions in which polynucleotide phosphory-\nlase (PNPase) and RNase II\u2014the two E. coli enzymes that have 39-\nto-59 exonucleolytic activity1,2,6\u20139\u2014were not expected to function.\nTo investigate this observation, histidine-tagged full-length RNase E\nand its N-terminal endoribonucleolytic domain (N-Rne) were\noverexpressed in E. coli and affinity-purified. The N-Rne polypep-\ntide, which contains the first 498 amino acids of the 1,061-amino-\nacid protein10 but lacks the PNPase binding site at the C-terminal\nend of RNase E11, was further purified to homogeneity by elution\nfrom preparative SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gels, followed by renaturation\n\n\n\nCORRECTIONS & AMENDMENTS\n\nCORRIGENDUM\ndoi:10.1038/nature15532\n\nCorrigendum: Cleavage of CAD\ninhibitor in CAD activation and\nDNA degradation during apoptosis\nHideki Sakahira, Masato Enari & Shigekazu Nagata\n\nNature 391, 96\u201399 (1998); doi:10.1038/34214\n\nRecently, it has come to our attention that in Fig. 1a of this Letter,\nlanes 1 and 5 appear to be duplicated and lanes 6 and 10 appear to be\nduplicated.
