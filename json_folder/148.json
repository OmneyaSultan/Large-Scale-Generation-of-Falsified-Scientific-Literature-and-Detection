We generated monoclonal antibodies\n(mAbs) that exclusively bind, at concentrations ranging from 2 to 100 mg/ml, to a modified CD44 variant (designated CD44vRA) expressed on\nsynovial fluid cells from joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. These mAbs cross-reacted with keratinocytes expressing wild type\nCD44vRA (CD44v3ev10) only at a relatively high concentration (200 mg/ml). Sequence analysis of CD44vRA cDNA revealed, in 33 out of\n43 RA and psoriatic arthritis patients, an extra intron-derived trinucleotide, CAG, which allows translation of an extra alanine. This insertion\nimposes a configurational change on the cell surface CD44 of RA synovial fluid cells, creating an immunogenic epitope and potentiating the\nability to produce disease-specific antibodies. Indeed, the anti-CD44vRA mAbs (designated F8:33) were able to induce apoptosis in synovial\nfluid cells from RA patients, but not in peripheral blood leukocytes from the same patients, in keratinocytes from normal donors or in synovial\nfluid cells from osteoarthritis patients. Furthermore, injection of anti-CD44vRA mAbs reduced joint inflammation in DBA/1 mice with collagen-\ninduced arthritis. These findings show that anti-CD44vRA mAbs are both bioactive and RA-specific.\n\ufffd 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of drugs or technologies\ncapable of targeting cells involved in pathological activities,\nwhile leaving the normal cells intact and functioning, would\nbe a stunning victory for medical science.\n\nOne way to cope with this challenge is to screen cancer or\ninflammatory cells for cell surface structural entities expressed\non the cells engaged in pathological functions, but not on\n\nmailto:naord@md.huji.ac.il\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/jautimm\n\n\n100 I.

Specific tar-\ngeting agents (e.g., antibodies or competitive peptides) recog-\nnizing such hypothetical structures or their counter molecules,\nshould selectively neutralize the cells implicated in patholog-\nical functions, with minimal side effects. Although in the past\nthree decades efforts have been made to identify such disease-\nspecific cell surface entities, the results are disappointing,\nespecially from the patient\u2019s view.\n\nThe targeting of CD44 molecule and its ligand provides,\nhowever, new opportunities in establishing specific therapies\nfor cancer and inflammatory diseases. CD44 is a cell surface\nglycoprotein involved in many vital normal bioactivities, in-\ncluding interaction between cells and extracellular tissues,\nsupport of cell migration in the blood vessels and inside the\ntissues, presentation of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines\nand enzymes to other cells or to the surrounding tissues, as\nwell as signal transmission from the cell surface to the interior\nof the cell, leading to programmed cell death or cell survival\nand proliferation [1,2]. While hyaluronic acid (HA) is the prin-\ncipal ligand of CD44, this receptor can interact with many\nother cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) components\n[1e3]. Cells involved in pathological activities use CD44 to\nmaintain at least some of the above-mentioned functions, but\nwith destructive outcomes. For example, in a normal setting,\ncell surface CD44 supports the migration of inflammatory\ncells from the blood circulation toward sites of bacterial infec-\ntion [4], resulting in the killing of the bacteria. Under patho-\nlogical conditions, CD44 can support the migration of\nmetastatic cells from the site of the primary tumor growth to\nremote organs or the migration of auto-destructive inflamma-\ntory cells to potential sites of inflammation [1,5]. We and\nothers have shown in animal models that monoclonal anti-\nbodies (mAbs) against CD44 can markedly reduce the patho-\nlogical activities of malignant lymphoma [6], juvenile diabetes\n[5], collagen-induced arthritis [7,8], experimental colitis [9]\nand experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (analogous to hu-\nman multiple sclerosis) [10], possibly by interfering with cell\nmigration or inducing apoptosis in the target cells. However,\nsuch anti-CD44 mAbs can simultaneously target normal cells\nexpressing CD44, causing damage to essential biological\nfunctions.\n\nCD44, however, is not a single molecule. The genomic\nstructure of CD44 includes five constant exons at the 50 end,\nfive (or four) constant exons at the 30 end and 10 (mouse) or\n9 (man) variant exons inserted between the two constant exons\n(Fig. 1A). Alternative splicing, can theoretically generate by\ndifferential utilization of the 10 (or 9) variant exons over\n800 isoforms [11], of them a few dozen have been already dis-\ncovered. Direct splicing of constant exon 5 to constant exon 16\n(Fig. 1A), skipping the entire variable region, generates the\nmost ubiquitous isoform-standard CD44 (CD44s), predomi-\nnantly expressed on hematopoietic cells [3]. Modifications in\nthe alternative splicing regulation, either genetically inherited,\nor induced, for example, in the stressed pathological site, may\nfurther enrich the molecular diversity of CD44 by giving rise\nto CD44 variants (CD44v) with extra sequences illegitimately\ntranscribed from the end of an intron adjacent to junction sites\nof the alternative splicing [12]. Such a mechanism may gener-\nate exclusive CD44 variants expressed on cells engaged in\npathological activities, i.e., disease-specific CD44 molecules.\nThe present communication describes disease-specific CD44\nvariant expressed on synovial fluid cells of rheumatoid arthri-\ntis patients (designated CD44vRA). The inclusion of extra tri-\nnucleotide in CD44vRA allows translation of an extra alanine,\nresulting in the generation of novel immunogenic epitope,\nwhich enabled the production of functional anti-CD44vRA\nmAb. This anti-CD44vRA mAb can induce apoptosis in syno-\nvial fluid cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, but not\nin peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) from the same patients.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Patients\n\nFifty-five patients (30e75 years old) were included in our\nstudy, of them 35 with RA, eight with psoriatic arthritis\n(PSA) and 12 with osteoarthritis (OA). The patients had\nbeen diagnosed with RA, PSA or OA according to the Amer-\nican College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients treated\nwith anti-TNFa reagents were excluded from this study. All\npatients in this study underwent an arthrocentesis of the joint,\nowing to acute synovitis. Institutional ethics committee\napproval and written informed consent were obtained before\nany protocol specific procedures were undertaken.\n\n2.2. Cloning and transfection of human CD44vRA,\nCD44v3ev10 and CD44s\n\nFor cloning human CD44vRA cDNA, the total synovial\nfluid cell population of RA patients undergoing joint aspiration\nwas isolated. RNA was separated with a commercial kit\n(Promega, Madison, WI), CD44vRA cDNA was prepared by\nRT-PCR (PTC-100\ufffd Programmable Thermal Controller; MJ\nResearch, Watertown, MA), using primers representing the\nconstant coding regions of CD44 (see Fig. 1A): Ex1-sense,\n50-GAATTCGCCGCCACCATGGACAAGTTTTGGTGG-30;\nEx20-antisense, 50-TCTAGATTACACCCCAATCTTCATG-30.\n\nPCR product size was confirmed by agarose gel electro-\nphoresis, sequencing (ABI PRISM 310, Perkin-Elmer, Well-\nesley, MA) or PstI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA)\ndigestion (the nucleotide insertion in CD44vRA introduces\na PstI digestion site). The PCR product was excised from\nthe gel, purified and subcloned into the pGEM vector (Prom-\nega). Positive clones were selected by white/blue screening.\nPlasmids were purified with a commercial kit (Promega),\nsubjected in EcoRI/Xbal-double digestion and cloned into\nthe pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in which\nthe gene product was expressed. The plasmid was transfected\ninto the CD44-negative Namalwa Burkett lymphoma cell line\n(ATCC, Manassas, VA) as described [13]. For cloning of\nhuman CD44v3ev10, RNA was isolated from human kerati-\nnocytes (a gift from Dr. Ben-Basat, Hadassah University\nHospital, Jerusalem), and for cloning of human CD44s,\nRNA was isolated from the HeLa cervical cancer cell line\n\n\n\n101I.

The white squares represent the\n\nvariant exons (designated v2, v3, etc.) subjected to alternative splicing. Differential utilization of the variant exons generates the different CD44 isoforms, e.g.,\n\nutilization of exons v3ev10 in tandem forms the CD44v3ev10. Note that exon v1 is not included in human CD44. Arrows mark the positions and directions\n\nof exon 1 sense and exon 20 antisense primers used to isolate the CD44 transcripts, as well as the hs50, hs 30 and pv3I primers (for sequence, see Section 2)\nused in the RT-PCR described in B. (B) RT-PCR analysis of synovial fluid cells from RA patients. RT-PCR of total RNA derived from synovial fluid cells of\n\nsix RA patients and keratinocytes from one donor (marked with K). Primers hs50/hs30 were used to detect the CD44s transcripts (571 bp). The faint signals at\n1714 bp represent the CD44v3ev10 transcripts, which are dominated by CD44s transcripts. To see the CD44v3ev10 transcripts (1111 bp) more clearly we\n\nused the pv3I/hs30 primers (see A). N-positive control: Namalwa cells expressing CD44vRA.

(C) The entire nucleotide and amino acid sequences of CD44vRA exons v4 and v5 with alignment to the corresponding\n\nCD44v3ev10 wild type sequences derived from normal human primary keratinocytes. CAG and alanine inclusion in CD44vRA sequence are shown in bold letters.\n(obtained from ATCC), using the above-described protocol.\nTransfection of CD44vRA, CD44v3ev10 and CD44s cDNAs\nas well as of the pcDNA3.1 vector (\u2018\u2018empty vector\u2019\u2019) was\nperformed as described above. Accordingly, the transfected\nNamalwa cells were designated Namalwa-CD44vRA,\nNamalwa-CD44v3ev10, Namalwa-CD44s and Namalwa-Neo,\nrespectively.\n\n2.3. Preparation of soluble hCD44v3ev10,\nhCD44vRA and hCD44s plasmids\n\nThe soluble CD44v3ev10 cDNA was cloned from total\nRNA of primary human keratinocyte by RT-PCR amplifica-\ntion, using two primers assigned from the published CD44 se-\nquence: Ex1s, 50-TATCTAGAGCCGCCACCATGGACAAGT\nTTTGGTGG-30; Ex16/17as, 50-TATCTAGAGCCATTCTGGA\nATTTGGGGTGT-30.\nBoth primers contained a Xbal recognition site. The PCR\nproducts were digested with Xbal enzyme and pCXFc zeovec-\ntor was digested with NheI enzyme. After digestion, the PCR\nproducts were ligated into the pCXFc zeovector to generate\nCD44v3ev10-immunoglobulin (Ig)-Fc recombinant. Using\nthe same protocol, the soluble CD44vRA and soluble CD44s\ncDNAs were cloned from synovial cells of a rheumatoid ar-\nthritis patient. The soluble CD44 fragments were assigned\nfrom the published sequence of CD44 (1e1824 bases) [14].\n\n2.4. Transient transfection of the soluble CD44\nplasmids into 293T cells\n\nA quantity of 3 mg of each one of the above-indicated Fc\ncontaining plasmids was incubated for 20 min with 12 ml of\nFuGene 6 (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The\nmixture was added into 15 cm cell plates containing 70%\n\n\n\n102 I. Golan et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 28 (2007) 99e113\nconfluent of 293T cells. Supernatant was collected after 48 h\nand 72 h. The CD44-IgFc fragmented proteoglycans were\npurified on protein-G column and analyzed for correctness\nby SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibody recognizing\na constant epitope shared by all CD44 isoforms, designated\nanti-pan-CD44 (or anti-CD44s) mAb (Hermes-3 derived\nfrom American Type Culture Collection, ATCC).\n\n2.5. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR)\n\nRNA was extracted from synovial fluid cells of RA patients,\nprimary human keratinocytes or Namalwa-CD44vRA cells,\nusing RNA-BEE reagent (RNA isolation solvent, Tel-Test,\nFriendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions. Reverse transcription was performed with 5 units of\nAMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a 20 ml reaction vol-\nume containing 50 mM TriseHCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCL,\n10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 20 units\nRNasin (Promega), using 500 ng of RNA and 100 ng of oligo\nd(T)18 primer (Promega). Reaction samples were incubated\nfor 1 h at 41 \ufffdC and then the reverse transcriptase was\ninactivated by heating the mixture for 10 min at 65 \ufffdC. The\namplification was performed in a micro-processor-controlled\nincubator (MiniCycler\ufffd, MJ Research), using 0.5 ml of the\nreverse transcriptase reaction product (cDNA) in a final volume\nof 50 ml containing 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM\nTriseHCl, pH 9.0, 250 mM dNTPs and 2.5 units Taq DNA\npolymerase (Promega). The following primers (see Fig. 1A)\nwere added to reaction mixture: hs 50 sense, 50-GATGGA-\nGAAAGCTCTGAGCATC-30; pv3I sense, 50-ACGTCTTCAA\nATACCATCTC-30; hs 30 antisense, 50-TTTGCTCCACCTTCT\nTGACTCC-30.\n\nThe CD44 amplification was carried out for 30 cycles with\ndenaturation at 94 \ufffdC for 1 min, annealing at 50 \ufffdC for 1 min\nand extension at 72 \ufffdC for 2 min, followed by 10 min final ex-\ntension at 72 \ufffdC. The amplified products were resolved on\n1.5% agarose gel. Determination of the cellular CD44 isoform\ntranscripts was based on the position of the bend in relation to\nthe markers\u2019 ladder, and on the expected bp size of the differ-\nent CD44 variants.\n\n2.6. Generation of monoclonal antibody\nsecreting hybridomas\n\nThirty mer CD44vRA peptide (SNPEVLLQTTTRM-\nTANPSHSNPEVLLOTTT) obtained from Corixa (Seattle,\nWA) and/or 100 mg/ml soluble CD44vRA produced in our lab-\noratory, both emulsified in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA)\n(Sigma, St. Louis, MD), were used to immunize subcutane-\nously or intramuscularly 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice.\nThe immunization was repeated on days 14 and 28 and 2\nweeks later the mice were bled and their sera were tested by\nflow cytometry for their ability to bind to Namalwa cells\nexpressing CD44. The animals with highest polyclonal anti-\nCD44 antibody titers were selected and boosted intraperitone-\nally (i.p.) with 108 Namalwa-CD44vRA cells. After 72 h,\nspleen cells were harvested and fused with SP 2/0 myeloma\ncells according to Kohler and Milstein [15]. After 1 day of in-\ncubation in enriched RPMI 1640 (Sigma) containing L-gluta-\nmine, PeneStrep solution, sodium pyruvate and MEM-Eagle\nnon-essential amino acids (Biological Industries, Bet-Haemek,\nIsrael) and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) the hybrid-\nomas were grown in ClonaCell\ufffd-HY Hybridoma Selection\nMedium (medium D, StemCell Technologies, Vancouver,\nBC). Between days 10e14, separated hybridoma colonies\nwere collected from the semi-solid agar and grown in 96-\nwell plates (Costar, Milpitas, CA) in enriched RPMI 1640 me-\ndium containing HAT media supplement (Sigma) and 20% of\nFBS. At day 7, the supernatants from isolated hybridoma\nclones were screened by flow cytometry for their ability to\nbind to Namalwa-Neo, Namalwa-CD44v3ev10 or Namalwa-\nCD44vRA cells. Hybridoma whose supernatants bound selec-\ntively or preferentially to Namalwa-CD44vRA were cloned by\nlimiting dilution and then recloned for additional three cycles.\nThe isolated hybridoma was maintained in enriched RPMI\n1640 containing HAT media supplement and 20% FBS. The\nisotype of the CD44vRA-positive hybridoma supernatant\nwas determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) using Clonotype System-HRP (Southern Biotechnol-\nogy Associates, Birmingham, Alabama). Monoclonal anti-\nbodies were partially purified from hybridoma supernatants,\nusing G-protein column.\n\n2.7. Flow cytometry analysis\n\nA quantity of 106 cells were incubated with 3G5 anti-\npan-CD44s (Hermes 3, IgG1; ATCC) F-10-44-2 anti-pan-CD44\n(known also as anti-CD44s) mAb (IgG2b, Serotec, Oxford,\nUK), VFF7 anti-CD44v6 mAb (IgG1, Bender MedSystem,\nVienna, Austria), anti-CD44v9 mAb (ATCC) or anti-CD44vRA\nfor 45 min on ice. After extensive washing, the cells were incu-\nbated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated second-\nary anti-Ig antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA)\nfor 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed and analyzed with\na Flow Cytometry (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).\n\n2.8. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n\nPolystyrene plates of 96 wells (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark)\nwere coated with purified CD44vRA-IgFc, CD44v3ev10-\nIgFc, CD44s-IgFc soluble proteins or with BSA (100 mg/ml/\nwell diluted in 100 ml sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0). After\novernight incubation at 4 \ufffdC, the plate was washed three times\nwith phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing\n0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/T). Following blocking with 10%\nmilk in PBS at 37 \ufffdC for 2 h, different concentrations of\nF8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb or anti-pan-CD44 (Hermes 3)\nmAb were added to the wells. The plates were incubated at\n37 \ufffdC for 1 h, washed and a secondary goat anti-mouse poly-\nvalent peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoRe-\nsearch, Palo-Alto, CA) was added for an additional 1 h. The\nenzyme reaction was developed with 0.04% H2O2 and\n0.04% o-phenylenediamine in phosphateecitrate buffer, pH\n\n\n\n103I. Golan et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 28 (2007) 99e113\n5.0 and stopped after 20 min by addition of 25 ml 4N H2SO4.\nThe optical density (OD) was measured at 405 nm on a micro-\nplate reader MRX (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) and\nvalues above 0.1 OD were considered positive.\n\n2.9. Western blot analysis\n\nCells were lyzed in NP-40 buffer and 100 mg of protein, run\non denaturing SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF mem-\nbrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked with\n1% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T), and in-\ncubated for 1 h with 1 mg/ml Hermes-3 anti-pan-CD44 mAb,\nwhich was obtained from ATCC hybridoma supernatant and\npurified on a protein-G column. The blots were rewashed in\nPBS-T, incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated anti-\nIg secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) (Jackson Immuno-\nResearch) for 45 min, rewashed in PBS-T and developed\nwith ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire,\nUK).\n\n2.10. Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis\n\nApoptosis was induced by culturing 2\ufffd 106 synovial fluid\ncells from RA patients with different concentrations of anti-\nCD44vRA mAb or with commercial anti-pan-CD44 mAb di-\nluted in the serum-free RPMI 1640 for 16 h at 37 \ufffdC in CO2\nincubator. Synovial fluid cells incubated with 5 mg/ml doxoru-\nbicin served as a positive control. Peripheral blood leukocytes\n(PBLs) from the same patients, as well as from synovial fluid\ncells from OA patients underwent identical treatment with an-\ntibody. After the antibody treatment the cells were washed\nonce in PBS and resuspended in 100 ml of annexin V binding\nbuffer (Pharminogen, San Diego, CA). Five microliters of fluo-\nrescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V (Pharmi-\ngen) and 5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) were added to the\ncells. The cells were mixed gently and incubated for 15 min at\nroom temperature in the dark, then diluted with 400 ml binding\nbuffer and analyzed by two color flow cytometry (Becton\nDickinson Inc, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Apoptotic cells were dis-\ntinguished from normal cells by labeling with annexin V and\ninclusion of propidium iodide. Events accumulated in the\nlower right hand side quadrate of the panel represent cells in\nearly apoptosis, those accumulated in the upper right hand\nside quadrate represent cells in late apoptosis, and those at\nthe lower left hand side quadrate represent survived cells.\n\n2.11. Collagen-induced arthritis\n\nGeneration of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice and\nassessment of inflammation by measuring footpad swelling\nwere performed as we described previously [7]. Briefly,\nType II collagen was injected twice 3 weeks apart, into\nDBA/1 mice. The development of joint inflammation was as-\nsessed by measuring footpad swelling with a micro-caliper in\nmice marked by numbers, decoded only at the end of the ex-\nperiment, and then assigned to the different groups. Anti-\nCD44 antibodies (150 mg/injection) were injected at onset of\ndisease (when the footpad swelling measurement was\n>1.7 mm) and then every other day for 12 days. This protocol\nwas approved by the institute\u2019s Animal Ethics Committee.\n\n2.12. Statistical analysis\n\nData were analyzed using microcomputer programs for\none-way ANOVA, followed by Student\u2019s t-test for unpaired\nvalues. P< 0.05 was considered significant. The results are\nexpressed as the mean\ufffd s.e.m. Each experiment was repeated\nat least three times, all showing similar results.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. The mRNA of CD44 expressed on synovial fluid cells\nof RA patients contains intron-derived extra trinucleotide\n\nSynovial fluid cells from RA patients (comprising approx-\nimately 70% polymorphonuclears and macrophages; the\nremaining are T and B lymphocytes, Ref. [12]) were isolated\nfollowing joint aspiration. Their total RNA was reversed\ntranscribed and subjected to PCR, using primers representing\nthe constant coding regions of CD44 (hs 50 and hs 30 in\nFig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows the RT-PCR of samples from synovial\nfluid cells derived from the joint of six representative RA pa-\ntients. Two major signals were detected: a fast-migrating band\n(571 bp) corresponds to CD44s, and a slow-migrating band\n(1714 bp) corresponds to CD44v3ev10, which is also ex-\npressed on keratinocytes (Fig. 1B). As the 1714 bp bands are\nfaint (they are dominated by the CD44s transcripts), we in-\ncluded in the RT-PCR a third primer (pv 3I in Fig. 1A), repre-\nsenting a coding region from v3 variant exon, coupled to the\nantisense constant region primer (hs 30). The 1111 bp bands\nrepresent the CD44v3ev10 transcripts (Fig. 1B). These find-\nings were confirmed by direct sequencing (not shown).\n\nThe CD44 variant (CD44vRA or CD44v3ev10) was de-\ntected in samples of synovial fluid cells derived from all 35\nRA and eight PSA patients, who were included in the project.\nFive of 12 samples from synovial fluid cells of OA patients dis-\nplayed the CD44v3ev10 variant. Extra trinucleotide (CAG)\nwas detected between exon v4 and exon v5 (Fig. 1) in 27 of\n35 RA patients and 6 of 8 PSA patients following computerized\nalignment versus the wild type variant-CD44v3ev10 described\nin Ref. [14] (reported in Ref. [12] and confirmed in Fig. 1C).\nThe wild type variant, CD44v3ev10, was detected in synovial\nfluid cells of the remainder patients, i.e. 8 of 35 RA patients and\n2 of 8 PSA patients. The CAG trinucleotide was transcribed\nfrom the extreme end of the intron bridging exon v4 to exon\nv5, precisely at the splicing junction. This trinucleotide allows\nthe translation of alanine without interfering with the reading\nframe of CD44 transcript. Rheumatoid arthritis-derived\nCD44v3ev10 with extra CAG was designated CD44vRA.\n\n3.2. Production of anti-CD44vRA mAb\n\nExpression of extra alanine in CD44vRA may induce the\ninclusion of a novel immunogenic epitope, allowing the\n\n\n\n104 I. Golan et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 28 (2007) 99e113\ngeneration of mAbs able to discriminate between the RA vari-\nant and the wild type isoform-CD44v3ev10 expressed on ker-\natinocytes. CD44vRA, CD44v3ev10 (derived from human\nkeratinocytes) and CD44s (derived from HeLa cells) cDNAs\nwere transfected into CD44-negative Namalwa Burkitt lym-\nphoma cell line. CD44 transfectants expressing high levels of\nCD44s, as well as CD44v3ev10 and CD44vRA transfectants\nexpressing equal levels of v6-containing CD44 were selected\n(Fig. 2A). They were designated Namalwa-CD44s, Namalwa-\nCD44v3ev10 and Namalwa-CD44vRA, respectively. Na-\nmalwa cells transfected with the empty vector were designated\nNamalwa-pcDNA3.1 or Namalwa-Neo. C57BL/6 mice were\nimmunized with synthetic peptide or soluble CD44vRA, both\nincorporated into CFA and challenged with Namalwa-\nCD44vRA cells (for details, see Section 2). Splenocytes from\nmice showing the highest concentration of polyclonal anti-\nCD44v antibodies in their serum were fused with SP 2/0 mye-\nloma cells. Hybridoma cell clones were selected according to\nthe ability of their supernatants to bind to Namalwa-CD44vRA,\nbut not or much less, to Namalwa-CD44v3ev10, Namalwa-\nCD44s or to Namalwa-Neo, as indicated by flow cytometry.\nClones and subclones were established from a positive hybrid-\noma, and they were stable in culture for over 8 months.

Golan et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 28 (2007) 99e113\ndesignated F8:33 or MFI-16-11, were purified on G-protein col-\numn. Flow cytometry further revealed that at concentrations of\n0.2 mg/ml or 0.4 mg/ml (Fig. 2B, Table 1), F8:33 anti-CD44vRA\nmAb interacts with Namalwa-CD44vRA, but not with the other\ntransfectants, including Namalwa cells transfected with the wild\ntype CD44v3ev10 cDNA. At a concentration of 2 mg/ml or higher\nF8:33 cross-reacts with Namalwa-CD44v3ev10 (Table 1) and\nat higher concentrations (>100 mg/ml) e with Namalwa-CD44s\nand Namalwa-Neo cells as well (not shown). Isotype-matched\ncontrol antibody did not interact, at these concentrations, with\nthe Namalwa transfectants (not shown). This finding was con-\nfirmed by ELISA: F8:33 mAb bound, in a dose-dependent man-\nner, to CD44vRA-coated microwells at higher rates than to\nCD44v3ev10 or CD44s-coated microwells (Fig. 3A). In contrast,\nanti-pan-CD44 mAb similarly binds to CD44vRA and CD44v3e\nv10 (Fig. 3B), while it does not bind to CD44s, presumably due to\nits inability to recognize the relevant epitope. The molecular\nmasses of the soluble CD44 proteins were confirmed by Western\nblot (Fig. 3C). The isotype of F8:33 is IgG2a, as determined by\nELISA.\n\n3.3. Exclusive targeting of RA synovial fluid cells by\nF8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb\n\nThe Namalwa transfectants are not, however, the authentic\ntargets for F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb. Rather, the cells donat-\ning the transfected CD44vRA and CD44v3ev10 transcripts,\ni.e., synovial fluid cells and keratinocytes, respectively, should\nbe tested for their ability to interact with this antibody.\nFlow cytometry analysis revealed slightly higher expression\nof CD44s on synovial fluid cells of an RA patient than on\nkeratinocytes derived from two donors, with variations in\nexpression of v6-containing CD44. Note that keratinocytes ex-\npressing v9-containing CD44 (which is included in CD44v3e\nv10) at much higher level than RA synovial fluid cells\n(Fig. 4A). However, at even as wide a range of concentrations\nas 2e100 mg/ml, F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb interacts with sy-\nnovial fluid cells from RA patients (Fig. 4B and Table 1), but\nneither with keratinocytes (Fig. 4B and Table 1) nor or hardly\nwith synovial fluid cells from OA patients (Fig. 5 and Table 1),\nas indicated by flow cytometry. Even at as high a concentration\nas 100 mg/ml F8:33 selectively bound to RA synovial fluid\ncells, whereas at a concentration of 200 mg/ml F8:33 cross-\nreacts with keratinocytes and synovial fluid cells from OA\npatients (Table 1). Note that the synovial fluid cells were iden-\ntified as CD44vRA-positive cells by Pstl digestion of their\nDNA. Keratinocytes constitutively express CD44v3ev10 (3\nand our own observations). Next we found that anti-CD44vRA\nmAbs from two different clones (F8:33 and MFI-16-11)\nbound, at a concentration of z10 mg/ml, to synovial fluid cells\nfrom an RA patient, but they only marginally bound to PBL\nfrom the same patient or to synovial fluid cells from an OA pa-\ntient (Fig. 6). Anti-pan-hCD44 mAb (Hermes 3) bound to all\nthree types of cells and anti-hCD44v6 mAb (recognizing\nCD44 containing v6 epitope), bound exclusively to synovial\nfluid cells of OA patients (Fig. 6), emphasizing the specificity\nof F8:33 and MFi-16-11 binding.\n\n3.4. Anti-CD44vRA mAb induces apoptosis in synovial\nfluid cells of RA patients\n\nDoes the exclusive binding of anti-CD44vRA mAbs deliver\nany biological signal into synovial fluid cells of RA patients?\nTo challenge this question, we analyzed by two-dimensional\nflow cytometry the ability of F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb to in-\nduce apoptosis in synovial fluid cells and PBLs of RA patients.\nIncreasing the dose of F8:33 anti-CD44vRA, gradually in-\ncreased the apoptosis in synovial fluid cells of RA patients, but\nnot in the PBL of the same patients, as indicated by flow cytom-\netry double staining with annexin v and propidium iodide in\nsamples of one patient (Fig. 7A) and by graphical description\nof such a double staining analysis in samples of a different\npatient (Fig. 7B). Note that the level of apoptosis differs\nfrom one patient to another, and that the anti-pan-hCD44\nmAb (Hermes 3) induces apoptosis in synovial fluid cells of\nRA patients at the highest concentrations only (Fig. 7).

Analysis of F8:33 anti-CD44 mAb by ELISA. F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb (A) and anti-pan-CD44 mAb (Hermes-3) (B) were tested for their ability to bind\n\nto microwells coated with soluble CD44vRA, CD44v3ev10, CD44s and CD44-Neo. The binding was detected by a colorimetric assay at optical density of\n\n405 nm. (C) Western blot analysis of CD44s-Fc, CD44v3ev10-Fc and CD44vRA-Fc confirms the molecular mass of these soluble proteins.\nresults were detected in samples of at least additional 30 pa-\ntients. While increasing the doses of F8:33 anti-CD44 mAb\n(but not anti-pan-hCD44 mAb) gradually enhanced the apopto-\nsis in synovial fluid cells of a still another patient (Fig. 8A), the\nsame antibody failed to enhance, or enhanced less significantly,\napoptosis in synovial fluid cells of two OA patients (Fig. 8B),\nfurther stressing the specific apoptotic effect of F8:33. Note\nthat the synovial fluid cells of the patients depicted in Fig. 8\ndisplay relatively high levels of spontaneous apoptosis.\n\n3.5. Injection of anti-CD44vRA mAbs attenuates\ncollagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1 mice\n\nAlthough the anti-CD44vRA mAbs are human-not mouse-\nspecific and despite the fact that we did not detect CD44vRA\nin the joints of arthritic DBA/1 mice, we decided to verify the\nability of F8:33 and MF1-16-11 anti-human CD44vRA mAbs\nto reduce joint inflammation in DBA/1 mice displaying\ncollagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Such mice were named\nalso arthritic mice. We were prompted to perform this in\nvivo experiment, because anti-human F8:33 bound to spleen\ncells of arthritic mice, significantly increasing apoptosis above\nthe spontaneous level. In contrast, this antibody failed to bind\nto and increase apoptosis in spleen cells from normal mice (re-\nsults not shown). In this context it should be stressed that\nspleen cells from arthritic mice express both CD44s and\nCD44v3ev10, whereas spleen cells from normal mice express\nCD44s only. First, we confirmed our previous finding [7,8]\nshowing that injection of KM81 anti-mouse pan-CD44 mAb\nat the onset of CIA and then every other day for 12 days, re-\nduced joint inflammation versus that of similarly treated mice\nadministered isotype-matched control antibody. Interestingly,\ninjection, under the same experimental protocol, of F8:33 or\nMFI-16-11 anti-human CD44vRA mAbs reduced also joint in-\nflammation in the arthritic mice, albeit slightly less effectively\n(Fig. 9).

The\nCAG-containing splicing junction may be particularly sus-\nceptible to such changes, resulting in the inclusion of CAG\nin the CD44 mRNA sequence of RA patients. It should be\nmentioned that mutations located in non-coding regions,\nsuch as those affecting 50 and 30 splice sites, branch sites\nor polyadenylation signals, are frequently (w15%) the cause\nof genetic diseases [17].\n\nThe inclusion of CAG in the CD44 mRNA allows insertion\nof alanine into the translated cell surface CD44 glycoprotein\nwithout interfering with the reading frame of the entire\nmolecule. This creates a novel immunogenic epitope that is suf-\nficient to allow the production of mAbs (e.g., F8:33 and MFI-\n16-11) recognizing CD44vRA expressed on synovial fluid cells\nof RA patients.

The faint histogram in each panel depicts binding of second antibody only.\npreferential binding of F8:33 to Namalwa-CD44vRA is not\nquantitatively dictated. The selective binding of F8:33 anti-\nCD44vRA mAb to Namalwa-CD44vRA was detected at con-\ncentrations\ufffd 0.4 mg/ml. At increasing concentrations, F8:33\nfirst cross-reacts with Namalwa-CD44v3ev10 (Table 1) and\nthen with Namalwa-CD44s (not shown), implying the existence\nof a hierarchy in binding affinity, the highest to cell surface\nCD44vRA and the lowest to cell surface CD44s.\n\nHowever, the Namalwa transfectants are, in fact, an artifi-\ncial model for evaluating the binding capacity and bioactivity\nof anti-CD44vRA mAbs. To obtain a more realistic assess-\nment, the interaction of F8:33 with authentic RA synovial fluid\ncells and primary keratinocytes was examined. We chose\nkeratinocytes as a reference group, because they are known ex-\npressors of CD44v3ev10 [3,18], the wild type of CD44vRA.\nOwing to the low frequency of CD44v3ev10-positive RA\npatients, it is impractical to use synovial fluid cells from\nsuch donors. Interestingly, the concentration of F8:33 anti-\nCD44vRA that was able to discriminate between RA synovial\nfluid cells and keratinocytes was much higher than that\ndiscriminating between Namalwa-CD44vRA and Namalwa-\nCD44v3ev10. Even at concentrations as high as 100 mg/ml,\nF8:33 bound exclusively to RA synovial fluid cells. This\nconcentration is close to the anti-arthritic \u2018\u2018therapeutic\nwindow\u2019\u2019 of infliximab anti-TNF mAb [19], i.e., the highest\nblood concentration of the antibody, which elicits a therapeutic\nresponse in a patient, but is not toxic. Anti-TNF mAb is\nwidely used in the therapy of RA patients [19], but its possible\nlong-range deleterious effects are not known.\n\nWhy does F8:33 discriminate, at high concentrations, be-\ntween RA synovial fluid cells and keratinocytes, but not\nbetween Namalwa-CD44vRA and Namalwa-CD44v3ev10\nmodel cells? Conceivably, the F8:33 recognizing-epitope, ex-\nposed to the relevant antibody, is differentially expressed on\nthe authentic cells and on model cells, resulting in distinct\nbinding affinities to these two sets of cells. Does expression\nof cell surface CD44vRA entail a functional meaning with\nphysiological or pathological consequences? Namalwa cells\nand RA synovial fluid cells expressing CD44vRA and immo-\nbilizing FGF-2 activate FGF-receptor bearing cells more in-\ntensively than corresponding cells expressing the wild type\nCD44v3ev10 [12]. As activation of the FGF-receptor on\nfibroblasts and endothelial cells in inflammatory joints of\nRA patients is an important factor in the pathology of the\ndisease [20e22], it is conceivable that CD44vRA expression\ncontributes to the RA inflammatory process.\n\nCan the exclusive structure of CD44vRA, expressed on\ninflammatory cells of RA patients, be exploited for selective\n\n\n\n109I.

To address this issue, we\ngenerated anti-CD44vRA mAbs that bound at much higher\nintensity to synovial fluid cells from RA patients than to\nPBLs from the same patients, synovial fluid cells from OA pa-\ntients or keratinocytes from normal donors. Furthermore, the\nanti-CD44vRA mAb interaction with the CD44vRA receptor\nof RA synovial fluid cells delivers apoptotic signals to the\ncell interior, leading to programmed cell death of those cells\ninvolved in the destructive inflammatory cascade of the joint.\nSince the PBLs of the same patients were not affected by this\nantibody treatment, a selective therapeutic effect might be\nobtained in vivo as well. This challenge will be the thrust of\nour future studies.\n\nIt has been well established that the CD44 receptor can di-\nrectly or indirectly deliver apoptotic [23e25] or survival [26]\nsignals. The nature of the signal is possibly dependent on the\nisoform of cell surface CD44 (standard or variant) as well as\non the type of receptor ligand and its concentration or on\nthe components of the extra-vascular tissue associated with\nthe ligand. The presence or absence (e.g., in CD44 knock\nout mice) of cell surface CD44 or the conditions of receptor\nactivation dictate the upregulation or the downregulation of\npro-apoptotic (Apaf-1, Bak, Bax, Bid, Hrk, CRADD, cas-\npase-1, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9) or anti-apoptotic\n(A1, phosphorylated BAD, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, phosphoinositide\n3-kinase, Akt, TANK, OX40, OX40L, TRAF-2 and TRAF-3)\ngenes, leading to programmed cell death or cell survival\n[27e30]. Apoptotic [23e25,27] or anti-apoptotic (survival)\n[26] signals can be delivered following engagement of cell\nsurface CD44 with anti-pan-CD44 mAb [23e27] as well as\nwith its ligand e hyaluronan [23,26]. In addition, anti-CD44\nmAb or hyaluronan can inhibit apoptosis induced by other\nstimuli, including anti-integrin mAb and therapeutic drugs\n[31,32]. The apoptotic [23] or anti-apoptotic [26] signals de-\nlivered by anti-CD44 mAb or hyaluronan may be mediated\nby Fas upregulation or downregulation, respectively.\n\nTargeting of CD44 can attenuate inflammatory-mediated\ndiseases, owing to apoptosis of CD44-positive inflammatory\n\n\n\n110 I.

In contrast, in the absence of CD44 (e.g., in CD44 knock\nout mice), the disease is aggravated because the inflammatory\ncells are not exposed to CD44-transmitted death signals [33].\nConversely, when cell surface CD44 or one of its variants de-\nlivers survival signals, the absence of CD44 allows induction\nof apoptosis in the inflammatory cells and disease attenuation.\nOn the other hand, in the presence of CD44 or CD44 variants,\nthe inflammatory cells are preserved and the disease is exacer-\nbated [34].\n\nWe suggest that the CD44 receptor of synovial fluid cells\nfrom different RA patients (CD44vRA), is committed, owing\nto a relevant setting (as discussed above) to transmit apoptotic\nsignals after interaction with anti-CD44vRA mAbs or with\ncorresponding, yet unknown, natural ligand.

The apoptotic-inducing capacity of F8:33 anti-CD44vRA mAb and anti-pan-hCD44 mAb was analyzed by two-dimensional flow cytometry as\n\nindicated in Fig. 7.\ncircumstances, the concentrations of anti-CD44vRA mAbs\nthat induced programmed cell death in synovial fluid cells of\nRA patients failed to induce or enhance apoptosis in the\nPBLs of the same patients, while anti-pan-CD44 mAbs-in-\nduced apoptosis in RA synovial fluid cells only at high con-\ncentrations. Notably, the apoptotic effect induced in RA\nsynovial fluid cells with anti-CD44vRA mAb was detected\nat a concentration as low as 1 mg/ml, whereas at least 10 times\nhigher concentrations were required to induce apoptosis with\nanti-pan CD44 mAbs, as shown by other investigators\n[23,24,27] and ourselves (Fig. 7).\n\nOur anti-human CD44vRA mAb (designated F8:33) en-\nhances spontaneous apoptosis in spleen cells from arthritic\nmice, but not in spleen cells from normal mice (not shown).\nThe same F8:33 kills by apoptosis synovial fluid cells from\nRA patients, but not PBLs from the same patient (Fig. 7). In\naddition, injection of F8:33, at the onset of CIA, markedly\nreduced joint inflammation in arthritic DBA/1 mice (Fig. 9).\nObviously this begs the question: how does the anti-human\nCD44vRA mAb recognize the CD44 of the arthritic mouse?\nThis enigma appears to be even more complicated, given\nthat we were unable to detect the arthritic CD44 variant\n(CD44vRA) in the joints of arthritic mice (not shown). How-\never, we have found that the spleen cells of arthritic mice\nexpress CD44v3ev10, whereas spleen cells of normal non-\narthritic mice do not express this isoform (but they do express\nstandard CD44). The CD44v3ev10 isoform is the wild type\nmolecule of CD44vRA, i.e. they are identical in sequence,\nbut CD44vRA includes an extra alanine between exon v4\nand v5, without any change in the rest of the reading frame.\nWe compared the sequence of the splicing junction ends of\nv4 and v5 exons in human CD44vRA (where alanine is\ninserted), human CD44v3ev10 and mouse CD44v3ev10.\nSurprisingly we found that the sequence of mouse wild type\nCD44v3ev10, which is expressed in arthritic mice, but not\nin non-arthritic mice, contains alanine like human CD44vRA\n\n\n\n112 I.

This\nsequence comparison can explain why anti-human CD44vRA\nmAb was able to enhance apoptosis in spleen cells from ar-\nthritic mice and to induce at least partial resistance to CIA\nin DBA/1 mice.\n\nWe [5,8] and others [9,10] have shown that a considerable\nnumber of pathological activities in inflammatory and cancer\nexperimental diseases are CD44-dependent. Furthermore,\nthere is circumstantial evidence that CD44 is an important fac-\ntor in the corresponding human diseases as well [1,35]. The in-\ntensive alternative splicing machinery of the CD44 molecule\nprovides opportunities for creating disease-specific targeting\nstructures that cannot be detected in other pro-inflammatory\nor pro-cancerous molecules that are far less subjected to diver-\nsification mechanism. If sequence variations generated in\nCD44 alternative splicing junctions are a ubiquitous phenom-\nenon in CD44-dependent pathologies, specific targeting of\nthese modified structures, e.g., by mAbs, may open up new av-\nenues for specific therapy not only in RA, but also in other\ncancer and inflammatory diseases.\n\n1.5\n\n1.7\n\n1.9\n\n2.1\n\n2.3\n\n2.5\n\n2.7\n\n2.9\n\n3.1\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n\nDays\n\nP\naw\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nNeg.Con.\n\nKM81\nF8:33\nMF1-16-11\n\nOnset of\nDisease\n\nNegative\nControl\nn-=10\n\nKM81\nn=7\n\nF8:33\nn=10\n\nMF1-16-11\nn=6* **\n\n**\n**\n\n**\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n** **\n\n**\n**\n\n**\n**\n**\n\nFig. 9. Anti-human CD44vRA mAbs reduce joint inflammation in mice with\n\ncollagen-induced arthritis (CIA). KM81 anti-mouse pan CD44 mAb (ATCC)\n\nand anti-human CD44vRA mAbs from two clones (F8:33, MF-1-16-11)\n\nwere injected into DBA/1 mice with CIA (see Section 2) at disease onset\n\nand then every other day for 12 days. Isotype-matched anti-mouse mAb\n\n(4D2; five mice) or anti-human mAb (Serotec nonfunctional anti-CD44\n\nmAb; five mice) were injected, using the same experimental protocol, into\n\na control group.
