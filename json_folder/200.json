Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor origi-\nnating from biliary epithelial cells. The tumor suppressor gene \ntropomyosin 1 (TPM1) is downregulated in several human \ncancer types; however, its expression status in cholangiocar-\ncinoma is still unknown. We elucidated TPM1 expression and \nits regulation mechanism in cholangiocarcinoma. Real-time \n(RT)-PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry \nwere performed to examine TPM1 expression levels in chol-\nangiocarcinoma cell lines and tumor tissues. Cell lines were \ntreated with lentiviral vector containing the miR-21 knockdown \nand inhibitors of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms (manu-\nmycin A, LY294002, U0126, DAC and TSA), and the TPM1 \nexpression change was observed by RT-PCR and western blot \nanalyses. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration were \nevaluated by water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay, \nflow cytometry and wound healing experiments, respectively. \nTPM1 was downregulated in the intrahepatic cholangiocar-\ncinoma cells (HuCCT1) and upregulated in the extrahepatic \ncholangiocarcinoma cells (QBC939) compared with normal \nintrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HIBEC). TPM1 stained \nnegative in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues, as \nrevealed by immunohistochemistry, although there was no \nsignificant difference in staining of the intrahepatic cholan-\ngiocarcinoma tissues and adjacent non-cancer tissues. RAS \nand two important downstream signaling pathways (RAS/\nPI3K/AKT and RAS/MEK/ERK) were involved in TPM1 \nregulation and inhibition of the epigenetic mechanisms such as \nDNA methylation, histone deacetylation and miR-21 upregula-\ntion upregulated TPM1 expression. Inhibitors of genetic and \nepigenetic mechanisms (manumycin A, LY294002, U0126, \nDAC and TSA) inhibited cell proliferation and migration and \ninduced apoptosis. These data indicated that TPM1 is down-\n\nregulated in HuCCT1 cells and that the Ras signaling pathway \nas well as DNA methylation, histone deacetylation and miR-21 \nupregulation play important roles in the suppression of TPM1 \nexpression in HuCCT1 cells. Thus, compounds that inhibit \ngenetic and epigenetic mechanisms may be promising agents \nin treating cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCholangiocarcinoma is a significantly devastating tumor, is \ndifficult to diagnose, and has a high mortality rate. The inci-\ndence of cholangiocarcinoma is increasing worldwide (1). In \nrecent years, the 1- and 2-year survival rates were reported to be \n24.5 and 12.8%, respectively. As a result, this tumor continues \nto be associated with a poor prognosis. Cholangiocarcinoma \nis classified into three broad categories, namely intrahepatic, \nperihilar and distal tumors. Resection is considered as the \nbest treatment, radiation or chemotherapy has no influence \non survival and many patients do not get the opportunity to \nundergo surgery (2). Curative surgeries such as liver resection \nand liver transplantation for some hilar cholangiocarcinomas \ncan achieve long-term survival. However, there are no specific \ntumor markers for early diagnosis; a combination of serum \ntumor markers that can identify most occult tumors is used to \nselect appropriate cases for liver transplantation (3). Therefore, \nit is of great value to identify specific tumor markers and novel \nchemical agents for the diagnosis and treatment of cholangio-\ncarcinoma and to improve patient survival.\n\nTropomyosins (TMs) are found as a family of actin fila-\nment-binding proteins in the skeletal muscle. The TM family \nis divided into two major groups: the high molecular weight \n(HMW) and the low molecular weight (LMW) tropomyosins. \nTropomyosin 1 (TPM1) is a gene that encodes isoforms of \nthe HMW TMs (4). The non-muscle cells express multiple \nisoforms of TMs, which are involved in cell transformation and \ndifferentiation and in the regulation of actin filament stability \n(5). HMW TM isoforms are downregulated in some tumors, \nsuch as breast, urinary bladder and neuroblastoma tumors \n(6-9). HMW TMs can regulate the proliferation, motility, \ninvasion, and metastasis of tumor cells (10). TPM1 encodes \nmost important TMs in breast cancer, where it functions as \na suppressor of cell transformation (11). In the present study, \nwe aimed to determine the expression levels of TPM1 and its \nregulation mechanism in cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nGenetic and epigenetic alterations are involved in \nthe regulation of TPM1 in cholangiocarcinoma\n\nWEI YANG,  XIAOYUAN WANG,  WEI ZHENG,  KEDONG LI,  HAOFENG LIU  and  YUEMING SUN\n\nDepartment of Minimally Invasive Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital  \nof Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, P.R.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissue \nand adjacent non-cancer tissue were surgically obtained \nbetween January 2010 and May 2012 from 30 patients at \nThe First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all the patients \nbefore sample collection. The intrahepatic cholangiocarci-\nnoma cells (HuCCT1), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells \n(QBC939) and the normal intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells \n(HIBEC) obtained from American Type Culture Collection \n(ATCC; Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's medium \nessential medium (DMEM; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) \ncontaining 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), \nand streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml) under cell culture conditions \n(5% CO2, 95% relative humidity, and 37\u02daC).\n\nQuantitative real-time (RT)-PCR for TPM1. Total RNA was \npurified from cultured cells using the RNAiso\u2122 Plus kit \n(Takara, Tokyo, Japan). cDNA was synthesized using the \nPrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara) in a 10-\u00b5l reaction mixture \naccording to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA (2 \u00b5l) was \nused as a template in a 20-\u00b5l reaction using the SYBR Premix \nEx Taq real-time PCR kit (Takara). Glyceraldehyde-3-\nphosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the reference \ngene. The following primers were used for the detection of \nTPM1 expression: 5'-ACGAACAACTTGAAGTCACTAA-3' \n(sense) and 5'-TTTAGTTACTGACCTCTCCGCA-3' (anti-\nsense). The primers for GAPDH were: 5'-ACGGATTTGGTC \nGTATTGGGC-3' (sense) and 5'-TTGACGGTGCCATGG \nAATTTG-3' (antisense). PCR was performed using the \nfollowing cycles: 95\u02daC for 30 sec, 40 cycles of 95\u02daC for 5 sec, \n60\u02daC for 31 sec and the dissociation stage: 95\u02daC for 15 sec, \n60\u02daC for 1 min and 95\u02daC for 15 sec.\n\nWestern blot analysis. Cells were lysed, and equal amounts of \nprotein were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide \ngel and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride \n(PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% \nskim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing \n0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The \nmembranes were incubated with the following primary \nantibodies at 4\u02daC overnight: TPM1 (1:400; ab55915, Abcam, \nHong Kong, China), \u03b2-actin (1:800; Beijing Biosynthesis \nBiotechnology, Beijing, China), and \u03b1-tubulin (1:500; Beijing \nBiosynthesis Biotechnology). The membranes were then \nwashed three times with PBST, incubated with horseradish \nperoxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000; \nBeijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology) for 2 h at room tempera-\nture. After three PBST washes, the membranes were developed \nusing ECL Plus (Millipore, MA, USA) and exposed to X-ray \nfilm for visualization of protein bands. \u03b2-actin and \u03b1-tubulin \nwere used as internal loading controls.\n\nImmunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was carried out \non 30 cholangiocarcinoma tissues and 30 adjacent non-cancer \ntissues by overnight incubation at 4\u02daC using a polyclonal \nantibody to TPM1 (ab55915, Abcam). The sections were \nsubsequently treated with goat anti-mouse secondary anti-\nbody, followed by further incubation with streptavidin-HRP \n\ncomplex. Diaminobenzidine (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) \nwas used as a chromogen, and sections were lightly coun-\nterstained with hematoxylin. Immunostaining intensity (0, \nno staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; 3, strong \nstaining) as well as the percentage of cells stained (0, no \ncells; 1, <10% of cells; 2, 11-50% of cells; 3, 51-80% of cells; \n4, >80% of cells) were evaluated, and the respective scores \nwere multiplied, resulting in intensity values ranging from 0 \nto 12. The tissues showing immunostaining intensity values \nin the rage (0-6) were grouped as negative and those showing \nimmunostaining intensity values in the rage (7-12) were \ngrouped as positive.\n\nTaqman\u2122 quantitative RT-PCR for miR-21. Total RNA was \nextracted from cultured cells using the RNAiso Plus (Takara)\nand mature miR-21 was detected using the miRCURY LNA\u2122 \nUniversal RT microRNA PCR kit (Roche, Germany). The \nRT-PCR results were analyzed and expressed as relative Ct \n(threshold cycle) values, which were then converted to fold-\nchanges. Each sample was measured in triplicate. The small \nnuclear RNA U6 (U6 snRNA) was used as an endogenous \ncontrol.\n\nPlasmid construction, lentivirus packaging, and infection. To \nconstruct a lentiviral vector (LV) containing the miR-21 \nknockdown (LV-anti-miR21), as well as the negative control \n(LV-GFP), a complementary sequence that targeted miR-21 \nwas designed and two suitable PCR primers that targeted the \nmiR-21 sequence were annealed in order to obtain the fragment \ninsert. The PCR primers were as follows: forward 5'-CCGGT \nCAACATCAGTCTGATAAGCTATTTTTG-3' and reverse: \n5'-AATTCAAAAATAGCTTATCAGACTGATGTTGA-3'. The \nfragment was cloned into the GV159 vector, after which the \nGV159 vector (20 \u00b5g), the pHelper 1.0 vector (15 \u00b5g), and the \npHelper 2.0 vector (and 10 \u00b5g; Genechem Co., Shanghai, China) \nwere cotransfected into 293T cells (purchased from ATCC) \nusing 100 \u00b5l Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, \nCA, USA). The supernatants were collected 48 h later, were \nfiltered (pore size, 0.45-\u00b5m) and stored at -80\u02daC. HuCCT1 \ncells were infected with either LV-anti-miR21 or LV-green \nfluorescent protein (GFP) in the presence of 5 \u00b5g/ml polybrene \n(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The medium was refreshed after \n6 h, and the efficiency of infection was measured 72 h later \nunder a fluorescent microscope based on GFP expression.\n\nCell proliferation assay. Cells were treated with manumycin A \n(Cayman Chemicals, MI, USA; 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 75 \u00b5mol/) \nfor 24 and 48 h, LY294002 (Sigma; 5, 10, 20 and 50 \u00b5mol) for \n48 and 96 h, U0126 (Sigma; 10, 20, 50 and 75 \u00b5mol) for 48 and \n96 h, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (DAC) (Sigma; 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 25 \nand 100 \u00b5mol) for 24 and 48 h (DAC was replaced with fresh \ndrug every 24 h), and trichostatin A (TSA) (Sigma; 0.1, 0.25, \n0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 \u00b5mol) for 24 and 48 h.\n\nCells (4x103) were seeded in 96-well plates in 100 \u00b5l \nmedium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, when the cells \nwere grown to 50-60% confluency, manumycin A, U0126, \nLY294002, DAC or TSA were added. Cell proliferation was \nassessed at 24 and 48 h or 48 and 96 h by using the Cell \nCounting kit-8 (CCK-8; Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) according \nto the manufacturer's protocol.\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  42:  690-698,  2013692\n\nApoptosis assays. Cells (4x105) were seeded in 6-well plates. \nAfter 24 h, cells were treated with manumycin A (10 \u00b5mol), \nU0126 (75 \u00b5mol) or TSA (0.25 \u00b5mol) for 24 h and LY294002 \n(75 \u00b5mol) and DAC (25 \u00b5mol) for 48 h. Apoptosis was detected \nusing the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (Keygen, \nNanjing, China). Results were represented as the percentage of \napoptotic cells in all the counted cells.\n\nWound healing experiments. Cells (6x105) were seeded in \n6-well plates. After 24 h, when the cells were grown to 90-100% \nconfluency, wounds were generated in cells by scraping with a \nplastic tip across the cell monolayer. The medium was replaced \nwith serum-free medium, and the cells were treated with manu-\nmycin A (5 \u00b5mol), U0126 (10 \u00b5mol), LY294002 (5 \u00b5mol), DAC \n(25 \u00b5mol), TSA (0.1 \u00b5mol) for 24 h. Phase-contrast images were \nrecorded at the time of wounding (0 h) and at 24 h thereafter. \nUntreated cells served as controls.\n\nStatistical analysis. Data were analyzed using the SPSS 13.0 \nsoftware and are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation \n(SD). Statistical comparisons between groups were performed \nusing one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a \nStudent's t-test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nTPM1 expression in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines and tissues. \nTPM1 expression was detected in HuCCT1 and QBC939 cell \nlines using western blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR; \nHIBEC cells were used as a control. At the mRNA level, \nTPM1 was downregulated in HuCCT1 cells and upregulated \n\nin QBC939 cells compared with HIBEC cells (control). At the \nprotein level, TPM1 was expressed at a much lower level in \nHuCCT1 cells compared with HIBEC cells, and was expressed \nat a higher level in QBC939 cells compared with HIBEC cells \n(Fig. 1A), indicating that the different expression of TPM1 in \ncholangiocarcinoma cells, is at the translational and transcrip-\ntional level. The immunohistochemistry results showed no \nstaining (5/30) (Fig. 1B) or a weak staining (25/30) (Fig. 1C) \nfor TPM1 in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues; \nhowever, all the adjacent non-cancer tissues (30/30) showed a \nweak staining for TPM1 (Fig. 1D). For statistical analysis, no \nstaining and weak staining were grouped as negative and there \nwas no significant difference between the staining results of \nintrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues (0/30) and adjacent \nnon-cancer tissues (0/30) (P>0.05).\n\nInvolvement of the Ras mutation in TPM1 downregulation. \nPrevious studies have shown that the Ras signaling pathway \nis involved in TPM1 downregulation in urinary bladder carci-\nnoma and breast cancer (8,12). It is known that the K-ras gene \nis highly mutated in cholangiocarcinoma (13,14). Furthermore, \nstudies have also shown that the HuCCT1 cell line contains \nK-ras mutations that are located at codons 12 and 61, but \nnot at codon 13 and that the mutated Ras family genes may \ncontribute to the growth of cholangiocarcinoma (15,16). The \nRas family genes exert their functions by farnesylating them-\nselves and manumycin offers promise as a specific inhibitor of \nthe farnesylation process (17).

Based on the previous use of manumycin in abolishing the \nfunction of Ras in hepatocellular carcinoma (18) and pancreatic \n\nFigure 1.

Western blot analysis and RT-PCR \nof HuCCT1 cells, which were incubated with manumycin A \n(5 and 10 \u00b5mol/l) for 24 h, showed a significant restoration of \nTPM1 expression (Fig. 2A). This finding supports the role of \nactivated Ras in the downregulation of TPM1.\n\nUpregulation of TPM1 by MEK inhibition. It has been \nshown that the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway participates in the \ndownregulation of TPM1 (8,12). In the present study, U0126, \na specific MEK inhibitor, was used to investigate the role of \n\nthis pathway in the downregulation of TPM1. HuCCT1 cells \nwere incubated for 24 h with U0126 (5 and 10 \u00b5mol/l). At the \nmRNA level, the TPM1 expression increased, as revealed by \nRT-PCR results. Similarly, western blot analysis suggested \nthat U0126 can restore the TPM1 expression in HuCCT1 cells \nat the protein level when compared with that in untreated \ncontrols (Fig. 2B).\n\nInvolvement of the Ras/PI3K/AKT pathway in the expres-\nsion of TPM1. Previous studies have reported that the PI3K/\nAKT pathway does not affect the expression of TPM1 (8,21). \nHowever, contradictory to this study, we found that the \n\nFigure 2.

The present study showed that \ngenetic mutations in the Ras signaling pathway play an impor-\ntant role in the regulation of TPM1 expression. The underlying \nepigenetic mechanisms have been found in breast cancer (6,22) \nand melanoma (23). To elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms \nresponsible for TPM1 regulation in cholangiocarcinoma, we \ntreated HuCCT1 cells with the demethylating agent, DAC or \nwith the histone deacetylase inhibitor, TSA and subsequently \nanalyzed TPM1 expression using western blots and RT-PCR. \nEvaluation of TPM1 expression before and after treatment \nof HuCCT1 cells with DAC and TSA showed that TPM1 \nmRNA and protein expression (Fig. 2D) was significantly \nupregulated after a 24-h treatment with DAC (1 and 5 \u00b5mol/l) \ncompared to untreated cells. The TPM1 mRNA expression \nwas slightly upregulated in HuCCT1 cells after a 24-h treat-\nment with 0.1 \u00b5mol/l TSA, but not after a 24-h treatment with \n0.25 \u00b5mol/l TSA. However, contradictory to the mRNA levels, \nthe TPM1 protein level in TSA-treated cells was significantly \nupregulated compared to untreated cells (Fig. 2E).\n\nmiR-21 is overexpressed in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. \nTaqMan quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated an \noverexpression of miR-21 in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines \ncompared with non-malignant biliary epithelial cells (Fig. 3A). \nThis result was in agreement with a previous study showing \nthat miR-21 functions as an oncogene in cholangiocarcinoma \n(24). We also observed an inverse correlation between the \nlevels of miR-21 and TPM1 in HuCCT1 cells, which suggests \n\nthat miR-21 may also be involved in the loss of function of \nTPM1 in HuCCT1 cells.\n\nmiR-21 negatively regulates TPM1 protein levels in HuCCT1 \ncells. Previous studies reported that miR-21 promoted tumor \ngrowth through the downregulation of TPM1 in breast cancer \n(25,26), tongue squamous cell carcinoma (27), prostate cancer \n(28) and glioma (29). In the present study, to investigate the \nrelationship between miR-21 and TPM1 levels in HuCCT1 \ncells, a lentiviral vector containing the miR-21 knockdown \n(LV-anti-miR21) was constructed. In LV-anti-miR21-infected \nHuCCT1 cells, the miR-21 level was downregulated compared \nwith that in LV-GFP-infected HuCCT1 cells (negative control) \n(Fig. 3B). RT-PCR and western blot analyses performed to \ninvestigate the effect of miR-21 on TPM1 expression showed \nthat there was no difference in TPM1 expression in LV-anti-\nmiR21-infected or LV-GFP (negative control)-infected \nHuCCT1 cells at the RNA level. However, at the protein level, \nthere was a significant increase in TPM1 expression in LV-anti-\nmiR21-infected HuCCT1 cells compared with that in LV-GFP \n(negative control)-infected HuCCT1 cells (Fig. 3C and D).\n\nInhibitor-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. In the present \nstudy, HuCCT1 cells were exposed to the inhibitors manu-\nmycin A, LY294002, U0126, DAC and TSA to investigate \ntheir effect on cell growth inhibition in cholangiocarcinoma. \nThere are no previous reports on the use of manumycin in the \ntreatment of cholangiocarcinoma. Results of the CCK-8 assay \nshowed that manumycin A inhibited HuCCT1 proliferation in \na dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Because PI3K/\nAKT and MEK/ERK are two important signaling pathways \nin cholangiocarcinoma (30,31), the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 \nand the MEK inhibitor U0126 have been previously used \nto investigate their antiproliferative effect on cholangio-\n\nFigure 3.

To our knowledge, our study is the \nfirst to analyze the effects of LY294002 and U0126 on the \nproliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HuCCT1 cells. We \ndemonstrated that LY294002 and U0126 inhibited HuCCT1 \nproliferation in a dose- and in a time-dependent manner, in \nagreement with previous studies (16,32-35) (Fig. 4B and C). \nAlthough extrahepatic cholangiocarcninoma cells and gall-\n\nbladder carcinoma cells have been treated with the inhibitors \nDAC or TSA in previous studies (36,37), their effect on intra-\nhepatic cholangiocarcninoma cells is unknown. In the present \nstudy, we made a novel observation that DAC inhibited the \ngrowth of HuCCT1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent \nmanner (Fig. 4D). Our results were in agreement with those \nof a previous study showing that DAC inhibited the growth of \n\nFigure 4. Growth inhibition and apoptosis in HuCCT1 cells.

We \nalso found that TSA inhibited the growth of HuCCT1 cells in \na dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4E).\n\nInhibitor-induced increase in apoptosis of cholangiocar-\ncinoma cell lines. Our results showed that manumycin A, \nLY294002, U0126, DAC and TSA were able to inhibit the \ngrowth of HuCCT1 cells. We further demonstrated that \ninhibitor-treated HuCCT1 cells underwent increased apoptosis \ncompared with the untreated cells. Manumycin A(10 \u00b5mol/l), \nLY294002 (75 \u00b5mol/l) and U0126 (75 \u00b5mol/l), DAC (25 \u00b5mol/l) \nand TSA (0.25 \u00b5mol/l) significantly increased apoptosis of \nHuCCT1 cells (Fig. 4A, B, C, D and E respectively) compared \nwith untreated cells (P<0.05).\n\nInhibition of cell migration by manumycin A, LY294002, \nU0126, DAC and TSA. Migration is one of the most important \ncharacteristics of malignant tumors, especially of cholangio-\ncarcinomas. TPM1 plays an important role in cell motility \nand migration (10,11). We used specific inhibitors that blocked \ngenetic and epigenetic mechanisms to investigate whether the \nmigration of HuCCT1 cells is affected. HuCCT1 cells were \nwounded and treated with 5 \u00b5mol/l manumycin A, 5 \u00b5mol/l \nLY294002, 20 \u00b5mol/l U0126, 25 \u00b5mol/l DAC and 0.1 \u00b5mol/l \nTSA. Images were recorded at the time of wounding (0 h) \nand after 24 h. After 24 h, all the five inhibitors inhibited the \nmigration of HuCCT1 cells in culture (Fig. 5).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIt has been previously reported that TPM1 functions as a tumor \nsuppressor gene and is downregulated in cancers originating \nfrom the epithelial cells, such as breast cancer, colon cancer \nand urinary bladder carcinoma (6-8). However, the status and \nsignificance of TPM1 expression in cholangiocarcinoma has \n\nnever been investigated. In the present study, we determined \nTPM1 expression levels in cholangiocarcinoma tissues and \ncell lines.\n\nRT-PCR and western blot analyses revealed that TPM1 \nexpression was downregulated in HuCCT1 cells and upregu-\nlated in QBC939 cells at the mRNA level and protein level. \nThe HuCCT1 cell line was selected to investigate the mecha-\nnism of TPM1 downregulation, because TPM1 expression was \nsignificantly downregulted compared to HIBEC and HuCCT1 \ncell line contains K-ras mutations so that it is the appropriate \ncell model to investigate the role of ras signaling pathway in \ndownregulating TPM1 expression. However, the discrepancy \nin TPM1 expression observed in the HuCCT1 and QBC939 \ncell lines requires further studies.\n\nContradictory to previous reports on cholangiocarcinoma \ncell lines, we found that there was no significant difference \nbetween TPM1 expression in cancer tissues and adjacent \nnon-cancer tissues. Previous immunohistochemical studies \nhave shown that TPM1 expression decreases in tongue \nsquamous cell carcinoma tissue compared with the normal \ntongue tissue (27). However, in our study, no significant \nchange in TPM1 expression between the cholangiocarcinoma \ntissues and adjacent non-cancer tissues was observed. This \ndiscrepancy in TPM1 expression in tissues and cell lines may \nbe due to our relative small sample size, or due to the fact that \nimmuno histochemistry was not able to identify the expres-\nsion change in TPM1. Because HIBEC cells are derived from \nnormal intrahepatic biliary cells, it is desirable to use normal \nintrahepatic biliary tissues in future immunohistochemical \nstudies.\n\nTo further understand the mechanism of TPM1 down-\nregulation in HuCCT1 cells, we investigated the role of the \nRas signaling pathway and of the epigenetic mechanisms \nsuch as DNA methylation, histone deacetylation and miR-21 \nupregulation in the regulation of TPM1. Previous studies have \n\nFigure 5. Migration of HuCCT1 cells measured in wound healing experiments after the treatment with inhibitors, compared with migration of untreated cells.\n\n\n\nYANG et al:  TPM1 IN CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA 697\n\nshown that the ras pathway plays an important role in the \ndownregulation of TPM1 in urinary bladder carcinoma and \nbreast cancer (8,12), Given that the activated Ras mutation \nhad been reported in HuCCT1 cells (15,16), we treated these \ncells with manumycin A, a specific inhibitor of Ras function. \nOur study is the first to investigate the effect of manumycin on \ncholangiocarcinoma cells, and show that TPM1 is significantly \nupregulated in HuCCT1 cells, indicating that Ras plays an \nimportant role in the downregulation of TPM1 in cholangio-\ncarcinoma. Furthermore, our study suggested that the activated \nMEK/ERK pathway contributes to the downregulation of \nTPM1, which is in agreement with a previous study showing \nthat the MEK/ERK pathway is involved in TPM1 regulation \n(8,21). Contradictory to the role of the MEK/ERK pathway, \nsome literature reports conclude that the PI3K/AKT pathway \nhas no effect on the downregulation of TPM1 (8,21); however, \nwe inferred that activated PI3K/AKT pathway upregulated \nTPM1 expression on the basis of our finding that inhibition \nof PI3K/AKT pathway downregulated TPM1 expression. \nSp1-binding sites in the TPM1 promoter have been identified, \nand Sp1 is known to play an important role in the induction \nof TPM1 (22). Furthermore, other studies have shown that \nactivated PI3K/Akt can recruit Sp1 to increase the promoter \nactivity in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and clear cell \nrenal cell carcinoma cells (38,39). Thus, these results suggest \nthat inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway downregulates \nTPM1 expression in HuCCT1 cells.\n\nDNA methylation is one of the possible mechanisms that \ncontributes to the downregulation of TPM1 (22). Similarly, \nhistone deacetylation is another mechanism involved in \nthe regulation of TPM1 expression in breast cancer and in \nmelanoma (6,23). In the present study, DAC and TSA were \nused to treat HuCCT1 cells, both of which upregulated TPM1 \nexpression, indicating that DNA methylation as well as histone \ndeacetylation play an important role in TPM1 expression in \ncholangiocarcinoma cells. Further studies assessing the meth-\nylation of individual CpG sites in the TPM1 promoter before \nand after DAC treatment are required to shed further light on \nthe regulatory mechanism.\n\nAlong with the involvement of DNA methylation and \nhistone deacetylation in the downregulation of TPM1, we \nalso identified TPM1 as a target of miR-21. Many studies \nhave shown that TPM1 is a direct target of miR-21 (25-29), \nand that miR-21 is upregulated in cholangiocarcinoma (40). In \nour study, miR-21 was shown to be upregulated in HuCCT1 \ncells compared with HIBEC cells, indicating that miR-21 may \nregulate TPM1 expression in HuCCT1 cells. Using miR-21 \nknockdown to investigate the change in TPM1 expression at \nthe mRNA and protein levels, we demonstrated that miR-21 \nregulates TPM1 at the protein level, but not at the mRNA level. \nA luciferase activity assay should be performed in the future \nto determine whether TPM1 is a direct target of miR-21.\n\nCholangiocarcinoma is a malignancy of the biliary tract \nthat is highly chemoresistant to chemical agents used in \nthe clinic; however, the mechanisms regulating cholangio-\ncarcinoma growth and resistance to chemotherapy remain \npoorly understood (40). Our study investigated the inhibitory \neffect of these chemical agents on HuCCT1 cells. Involvement \nof the activated Ras mutation in cholangiocarcinoma has been \ndemonstrated (15,16). We used manumycin A for the first time \n\nto treat cholangiocarcinoma cells and showed that it could \ninhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis and inhibit migration of \nHuCCT1 cells, thus suggesting that manumycin by blocking \nthe function of Ras could serve as an important agent to treat \ncholangiocarcinoma. Although the use of PI3K/AKT and \nMEK/ERK inhibitors as anticancer agents has been widely \nacknowledged, few have made it to clinical trials. Our study \nindicated that the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 and the \nMEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 inhibited the growth and migration \nof HuCCT1 cells and induced apoptosis, suggesting that these \nsignaling pathway inhibitors may be an optimized therapeutic \nstrategy against cholangiocarcinoma (30). Although inhibitors \nof DNA methylation and histone deacetylation have been used \nto treat metastatic gallbladder cancer cells (41) and extrahepatic \ncholangiocarcinoma cells (37), their effect on intrahepatic chol-\nangiocarcinoma cells was previously unknown, and recent data \nhave shown that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation \nare promising targets of cancer treatment (36,37). Our results \nshowed that DAC and TSA shortened the survival time of \nHuCCT1 cells, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell migration, \nindicating that DAC and TSA would be promising agents in the \ntreatment of cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nIn the present study, investigations to elucidate the under-\nlying mechanisms of TPM1 downregulation were focused on \nthe Ras signaling pathway, showing the involvement of both \nthe Ras downstream signaling pathways, RAS/PI3K/AKT and \nRAS/MEK/ERK, in TPM1 downregulation. This is the first \nreport suggesting the possible mechanism underlying TPM1 \nsuppression in cholangiocarcinoma; in particular, this is the \nfirst attempt to block the function of Ras in order to investigate \nthe role of the Ras signal pathway in cholangiocarcinoma. \nIn addition to genetic mutation mechanisms, our study also \nfound that the three important epigenetic mechanisms, namely \nDNA methylation, histone deacetylation, and miR-21 upregu-\nlation were all involved in the downregulation of TPM1 in \ncholangiocarcinoma. In conclusion, the mechanism of TPM1 \ndownregulation is very complicated, and inhibitors targeting \ngenetic signal pathways or epigenetic mechanisms may be \npromising agents to treat cholangiocarcinoma in the future.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis study was supported by the Department of Health of the \nJiangSu Province Fund.\n\nReferences\n\n  1.
