This\nstudy determined the effect of TGF-b1 on the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis in the disc cells,\nwith the aim to provide molecular mechanism support for the prevention and treatment of disc\ndegeneration. Annulus fibrosus (AF) cells were isolated and cultured under serum starvation. 10 ng/mL\nTGF-b1 reduced the apoptosis incidence in the cells under serum starvation for 48 h, down-regulated\nthe autophagy incidence in the cells pretreated with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or Bafilomycin A (Baf A),\npartly rescued the increased apoptosis incidence in the cells pretreated with 3-MA, while further reduced\nthe decreased apoptosis incidence in the cells pretreated with Baf A. Meanwhile, TGF-b1 down-regulated\nthe expressions of autophagic and apoptotic markers in the cells under starvation, partly down-regulated the\nexpressions of Beclin-1, LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3 in the cells pretreated with 3-MA or\nBaf A, while significantly decreased the expression of Bax/Bcl-2 in the cells pretreated with Baf A.\n3-MA blocked the phosphorylation of both AKT and mTOR and partly reduced the inhibitory effect of\nTGF-b1 on the expression of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. TGF-b1 enhanced the expression of\np-ERK1/2 and down-regulated the expressions of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. U0126 partly reversed\nthis inhibitory effect of TGF-b1. In conclusion, TGF-b1 protected against apoptosis of AF cells under\nstarvation through down-regulating excessive autophagy. PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR and MAPK\u2013ERK1/2 were\nthe possible signaling pathways involved in this process.\n\n\ufffd 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nIntervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) was recognized as the\nmain cause for lower back pain [1\u20133], and IVDD did exist in 97%\nof individuals aged more than 50 years old in an autopsy study\n[4]. IVDD is definitely a consequence of aging. However, the under-\nlying molecular mechanism implicated in the pathogenesis of\nIVDD has not been fully understood, although increased death of\nthe intervertebral disc cells has been demonstrated to have an\nessential role in this process [5\u201310].\n\nApoptosis and autophagy are two main programmed cell death\npatterns [11,12]. In addition to their importance as biological\nphenomena, defective apoptotic process or excessive autophagy\nhas been implicated in an extensive variety of diseases\n[10,13,14]. It was reported that increased apoptosis or excessive\nautophagy in the intervertebral disc cells was also involved in\nthe pathogenesis of IVDD [11,15\u201317]. Meanwhile, apoptosis and\nautophagy were closely linked and autophagy could either inhibit\nor delay the occurrence of apoptosis [18\u201323], or promote apoptosis\n[24,25]. However, the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis\nin the intervertebral disc cells and its implication in the pathogen-\nesis of IVDD has not been clarified.\n\nStudies have shown that transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1)\nwas a critical factor in cartilage and spine tissue development\n[26,27]. It increased the proteoglycan synthesis in human interver-\ntebral discs [28], and decreased the intervertebral disc degenera-\ntion in rabbits [29]. Meanwhile, the effect of TGF-b1 on the\ncrosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy in various types of cells\nhas also been studied with contradictory results [30\u201332]. TGF-b1\ncould protect against mesangial cell apoptosis via induction of\nautophagy [19], while it could induce autophagy and promote\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.cyto.2014.07.249&domain=pdf\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2014.07.249\nmailto:jiangleisheng@126.com\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2014.07.249\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine\n\n\n88 B.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396\napoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells [33], bovine mammary\nepithelial cell [34], and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells\n[32]. However, the role of TGF-b1 on the crosstalk between apopto-\nsis and autophagy in the intervertebral disc cells has never been\ncomprehensively explored.\n\nBased on the background mentioned above, we believe that\nunderstanding the molecular mechanisms involving the survival\nand death of the intervertebral disc cells has important clinical sig-\nnificance in the prevention and treatment of degenerative disco-\ngenic diseases. According to our previous study, intervertebral\ndisc cells underwent programmed cell death via different signal\ntransduction pathways in response to multiple stimuli [5]. In this\nstudy, we used serum deprivation to induce programmed cell\ndeath in the annulus fibrosus (AF) cells as previous described\n[35\u201337], observed the interactions between apoptosis and\nautophagy in the cells, and investigated the effect of TGF-b1 on this\ncrosstalk. Because the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling path-\nways were commonly involved in the regulation of autophagy, we\nhypothesized that TGF-b1 could protect against apoptosis through\ninhibition of excessive autophagy in the AF cells under serum star-\nvation via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Isolation and culture of AF cells\n\nTwenty-four Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats aged 2 months old\nwere killed by an overdose intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral\nhydrate (3.5 mL/kg). The AF tissue was obtained from L1\u2013L6 inter-\nvertebral discs under aseptic condition. Isolation and culture of the\nprimary-passage AF cells were carried out as previously described\n[35]. AF cells were collected and seeded into appropriate culture\nplates maintained in a monolayer at a 37 \ufffdC, 5% CO2 environment,\nand the first-passage AF cells were used throughout the experi-\nments. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal\nCare and Use Committee of our university, conformed to the\ninstitutional guidelines.\n\n2.2. Reagents and antibodies\n\nRabbit monoclonal antibodies T-AKT, P-AKT, P-mTOR, T-mTOR,\ncleaved caspase-3, Beclin-1 and LC3 II/I, Bcl-2, T-ERK1/2 and\nP-ERK1/2 and rabbit polyclonal antibody Bax were purchased from\nCell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA, USA). 3-Methyladenine\n(3-MA), acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine (MDC)\nwere obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The\nLyso-Tracker Kit, Lipofectamine-2000 transfection reagent, the\nAlexafluor 488-labeled and the Alexafluor 594-labeled secondary\nantibodies were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).\nAnnexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit I was got from BD Pharm-\ningen (San Diego, CA, USA). DMEM/Ham\u2019s F12 was purchased from\nGibco/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). TGF-b1 was purchased from\nPeprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). Hoechst 33258 and Bafilomycin A\nwere purchased from Biotime (Shanghai, China). GFP-LC3 plasmid\nwas kindly provided by Dr. Li Wang (Neonatology, Shanghai Jiao\nTong University).\n\n2.3. Transmission electronic microscopy for autophagosomes\n\nThe AF cells were cultured in DMEM with complete serum\ndeprivation for 24 and 48 h. Then the cells were separately fixed\nin 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,\nPH = 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature and postfixed in 1% osmium\ntetroxide in water for 1 h, and stained in 2% uranyl acetate in water\nfor 1 h in the dark. After dehydration in an ascending series of\nethanol, the AF cells were embedded in Durcopan ACM for 6 h,\ncut into 80 nm sections. All these sections were stained with ura-\nnyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined under a transmission\nelectron microscope (Philips CM, Netherlands). AF cells cultured\nin DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were served\nas control.\n\n2.4. Detection of apoptotic cells by Hoechst 33258 staining\n\nThe AF cells in starvation for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h were prepared\nat a density of 5000 cells per well in 24-well plates. Apoptotic cells\nwere detected by using the Hoechst 33258 (2 lg/mL) staining as\npreviously described [36,38]. Morphologic changes in the apopto-\ntic nuclei were evaluated under a fluorescence microscope with\nexcitation wave length 350 nm, emission filter 460 nm (Olympus\nFluoview, Japan). A percentage was calculated by the strong blue\nstaining cells/total cells ratio \ufffd 100% in five random fields. AF cells\ncultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS were served as control.\n\n2.5. Autophagy incidence quantified by flow cytometry\n\nThe first-passage AF cells were cultured in 6-well plates at\n2 \ufffd 105 cells per well with DMEM containing 10% FBS. After reach-\ning 90% confluence, the medium was changed to DMEM containing\n1% FBS for 12 h to synchronize the cells and the cells were sub-\njected to serum starvation. Autophagy incidence was measured\nby quantifying the development of acidic vesicular organelles\n(AVOs) after AO staining (0.5 lg/mL) for 15 min at 37 \ufffdC [39],\nand immediately determined as percentage of AO positive cells\nanalyzed with a FACS Canto II software (BD, USA).\n\n2.6. Measurement of apoptosis by flow cytometry\n\nThe apoptosis incidence of AF cells was detected by using the\nAnnexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit (BD\nPharmingen) as previously described [35]. Apoptotic cells, includ-\ning those staining positive for Annexin V-FITC and negative for PI\nand those double positive for Annexin V-FITC and PI, were counted\nand represented as a percentage of the total cell count.\n\n2.7. Real-time PCR analysis\n\nTotal RNA from the AF cells were extracted using RNAiso Plus\nKit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s proto-\ncol. The purity and concentration of isolated RNA were measured\nspectrophotometrically at OD260 and OD280. Complementary DNA\nwas synthesized from 1 lg of total RNA using the PrimeScript RT\nMaster Mix Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). The gene expression of\nBeclin-1, LC-3, and GAPDH was measured by real-time PCR using\nthe Premix EX Taq Kit (Tli RnaseH Plus, TakaRa) and the ABI Prism\n7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystem, Foster City,\nCA, USA). The specific primers were designed and synthesized\ncommercially (Takara, Dalian, China), and the sequences were\nlisted below:\n\nBeclin-1 (bp:154): forward, 50-GAAACTGGACACGAGCTTCAAGA-\n30; reverse, 50-ACCATCCTGGCGAGTTTCAATA-30 (Primer set ID:\nRA056559; GenBank Acc. NM 001034117.1).\n\nLC3 (bp:102): forward, 50-AGCTCTGAAGGCAACAGCAACA-30;\nreverse, 50-GCTCCATGCAGGTAGCAGGAA-30 (Primer set ID:\nRA019913; GenBank Acc. NM 022867.2).\n\nGAPDH (bp:143): forward, 50-GGCACAGTCAAGGCTGAGAATG-\n30; reverse, 50-ATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCAGTA-30 (Primer set ID: RA\n015380; GenBank Acc. NM 017008.3).\n\nThe reaction mixture was amplified at 50 \ufffdC for 2 min and dena-\ntured at 95 \ufffdC for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \ufffdC for 5 s and\n60 \ufffdC for 34 s. The optimal concentrations of primers and templates\n\n\n\nB.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396 89\nused in each reaction were established according to the standard\ncurve created before the reaction. The fold change in all sample\nmRNA expressions was calculated by 2\ufffdDDC.\n\n2.8. Western blot analysis\n\nThe AF cells were treated according to the study protocol and\nharvested at indicated time points. 40 lg total protein from\ndifferent samples were electrophoresed in different concentrations\n(6%, 10%, 12%) of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel and\nelectrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane\n(Beyotime, Shanghai, China). After washing for three times with\n10 mM Tris-buffered saline with 1.0% Tween-20, the polyvinylidene\ndifluoride membranes were incubated with 5% dehydrated skim\nmilk to block nonspecific protein binding and then incubated with\nrabbit monoclonal antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 (CST,\n#9964, 1:1000 dilution), Bcl-2 (CST, #2870, 1:2000 dilution),\nT-AKT (CST, #4691, 1:1000 dilution), Phospho-AKT (CST, #4060,\n1:1000 dilution), Beclin-1 (CST, #3495, 1:1000 dilution), LC3 II/I\n(CST, #3868, 1:500 dilution), T-mTOR (CST, #2983, 1:2000\ndilution), Phospho-mTOR (CST, #5536, 1:2000 dilution), T-P44/42\nMAPK\u2013ERK1/2 (CST, #4695, 1:1000 dilution), Phospho-P44/42\nMAPK\u2013ERK1/2 (CST, #4370, 1:1000 dilution), and rabbit polyclonal\nantibodies against Bax (CST, #2772, 1:1000 dilution) overnight at\n4 \ufffdC. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with horserad-\nish peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG secondary antibod-\nies (diluted 1:1000\u20131:2000, Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) and\nvisualized by the Super Signal Chemiluminescent Substrate system\n(Millipore or BeyoECL Plus). Protein band images were quantified\nby densitometry analysis using the Bio-Rad Image Lab 2.0 software\n(Bio-Rad Laboratory, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\n2.9. Lysosomal activity detected by monodansylcadaverine and Lyso-\nTracker staining\n\nMonodansylcadaverine (MDC) is a marker for autolysosomes.\nAfter starvation for 48 h, AF cells with or without 10 ng/mL\nTGF-b1 were incubated with MDC (0.05 mM) for 10 min at 37 \ufffdC.\nSubsequently, the cells were washed four times with PBS and ana-\nlyzed by fluorescence microscopy (excitation wavelength 380 nm,\nemission filter 525 nm) (Olympus Fluoview, Japan). Lysosomal\nactivity was assessed by using the LysoTracker kit (Invitrogen,\nUSA). After cultured at a density of 5000 cells per well, the starved\nAF cells with or without TGF-b1 were incubated with LysoTracker\nRed (100 nM) for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC and then observed using confocal\nmicroscopy (Olympus Fluoview, Japan). The cells cultured under\nserum condition were served as control groups.\n\n2.10. Immunofluorescence analysis for autophagy related proteins\n\nAF cells were seeded onto a 24-well plate at a density of 5000/\nper well with sterile glass cover slips as previous described [35].\nAfter serum deprivation for 48 h with or without 10 ng/mL TGF-\nb1, the AF cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with\n4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After washed three times\nwith PBS, the AF cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X 100\nin PBS for 15 min and washed three times again in PBS, and then\nblocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room\ntemperature. The AF cells were then incubated with primary anti-\nbodies Beclin-1 (CST, #3495, 1:50 dilution) and LC3 II/I (CST,\n#3868, 1:30 dilution) respectively in 5% BSA overnight at 4 \ufffdC. Cells\ncultured under serum condition with isotype antibody were served\nas control groups. Subsequently, the AF cells were washed in PBS\nfor three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor-488 or Alexa\nFluor-594 conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (dilution\n1:100) for 30 min at room temperature in dark. The cells were then\nwashed three times with PBS and incubated with DAPI for 5 min.\nFinally, the cells were examined by a fluorescence microscopy\n(Olympus BX-FLA, Japan).\n\n2.11. GFP-LC3 plasmid transfection and autophagy assay\n\nAF cells were incubated at a density of 2 \ufffd 105 on 12-well plates\nand cultured up to 60% confluence. GFP-LC3 transfection was car-\nried out with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer\u2019s\nrecommendation. 2 mg/mL GFP-LC3 plasmid DNA in each dish was\nused. After incubation in Opti-MEM medium for 6 h, the cells were\nincubated in complete culture medium again for 24 h. Then the\ntransfected cells were treated with serum deprivation for 48 h with\nor without 10 ng/mL TGF-b1. Finally, the cells were fixed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde, and then washed twice in cold PBS. Autophagy\nwas evaluated by analyzing the formation of fluorescent puncta of\nautophagosomes in GFP-LC3 transfected cells under the fluores-\ncent microscope.\n\n2.12. Statistical analysis\n\nData were presented as means \u00b1 SD (standard deviation) for at\nleast three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were\nperformed by using the SPSS 13 statistical software program (SPSS\nInc., IL, USA). Multiple comparison of data among the groups were\ndetermined by the one-way ANOVA followed by the least significant\ndifference test (Fisher test) and the significance was evaluated by\nthe unpaired Student\u2019s test for comparisons between two means.\nA P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. The evidence of autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under\nserum deprivation and their interactions\n\nAt first, the evidence of autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells\nunder serum deprivation were investigated. Autophagosomes,\ncharacterized as double-membrane vacuolar structures containing\ndifferent cytoplasmic fragment of damaged organelles or\naggregate-prone proteins, could be detected under transmission\nelectronic microscopy in the AF cells after starvation for 24 h, and\ncould be more easily found in the cells after starvation for 48 h\n(Fig. 1A). Hoechst 33258 staining demonstrated that apoptotic cells\nbegan to be detectable after starvation for 24 h, and the number of\napoptotic cells increased further after starvation for 48 h (Fig. 1B).\n\nThen the autophagy incidence of the AF cells under serum\ndeprivation for various time periods (12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h)\nwas measured by quantifying the development of acidic vesicular\norganelles (AVOs) after AO staining. Flow cytometric analysis\nrevealed that the autophagy incidence in AF cells maintained in a\nrelatively low level (3.6%) when they were under DMEM cultiva-\ntion with serum in vitro. However, the autophagy incidence began\nto increase in the cells after 12-h serum deprivation, further\nincreased steadily during 24\u201336 h, reached a peak value (29.9%)\nat 48 h, and then declined to 19.1% at 60 h (Fig. 1C). Furthermore,\nthe protein and mRNA expressions of the biomarkers of autophagy\nand apoptosis were evaluated. Real-time PCR assay revealed that\nthe mRNA expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3 in the AF cells under\nserum deprivation began to increase at 12 h, reached their highest\nlevels at 48 h, and then decreased at 60 h (Fig. 1D). Western blot\nanalysis revealed similar results that the protein expressions of\nBeclin-1 and LC3 II/I gradually increased when the cells were cul-\ntured under serum deprivation for 12\u201348 h and then decreased\nat 60 h (Fig. 1E). However, the protein expression of cleaved cas-\npase-3 remained at a low level in the cells under serum deprivation\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Evidence of autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under serum deprivation. AF cells were cultured under serum deprivation for 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h. (A)\nTransmission electronic microscopy (TEM) for autophagosomes. Much more autophagosomes were detected in the AF cells after 48-h starvation. (B) Hoechst 33258 staining\nfor apoptosis. The number of apoptotic cells significantly increased with the time of serum deprivation. (C) Flow cytometric measurement for autophagy incidence. The\nautophagy incidence increased gradually after 12 h, and reached the highest level (29.9%) at 48 h after serum starvation. (D) Real-time PCR analysis. The mRNA expressions of\nBeclin-1 and LC3 increased steadily after starvation for 12\u201348 h, and then decreased gradually. (E) Western blot evaluation. The protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3 II/I\ngradually increased in the cells under serum deprivation for 12\u201348 h and then gradually decreased. The protein expression of cleaved casepase-3 began to increase gradually\nin the cells under serum starvation for 24 h. (F) Flow cytometric measurement for apoptosis incidence. The apoptosis incidence began to increase gradually in the cells after\n24 h of serum deprivation. For quantitative evaluations, the data were presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. AF cells cultured in serum were served as control. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01\nversus control.\n\n90 B.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396\nfor 12 h. Only after the cells were serum-starved for 24 h did\ncleaved caspase-3 begin to increase steadily in the cells (Fig. 1E).\nMeanwhile, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the level\nof apoptosis incidence in AF cells under serum starvation gradually\nincreased accordingly (Fig. 1F).\n\nThese results suggested that serum deprivation could lead to\nboth autophagy and apoptosis in AF cells, and autophagy occurred\nearlier than apoptosis.\n\nFinally, the interactions between autophagy and apoptosis in\nthe AF cells under serum deprivation were investigated. According\nto our results that the AF cells under serum deprivation had the\nmost significant autophagy at 48 h (Fig. 1C\u2013E), we choose this time\npoint in our next studies. The AF cells were pretreated with 5 mM\n3-MA (an actually autophagy stimulator in this study [40]), or\n100 nM Baf A (a widely used autophagy inhibitor), or vehicle\n(0.1% dimethylsulfoxide) for 2 h and cultured in serum-free DMEM\nfor 48 h. Flow cytometric measurements demonstrated that treat-\nment with 3-MA definitely increased the autophagy incidence\n(Fig. 2A), while at the same time increased the apoptosis incidence\n(Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis also revealed that 3-MA increased\nthe autophagic protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3 II/I\n(Fig. 2C), while at the same time increased the apoptotic protein\nexpressions of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 (Fig. 2D). These\nresults suggested that excessive autophagy led to apoptosis in\nthe AF cells under serum starvation.\nInterestingly, inhibition of autophagy by Baf A led to unex-\npected increases of the autophagy incidence (Fig. 2A) and the\nexpression of LC3 II/I (Fig. 2C), but had no effect on the protein\nexpression of Beclin-1 (Fig. 2C). At the same time Baf A did reduce\nthe apoptosis incidence (Fig. 2B), and the protein expression of\ncleaved caspase-3, whereas actually increased the expression of\nBax/Bcl-2 (Fig. 2D).\n3.2. The effect of TGF-b1 on autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells\nunder serum deprivation\n\nTo investigate the effect of TGF-b1 on autophagy and apoptosis\nin the AF cells under serum deprivation, cells were cultured in\nserum-free medium with various concentrations of TGF-b1 (5, 10\nand 20 ng/mL) for 48 h. The concentration range of TGF-b1 was\ndecided according to previous studies which demonstrated that\n2\u201320 ng/mL TGF-b1 was efficient in various cell types [19,28,41].\n\nFlow cytometric analysis demonstrated that TGF-b1 did not alter\neither the autophagy incidence (Fig. 2A) or the apoptosis incidence\n(Fig. 2B) of AF cells under DMEM cultivation with 10% FBS. How-\never, the highest autophagy incidence in the AF cells under serum\nstarvation for 48 h decreased most significantly when 10 ng/mL of\nTGF-b1 was added into the culture medium (Fig. 3A). At the same\ntime, 10 ng/mL of TGF-b1 also most significantly reduced the\n\n\n\nFig. 2. The interactions between autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under serum deprivation. AF cells were cultured under serum deprivation for 48 h. (A) Flow\ncytometric measurements for the autophagy incidence. Both 3-MA and Baf A increased the autophagy incidence. TGF-b1 partly reversed the increased autophagy incidence in\nthe AF cells pretreated with 3-MA or Baf A. (B) Flow cytometric measurements for the apoptosis incidence. 3-MA increased, while Baf A decreased the apoptosis incidence.\nTGF-b1 significantly reduced the apoptosis incidence and partly reversed the increased apoptosis incidence in the AF cells pretreated with 3-MA, while further reduced the\ndecreased apoptosis incidence in the AF cells pretreated with Baf A. Western blot evaluation for the protein expressions of autophagic markers (C) and apoptotic markers (D).\n3-MA increased the expressions of Beclin-1, LC3 II/I, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2, while Baf A decreased the expression of cleaved caspase-3, had no effect on Beclin-1,\nand actually increased the expressions of LC3II/I and Bax/Bcl-2. TGF-b1 significantly decreased the expressions of Beclin-1, LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3 in the AF cells\npretreated with 3-MA or Baf A. Data were presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. AF cells cultured with vehicle under serum deprivation for 48 h were served as control. *P < 0.05 versus\ncontrol, #P < 0.05 versus cells pretreated with the corresponding autophagy modulator.\n\nB.-B.

AF cells were cultured under serum deprivation with various concentrations of\nTGF-b1 (5, 10, 20 ng/mL) for 48 h.

Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396\napoptosis incidence in the AF cells under serum starvation for 48 h\n(Fig. 3B).\n\nMeanwhile, Western blot analysis showed that 10 ng/mL of\nTGF-b1 significantly inhibited both the autophagic protein expres-\nsions of Beclin-1, LC3 II/I and the apoptotic protein expressions of\ncleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 in the AF cells under starvation for\n48 h (Fig. 3C). Real-time PCR demonstrated similar results that\n10 ng/mL of TGF-b1 significantly inhibited the mRNA expressions\nof Beclin-1 and LC3 in the AF cells under starvation for 48 h\n(Fig. 3D). In addition, immunofluorescence assay verified that\n10 ng/mL TGF-b1 significantly reduced the increased staining\nintensities for lysosomes, autolysosomes and autophagy-related\nproteins in the AF cells under serum deprivation for 48 h. Autoph-\nagy assay in GFP-LC3 transfected cells also demonstrated that\nserum deprivation increased the number of the GFP-LC3 punctate\ngreen fluorescence in the cytoplasm, which could be reduced sig-\nnificantly by 10 ng/mL TGF-b1 (Fig. 4).\n3.3. TGF-b1 protected against apoptosis through inhibition of excessive\nautophagy in AF cells under serum deprivation\n\nTo investigate the effect of TGF-b1 on the crosstalk between\nautophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under serum starvation,\nAF cells were pre-treated with 3-MA (5 mM) or Baf A (100 nM)\nfor 2 h, and cultured in serum-free DMEM with 10 ng/mL TGF-\nb1 for 48 h. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that TGF-b1 partly\nreversed the increased autophagy incidence (Fig. 2A) and\napoptosis incidence (Fig. 2B) in the AF cells pre-treated with\n3-MA. Western blot analysis revealed that TGF-b1 down-\nregulated the increased protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3\nII/I (Fig. 2C), and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 2D) in the AF cells pre-\ntreated with 3-MA. Meanwhile, flow cytometric analysis revealed\nthat TGF-b1 reversed the elevated autophagy incidence (Fig. 2A)\nand further decreased the apoptosis incidence (Fig. 2B) when\nthe cells were pre-treated with Baf A. Western blot analysis also\nfound that when the AF cells were pre-treated with the\nautophagy inhibitor Baf A, the expressions of Beclin-1 and\nLC3-II/I (Fig. 2C), cleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 (Fig. 2D) were\nall down-regulated by TGF-b1.\n\nThese results suggested that TGF-b1 could protect against apop-\ntosis through inhibition of excessive autophagy in the AF cells\nunder serum starvation.\n3.4. TGF-b1 protected AF cells against apoptosis under serum\ndeprivation through PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways\n\nTo explore whether the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling\npathways were involved in the effect of TGF-b1 on the crosstalk\nbetween autophagy and apoptosis, AF cells were pretreated with\n3-MA (an inhibitor of PI3K and p-AKT [42]), or with U0126 (an\ninhibitor of ERK1/2), and cultured in serum-free DMEM with\n10 ng/mL TGF-b1 for 48 h. Western blot analysis showed that the\nexpressions of p-AKT and p-mTOR were almost completely blocked\nby 3-MA, no matter whether TGF-b1 was administrated or not. The\nexpressions of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3 in the cells with both\nTGF-b1 and 3-MA were lower than those with 3-MA alone,\nalthough not as low as those with TGF-b1 alone (Fig. 5A). Mean-\nwhile, TGF-b1 significantly enhanced the expression of phosphory-\nlated-ERK1/2. However, when U0126 was applied, the decreased\nexpressions of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3 by TGF-b1 was partly\nup-regulated (Fig. 5B). These data indicated that the inhibitory\neffect of TGF-b1 on excessive autophagy could be weakened by\neither 3-MA or U0126. Thus, both the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2\nsignaling pathways were involved in the actions of TGF-b1 on\nthe crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells\nunder serum deprivation.\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Immunofluorescence assay for lysosomes, autolysosomes activity and autophagy-related proteins. AF cells were cultured under serum deprivation with vehicle or\n10 ng/mL TGF-b1 for 48 h. (A) Lyso-Tracker staining and (B) MDC staining. The AF cells had much higher staining intensity for autolysosomes and lysosomes under serum\ndeprivation than under serum cultivation. TGF-b1 significantly reduced the increased staining intensity. (C and D) Immunofluorescence analysis for the expressions of Beclin1\nand LC3. These two proteins were highly expressed and exhibited a punctuated distribution in the cytoplasm of AF cells following 48 h of serum starvation as compared with\nAF cells cultured in serum condition. TGF-b1 significantly reduced their expressions. (E) Fluorescent microscopy for the formation and distribution of GFP-LC3 punctate. GFP-\nLC3 plasmid transfected AF cells were incubated with vehicle or 10 ng/mL TGF-b1 under serum deprivation for 48 h. The transfected AF cells showed a higher level of punctate\ngreen fluorescence under serum deprivation than under serum condition. TGF-b1 significantly reduced the number of GFP-LC3 punctate in the cells. *P < 0.05, #P < 0.05.\n\nB.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396 93\n4. Discussion\n\nAs in our previous study [35], the existence of autophagy and\napoptosis was confirmed in the AF cells under serum starvation\nby the present study. Autophagy increased significantly in the cells\nas early as 12 h after serum starvation and reached its highest level\nat 48 h, while gradual increase of apoptosis happened only after\n24 h. When autophagy was moderately increased, apoptosis of\nthe cells maintained at a low level. When autophagy was stimu-\nlated to an extremely high level, apoptosis of the cells increased.\nThus, early and moderate autophagy was beneficial to the survival\nof the AF cells, while late and excessive autophagy led to death of\nthe AF cells. This inter-relationship between autophagy and apop-\ntosis in the AF cells was in accordance with most studies in other\ncell types [43,44].\n\nAutophagy and apoptosis are closely linked. Numerous studies\nverified the existence of complicated crosstalk between apoptosis\nand autophagy in different cell types under different cultivation\nconditions [12,45,46]. Autophagy and apoptosis are two main pro-\ngrammed cell death patterns, and both of them had an essential\nrole in the process of IVDD [24,47]. Our findings about the interac-\ntions between autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells would be\nhelpful for better understanding the molecular mechanisms impli-\ncated in the pathogenesis of IVDD.\n\nStudies reported that TGF-b1 was involved in the regulation\nof autophagy and had pro-apoptosis [30,32,33,48] or anti-apoptosis\n[19] effect in various cell types. But, to our knowledge, there is\nno relevant research focusing on the effect of TGF-b1 on the\ncrosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis in the intervertebral\ndisc cells. Our present study demonstrated that 10 ng/mL\nTGF-b1 significantly decreased the enhanced autophagy and\napoptosis caused by 48-h serum deprivation in the AF cells.\nHowever, when the excessive autophagy flux was further exacer-\nbated, the role of TGF-b1 to down-regulate apoptosis was\nimpaired. When the excessive autophagy flux was suppressed,\nthe role of TGF-b1 to down-regulate apoptosis was promoted.\nThus, the above data suggested that TGF-b1 protected against\napoptosis through inhibition of excessive autophagy in the AF\ncells under serum starvation. Previous researches found that\nthe expression of TGF-b1 was significantly up-regulated in the\nearly stage of disc degeneration [49], increased with the\npathological grades of disc degeneration [50] and could delay\nintervertebral disc degeneration via regulating the extracellular\nmatrix production [51]. Thus, our findings about the effect of\nTGF-b1 on the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy\nin the intervertebral disc cells should be helpful to better\nunderstand the molecular mechanism for the involvement of\nTGF-b1 in the process of disc degeneration.\n\n3-MA and Baf A were autophagy regulators commonly used in\nnumerous studies for different kinds of cells. Consistent with pre-\nvious reports [19,52], Baf A actually increased the autophagy inci-\ndence and elevated the expression of LC3 II/I in our study, although\n\n\n\nFig. 5. TGF-b1 protected AF cells against apoptosis through inhibiting autophagy via PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. (A) Western blot for the expression of\nT-AKT, p-AKT, T-mTOR, p-mTOR, and LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. Cells were cultured in complete serum-free DMEM with 10 ng/mL TGF-b1, or with 5 mM 3-MA, or with\nboth of these two for 48 h. 3-MA could evidently abrogate the TGF-b1 induced phosphorylation of both AKT and mTOR and partly reduced the inhibitory effect of TGF-b1 on\nthe expression of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. (B) Western blot for the expressions of T-ERK, p-ERK, LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. AF cells were cultured in complete\nserum-free DMEM with 10 ng/mL TGF-b1, or with 10 lM U0126, or with both of these two for 48 h. TGF-b1 could significantly enhance the expression of p-ERK1/2 and\nsimultaneously inhibited the expressions of LC3 II/I and cleaved caspase-3. U0126 partly reversed this inhibitory effect of TGF-b1. AF cells pretreated with vehicles and then\ncultured under serum deprivation for 48 h were served as control. *P < 0.05 versus control, #P < 0.05 versus cells pretreated with the corresponding modulator.\n\n94 B.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396\nit is an autophagy inhibitor. The proper explanation was that Baf A\ninhibited the fusion of autophagosomes/lysosomes and decreased\nthe autophagic degradation, thus blocking the downstream step\nin the autophagy flux. Thus, increased accumulation of autophago-\nsomes led to increased autophagy incidence measured by flow\ncytometry for AO staining and elevated expression of LC3 II/I\ndetected by Western blot. Meanwhile, 3-MA was often used as\nan autophagy inhibitor by inhibiting the class III PI3K [42] and\nsuppressing autophagy [53]. However, we found that 3-MA\nactually promoted autophagy in AF cells under serum deprivation\nin vitro. Increased protein expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3 II/I\nand increased autophagy incidence were found in the AF cells\npre-treated with\n3-MA. Although the accurate mechanism of 3-MA on promoting\nautophagy was not clear, a similar finding was reported that\n3-MA promoted autophagy because of its persistent inhibition on\nclass I PI3K, but transient suppression on class III PI3K [40].\n\nIts well known that apoptosis could be induced by variant\nupstream stimuli [54] and caspase-3 was a major protease\nexecuting apoptosis [55]. Cleaved caspase-3 could be activated\nby cytochrome C released from mitochondria, which was pro-\nmoted by Bax or inhibited by Bcl-2 [56\u201358]. Our results revealed\nthat both Baf A and 3-MA increased the expression of Bax/Bcl-2\nin the AF cells under serum deprivation. One possible reason was\nthat autophagy was closely connected with the mitochondrial\nfunction [59\u201361], and inhibition of autophagy with Baf A led to\nthe unexpected high expression of Bax/Bcl-2. We also found that\nTGF-b1 could down regulate the high expression of Bax/Bcl-2 in\nthe AF cells pretreated with Baf A, but not in the cells with\n3-MA. We speculated that TGF-b1 could re-establish the mitochon-\ndrial function when the last step of autophagy was inhibited by Baf\nA, but failed to re-establish the mitochondrial function when the\nautophagy was promoted by 3-MA. Furthermore, Baf A resulted\nin a decrease of cleaved caspase-3, although it did not reduce\nBax/Bcl-2 expression in our study, suggesting that Baf A reduced\napoptosis via nonmitochondrial apoptotic pathway.\n\nThese findings proved our hypothesis that TGF-b1 protected AF\ncells from apoptosis through down-regulating autophagy. The\nmitochondrial pathway might be involved in this process.\n\nMammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was the key upstream\nregulator of autophagy-related proteins [62]. Abundance of\nnutrients, including growth factors, glucose, and amino acids acti-\nvate mTOR and suppress autophagy, whereas nutrient deprivation\ncould inhibit mTOR and promote autophagy [21,63]. PI3K/AKT lay\nupstream of mTOR, and activated AKT inhibited autophagy through\nactivating mTOR [64\u201366]. It has been reported that TGF-b1 could\nactivate AKT in various cell types [19,67,68]. In our present study,\nwe found that TGF-b1 significantly up-regulated the phosphoryla-\ntion of AKT and mTOR and down-regulated autophagy in the AF\ncells under serum deprivation. When the signaling pathway\nPI3K/AKT/mTOR was blocked by 3-MA, TGF-b1 lost part of its\ndown-regulating function on autophagy and apoptosis. These find-\nings proved our hypothesis that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling\npathway was involved in the effect of TGF-b1 on the crosstalk\nbetween autophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under serum\ndeprivation.\n\n\n\nB.-B. Ni et al. / Cytokine 70 (2014) 87\u201396 95\nMAPK\u2013ERK is one of the mitochondrial signaling pathway and it\nhas been reported that the MAPK\u2013ERK signaling pathway could\nregulate the expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes [69]\nand TGF-b1 could activate the phosphorylation of ERK [70,71]. As\nexpected, our study further demonstrated that TGF-b1 could signif-\nicantly enhance the expression of phosphorylated-ERK1/2 and\nsimultaneously inhibited the expression of LC3 II/I and cleaved cas-\npase-3. When the ERK signaling pathway was blocked with U0126,\nTGF-b1 lost part of its down-regulating function on autophagy.\nThese results confirmed that the MAPK\u2013ERK1/2 signaling pathway\nwas involved in the effect of TGF-b1 on the crosstalk between\nautophagy and apoptosis in the AF cells under serum deprivation,\nwhich further confirmed that the impact of TGF-b1 was through\nmitochondrial signaling pathway.\n\nWe realized that there were several limitations in our present\nstudy. Activation or inhibition of autophagy was through the use\nof chemical modulators in this study. The efficiency of these mod-\nulators was not the best. Gene silencing or overexpression tech-\nnique would be better. The crosstalk between autophagy and\napoptosis of the intervertebral disc cells under variant stress con-\nditions and its significance in the pathogenesis of IVDD need to\nbe further investigated.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe current study demonstrated that TGF-b1 could protect\nagainst the apoptosis of AF cells under serum deprivation through\ndown-regulating excessive autophagy. PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR and\nMAPK\u2013ERK1/2 were the possible signaling pathways involved in\nthis process. These findings should be helpful for us to better\nunderstand the molecular mechanisms involved in the action of\nTGF-b1 for AF cells and should be of clinical significance for the\nprevention and treatment of IVDD.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Founda-\ntion of China (81171757, 81000793) and funds from the Commis-\nsion of Science Technology of Shanghai (11JC1408500).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Frymoyer JW, Cats-Baril WL.
