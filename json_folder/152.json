The\nGoIL-2 shows, respectively, 79%, 82e85%, and 91e92% identities with TuIL-2, ChIL-2 and DuIL-2 in cDNA, and also\nshows, respectively, 63%, 63e64%, and 82e85% identities with TuIL-2, ChIL-2 and DuIL-2 in amino acid sequence. Recombinant\nGoIL-2 (rGoIL-2) protein expressed in Escherichia coli has an approximate molecular weight of 18 kDa. The rGoIL-2 has biological\neffect on goose and duck as well as chicken lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, though the effect on duck and chicken\nlymphocytes has been found to be relatively weak. In addition, rGoIL-2 also strengthens goose immune responses induced by\n\nvaccinating the inactivated oil emulsion vaccine against avian influenza virus. The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to rGoIL-2\nrecognized the binding epitopes of nature GoIL-2 protein expressed in vero cells. Antiserum and mAb 5B10 to rGoIL-2 can inhibit\nthe biological activity of rGoIL-2 and endogenous GoIL-2. The results, at the first time, indicated that goose IL-2 reserves species-\nspecialties in the biological functions and can be used as a potential immunoadjuvant for goose vaccination and immunotherapeutic\n\npurposes. Finally, the mAbs to rGoIL-2 also provide a useful tool for further immunobiological studies of IL-2 in avian immune\nsystems.\n\ufffd 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nIL-2 is a glycoprotein produced principally by\nactivated T cells and some B cells and a cytokine that\nregulates lymphocyte function. IL-2 controls the ampli-\nfication of native T cells by initially stimulating growth\nfollowing antigen activation, and also has effects on NK\ncells, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils [1e4].\nIL-2 has been developed as an immunotherapeutic agent\nin chronic microbial infection and cancer, and as an\nenhancing agent in vaccine [5e7].

IL-2R is composed of three distinct subunits:\nIL-2Ra, IL-2Rb and IL-2Rg which are encoded, re-\nspectively, by distinct and structurally unrelated genes\n[9]. Resting T cells express low levels of IL-2Ra-subunit\n(Tac antigen) that binds to IL-2 with a low affinity.\nIL-2Rb-subunit alone or in combination with a or g\nproduce a receptor with intermediate affinity, and the\ng-subunit alone does not bind IL-2, while a receptor\ncomprised of three subunits offers the highest affinity for\nIL-2 [8].\n\nUp to now, in addition to human IL-2, IL-2 genes for\nmore than 30 animal species also have been cloned and\nidentified [10]. Recently, IL-2 gene for chicken (ChIL-2)\nand turkey (TuIL-2) have been cloned and sequenced\n\nmailto:jyzhou@zju.edu.cn\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n329J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338\nsuccessfully [11e13]. The ChIL-2 gene is mapped to\nchromosome 4, linked to annexin V with synteny with\nmouse chromosome 3 and human chromosome 4 [12].\nOur previous study revealed that some variations exist in\nthe open reading frame (ORF) of ChIL-2 from different\nchicken breeds [14]. The cDNAcoding forChIL-2 protein\nwas introduced into several prokaryotic and eukaryotic\nexpression systems to produce biologically active re-\ncombinant cytokines [13,15,16]. ChIL-2 plays an impor-\ntant role as an immunoregulatory molecule identical to\nmammalian IL-2 and has been shown to stimulate T\nlymphoblast cells, increase the proportion of both CD4\n\nC\n\nandCD8\nC\nperipheral bloodT cells [17], enhanceNK cells\n\nactivity and vaccine response to Eimeria parasites [18],\nand strengthen the protective immunity against infectious\nbursal disease virus [19], indicating that ChIL-2 has\npractical importance in potentially enhancing immune\nresponses to vaccines and infectious agents in poultry.\nFurthermore, mAbs to ChIL-2 have also been produced,\nand used to study the biological activities of ChIL-2\n[20,21]. Comparatively, little work has been performed on\navian IL-2s and their receptors. Only a mAb designated\nINN-CH-16 can react with a 48e50 kDa antigen ex-\npressed on activated chicken T lymphocytes and inhibited\nthe proliferation of Con A-stimulated blasts in response\nto supernatants of stimulated chicken T cells. These\nfeatures led to the hypothesis that INN-CH-16 may\nrecognize the ChIL-2R [22,23].\n\nAs for waterfowl cytokines in 1997, Bertram et al.\n[24] found lymphokines released by duck peripheral\nblood lymphocytes and splenocytes stimulated with\nPHA, which was of similar functional homology to\nChIL-2 in maintaining the lymphocyte proliferation.\nRecently, the cloning and functional characterization of\nduck IL-2 have been reported [25e27]. However, no\ninformation was available on the goose cytokines.\nHereby, the goal of the present study was to molecularly\nclone the cDNA fragment of goose IL-2 (GoIL-2), to\nexpress the GoIL-2 open reading frame in vitro\nexpression system, to prepare mAbs to GoIL-2, and to\ndetect the bioactivity of the recombinant GoIL-2\n(rGoIL-2) protein in vitro and in vivo.\n\n2. Results\n\n2.1. Molecular cloning and analysis of goose\nIL-2 cDNA\n\nThe mRNA was isolated from goose SMC stimulated\nwith 10 mg/ml Con A at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 48\nand 72 h. GoIL-2 cDNA fragment was amplified by RT-\nPCR using these mRNAs as templates. An approxi-\nmately 0.8 kb DNA fragment, in size, was amplified\nfrom nine of the 12 mRNAs (Fig. 1). The sequencing\nresults revealed that cDNA fragment of GoIL-2 was\n718 nt in length (GenBank accession no. AY392557).\nGoIL-2 cDNA fragment encodes a polypeptide of 141\namino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of\n16.29 kDa. Analysis of the signal peptide revealed that\nthere was a potential cleavage site between amino acid\nresidues 21 and 22 (arrow in Fig. 2). The predicted signal\npeptide of GoIL-2 was similar in size to that of\nmammalian animals (20 aa) and other birds (22 aa).\n\nThe deduced amino acid sequence of GoIL-2 was\ncompared with those of the several avian andmammalian\nspecies. The alignment analysis showed that GoIL-2\nshared 85% identity to DuIL-2 (GenBank accession\nno. AY193713), 63% to ChIL-2 (GenBank accession no.\nAF294321), 64% to TuIL-2 (GenBank accession\nno. AJ007463), 9% to human IL-2 (GenBank accession\nno. U25676), and 7e20% to other mammalian IL-2s. As\nshown in Fig. 2, in IL-2 sequences of the compared avian\nspecies, there are 78 conserved amino acid residues\nincluding three cysteine residues (position 63, 70 and\n119), indicating that there is at least one di-sulfate bond in\nthe molecules. However, Lys\n\n48\nandAsn\n\n80\nare present only\n\nin GoIL-2 amino acid sequence. Thr\n34,45,114\n\n, Lys\n73,105\n\n,\nIle\n\n75,110\n, Asp\n\n86,90\n, Glu\n\n104\nand Arg\n\n132\nare the conserved\n\namino acid residues in goose and duck IL-2s, but are\nvariable in chicken and turkey IL-2s. On the contrary,\nfour amino acid residues (Ala\n\n14\n, Ile\n\n42\n, His\n\n51\nand Leu\n\n131\n)\n\nwere conserved in chicken and turkey IL-2s, but were\nvariable in goose and duck IL-2s. Phylogenetic analysis\n(Fig. 3) shows further that the avian IL-2s were\nsubdivided into two monophyletic lineages. The goose\nand duck IL-2s formed a monophyletic group distinct\nfrom ChIL-2 and TuIL-2, confirming the similarity\nbetween duck and goose IL-2s.\n\n2.2. Expression and purification of the\nHis-GoIL-2 fusion protein\n\nThe gene fragment encoding GoIL-2 protein (without\nsignal peptide) was cloned into the pBAD/His B\nexpression vector, where the araB promoter is controlled\nby arabinose.

Production and identification of\nmAbs specific for GoIL-2\n\nFollowing immunization with rGoIL-2 protein puri-\nfied under denaturing conditions as an immunogen, five\nmurine hybridoma clones were identified to produce\nmAbs (3B2, 5B10, 3C4, 5D4 and 2F7). Data in Table 1\nshowed that all these mAbs recognized rGoIL-2 by\nELISA and Western blot assays. The mAbs did not\nreact with 6!Histamine, rChIL-2 or with rDuIL-2.\nIsotype of the five mAbs was found to be all IgG1 and k\nchain. Rabbit antiserum against rGoIL-2 produced as\ndescribed in Section 4.4 could also specifically react with\nrGoIL-2, but do not react with any protein in the cell\nlysate of Escherichia coli LMG194 strain transformed\nwith empty pBAD/His B (data not shown).\n\n2.4. Eukaryotic expression of GoIL-2\n\nIn order to express the GoIL-2 protein in the\neukaryotic cells, pEGFP-GoIL-2 plasmid was trans-\nfected into vero cells. As shown in Fig. 5b, the EGFP-\nGoIL-2 expressed in vero cells as early as 3 h after\ntransfection. In immunocytochemical staining, the\nacetone-fixed pEGFP-GoIL-2-transfected vero cells\nwere detected, respectively, by five mAbs to rGoIL-2\n(Fig. 5deh), while no signal was observed in vero cells\ntransfected with pEGFP-c2 vector (Fig. 5c), demon-\nstrating that these mAbs hold the epitopes of GoIL-2\nprotein expressed in vero cells.\n\n2.5. In vitro bioactivity of goose IL-2\n\nThe concentration of the E. coli-derived soluble\nrGoIL-2 in the protein preparation was 0.656 mg/ml.\nThe biological activity of E. coli-derived rGoIL-2 and\nendogenous GoIL-2 was tested by in vitro proliferation\nof goose, duck and chicken spleen cells. Goose\n(5! 106 cells/well), duck (5! 106 cells/well) and chicken\n(5! 106 cells/well) spleen cells were cultured in the\npresence of either rGoIL-2, irrelevant protein control,\nRPMI-1640eFCS or the supernatants from Con A-\nstimulated SMC in a series of 2-fold dilutions. Data in\nFig. 6A showed that 1.6 ng rGoIL-2/well can significantly\nstimulate in vitro proliferation of goose lymphocytes,\nwhile rGoIL-2 was 6.3 ng/well for duck lymphocytes\nand 25 ng/well for chicken lymphocytes. These results\nindicated that the stimulation effect of rGoIL-2 on both\nchicken and duck lymphocytes was weak. On the other\nhand, 0.8 ng/well rChIL-2 was needed in the proliferation\nassay of chicken lymphocytes and 12.5 ng rChIL-2/well\nfor duck lymphocytes and 6.3 ng rChIL-2/well for goose\nlymphocytes (Fig. 6B). 6.3 ng/well rDuIL-2 induces\nsignificantly in vitro proliferation of duck lymphocytes\nFig. 5.

Neither the protein control from E. coli\nLMG194 strain transfected with pBAD/His B vector\nalone, nor the RPMI-1640eFCS could stimulate the\nproliferation of activated goose, duck and chicken\nlymphocytes.\n\n2.6. Ability of mAbs to neutralize the biological\nactivity of recombinant and endogenous IL-2\n\nFive mAbs and one pAb to rGoIL-2 were tested for\ntheir ability to neutralize the biological function of the\nrecombinant and endogenous GoIL-2 as measured by\nthe inhibition of Con A-stimulated lymphocyte pro-\nliferation. Only mAb 5B10 and pAb exhibited neutral-\nizing activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). mAb\n5B10 neutralized 85% of the lymphocyte-stimulating\nactivity of rGoIL-2 and 80% for endogenous GoIL-2.\nThe inhibiting effect of pAb on the activity of rGoIL-2\nand endogenous GoIL-2 was found to be 100%.\n\n2.7. In vivo immune response to AIV vaccine induced\nby rGoIL-2\n\nFollowing the intramuscular inoculations with the\nrGoIL-2 and the inactivated oil emulsion AIV vaccine,\nblood samples were collected at specified times and the\nserum HI antibody to AIV was measured. As shown in\nTable 2, in gooses injected intramuscularly with both\nrGoIL-2 protein (300 ng or 350 ng per goose, respec-\ntively) and AIV vaccine 2 weeks after immunization, the\naverage titers of HI antibodies to AIV reached 6.3e6.4\nlog 2, while the average titers of HI antibody to AIV\nwere 5.2e5.3 log 2 in gooses only vaccinated with AIV\nvaccine or with both 250 ng rGoIL-2 and AIV vaccine.\nThe results clearly showed that 300 ng rGoIL-2 per\ngoose strengthened in vivo immune responses induced\nby the inactivated oil emulsion AIV vaccine.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nUp to date, information about goose IL-2 has not\nbeen available. Recently, the cloning and functional\ncharacterization of chicken, turkey and duck IL-2s have\nbeen reported [11e15,17,25e27]. The amino acid identity\namongst these avian IL-2s was up to 58e73%. In this\nreport, the goose IL-2 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR\nusing primers based on the highly conserved regions\namong chicken, turkey and duck IL-2s. We found that\nGoIL-2mRNAwas undetectable usingRT-PCR in goose\nSMC 1 h and 72 h after Con A stimulation, but was\ndetected in all samples from 2 h to 48 h after stimulation,\nshowing that GoIL-2 expression began 1 h after stimula-\ntion and stopped 72 h after stimulation. Sundick et al. [11]\ndetected the ChIL-2 mRNA 5 h after stimulation with\nConA. Inmitogen-stimulatedmouse spleen cells, the IL-2\ngene is only transiently expressed with maximal mRNA\nsteady state levels between 6e14 h post-stimulation [28].\nIL-2 mRNA expression of northern elephant seal peaked\nin the first 8 h following Con A stimulation [29].\n\nWhether rGoIL-2 protein expressed in E. coli pos-\nsessed a biological function, we measured the bioactivity\nof GoIL-2 protein using in vitro lymphocyte proliferation\nand in vivo immune responses of AIV vaccine vaccina-\ntion. As little as 1.6 ng/well of rGoIL-2 could significantly\nstimulate in vitro proliferation of goose lymphocytes\nwhile 6.3 ng rGoIL-2/well was needed for duck lympho-\ncytes and 25 ng rGoIL-2/well for chicken lymphocytes\nwere need (Fig. 6A). In addition, after each goose was\nintramuscularly vaccinated with a dose of 300e350 ng\nrGoIL-2, the vaccinated gooses reveal strengthening\nimmune responses to AIV vaccine immunization. These\ndata suggested that rGoIL-2 had biological effects,\nthough the effect on duck and chicken lymphocytes was\nrelatively weak. These evidences mentioned above led\nto sufficient support that functional similarity existed\nbetween goose and duck as well as chicken IL-2\nmolecules. Furthermore, these results implied that the\nrGoIL-2 was an important immunoregulatory molecule\nwell-studied in chicken and mammalian counterparts\n[30e33]. Similarly, an in vitro proliferation of chicken,\nduck and goose lymphocytes induced byChIL-2 aswell as\nDuIL-2 was similar to that of GoIL-2 (Fig. 6B and C).\nThe result further demonstrated that the effect of\nrGoIL-2, rChIL-2 and rDuIL-2 was dose dependent\nand certain species-specialties existed. Previous reports\nshowed that there was certain species-characteristic\n\n\n\n333J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338\n\n\n\n334 J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338\nFig. 7. Neutralizing activity of anti-IL-2 Abs in goose IL-2 lymphocyte proliferation assay induced by rGoIL-2 and supernatant of 24 h Con A-\n\nstimulated goose SMC. Concentration of mAb 5B10 used was 30 ng/ml, and that of polyclonal antibody was 3 mg/ml. Non-immunized rabbit serum\n\nand mAb to spike protein of IBV [40] were used as negative controls. Cells without addition of any antibody were used as background control. Values\n\nare expressed as mean countsG standard error.\nbetween IL-2 from cells of various species [34e38]. The\nproliferative response of human lymphocytes to recombi-\nnant porcine IL-2 was only 50% of that seen with\nrecombinant HuIL-2 [38]. Recombinant ovine IL-2 was\nable to stimulate the proliferation of bovine lymphocytes\nbut not porcine lymphocytes. It was not surprising that\nthere was 97% amino acid identity between the ovine and\nbovine proteins while the amino acid identity between\novine and porcine IL-2 was 73%. Both ovine and bovine\nIL-2 amino acid residues involved in the binding to the\nhuman equivalents of the IL-2Ra (p55) and IL-2Rb (p75)\nsubunits showed further that both these two domains of\nthe ligand were entirely conserved [34,38]. Comparison of\nthe ovine and porcine IL-2 amino acid sequences revealed\nthat six of the 25 residues involved in binding to the IL-\n2Ra (p55) were different. As for the IL-2Rb (p75) binding\ndomain, five of the 10 amino acid residues were different.\nHence, the amino acid residues in the two receptor\nbinding domains were less conserved between ovine and\nporcine IL-2 compared with the ovine and bovine IL-2\n[39].\n\nIn our study, five mAbs specific for rGoIL-2\nwere produced. Anti-GoIL-2 mAbs do not recognize\nrDuIL-2 and rChIL-2 proteins. While the E. coli-derived\nrGoIL-2 could be recognized by mAbs 5H6 and 5F6\nto rDuIL-2, indicating that five anti-GoIL-2 mAbs\nrecognized a conserved epitope in the duck and chicken\nmolecules. And mAbs 5H6 and 5F6 to rDuIL-2\nrecognized conserved epitopes in duck and goose\nmolecules. Furthermore, all mAb to E. coli-derived\nGoIL-2 reacted specifically with EGFP-GoIL-2 protein\nexpressed in vero cells, evincing that the five mAbs\nremained the binding epitopes of nature GoIL-2.\nHowever, in neutralizing assay, only one of the five mAbs\n(mAb 5B10) was able to neutralize the activity of rGoIL-2\nand endogenous GoIL-2 in Con A-induced lymphocyte\nproliferation assay, indicating that only mAb 5B10 reacts\nwith the functional domain of GoIL-2 protein.\n\n4. Materials and methods\n\n4.1. Animals\n\nThe embryonated eggs of Eastern Zhejiang White\ngoose (Xiangshan institute of Eastern Zhejiang White\ngoose, China) and Muscovy duck (Yuyao Shennong\npoultry Co. Ltd., Zhejiang, China) were hatched at our\nlaboratory, and reared in a special room with unlimited\naccess to feed and water and used at 30 days. Thirty day-\nold specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Leghorn chickens were\nobtained from Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal\nTechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China. Four week-old\nBALB/c mice were purchased from Shanghai Labora-\ntory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences,\nShanghai, China. New Zealand white rabbits (NZW\nFig. 6.

All\nlaboratory animals and animal subjects used in this\nstudy have been approved by the scientific ethical\ncommittee of the Zhejiang University.\n\n4.2. RNA isolation, RT-PCR and sequencing\n\nGoose splenicmononuclear cells (SMC)were prepared\nas previously described by Zhou et al. [14]. SMC\nstimulated with Con A for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24,\n48 and 72 h were harvested, respectively. Total cellular\nmRNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL,\nGaithersburg, MD). Primers were designed according to\nthe conserved cDNA sequence for DuIL-2, ChIL-2 and\nTuIL-2 (GenBank accession no. AF294323, AF017645\nand AJ007463, respectively). Sense primer (5#-AATAC-\nTAGCACAGACAACCAG-3#) corresponded nt posi-\ntions 59e81. Antisense primer (5#-TTACTGAAAGAT-\nTTATTAAATATCATCTA-3#) was complementary to\nnt positions 798e824. The cDNAs were synthesized from\ntotal cellular RNA using the antisense primer. PCR was\nconducted with sense and antisense primers under the\nconditions consisting of 30 cycles of denaturation at\n95 \ufffdC for 1 min, primer annealing at 45 \ufffdC for 45 s and\nDNA extension at 72 \ufffdC for 2 min. The final DNA\nextension was carried out at 72 \ufffdC for 10 min. RT-PCR\nproducts were detected in 1% agarose gel. RT-PCR\nproduct was sequenced. The predicted amino acid\nsequence of GoIL-2 protein was compared with that of\navian and mammalian IL-2s from GenBank using\nDNASTAR 5.0 software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison,\nWI, USA). Putative Signal peptide of GoIL-2 protein\nwas determined using prediction servers at http://\nwww.cbs.dtu.dk./services/.\n\n4.3. Expression and purification of recombinant\nGoIL-2\n\nBased on the cDNA sequence of the above-men-\ntioned GoIL-2, the GoIL-2 ORF without the putative\nsignal peptide sequence was obtained by PCR using the\nupstream primer 5#-GCGAATTCGCACCTCTATCA-\n\nTable 2\n\nGoose anti-AIV (H9N2) HI antibody response induced by rGoIL-2\n\nGroup Animal\n\nNo.\n\nrGoIL-2 dose\n\n(ng/goose)\n\nSerum HI titer\n\n(log 2)\na\n\n1st\n\nweek\n\n2nd\n\nweek\n\n3rd\n\nweek\n\n4th\n\nweek\n\nVaccine 10 250 0 5.2 5.6 6.6\n\n10 300 0 6.3 6.7 7.7\n\n10 350 0 6.4 6.9 8.2\n\n10 ! 0 5.3 5.8 6.5\n\nControl 10 ! 0 0 0 0\n\na\nHI titer was geometry mean titer.\nGAGAA-3# containing the EcoRI site and the down-\nstream primer 5#-GCAAGCTTTTATTTTAGCATA-\nGATCT-3# containing the HindIII site. Following\ndigestion with EcoRI and HindIII, the PCR product\nwas subcloned into the vector pBAD/His B (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA) for expression as a His-tagged protein,\nnamed as pBAD-GoIL-2. The pBAD-GoIL-2 plasmid\nwas transformed into competent E. coli LMG194 cells\n(Invitrogen) and the transformants were screened on LB\nplates for ampicillin resistance. Plasmid DNA from\nresistant colonies was identified and sequenced to\ndetermine the size and orientation of the insert. His-\nGoIL-2 expression was induced by the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocols, and checked by SDS-PAGE as described\npreviously by Zhou et al. [40]. For the purification of\nthe soluble recombinant His-GoIL-2 (rGoIL-2), the\nbacterial pellet was suspended in buffer B (100 mM\nNaH2PO4, 10 mM TriseCl, 8 M urea, pH 8.0) and lysed\nthoroughly by sonication on ice. The lysate was\ncentrifuged at 10,000! g for 20 min at room tempera-\nture (RT). Then the supernatant was collected and\napplied to a nickel column (Qiagen) to purify histidine-\ntagged proteins according to the manufacturer\u2019s in-\nstructions. The concentration of the purified rGoIL-2\nwas determined spectroscopically at 595 nm using a\nprotein assay kit based on the Bradford reagent (Biorad,\nHercules, CA). Western blot analysis of the expressed\nrGoIL-2 protein was checked as previously described by\nZhou et al. [40] with anti-X-press\ufffd mAb (Invitrogen),\nanti-human IL-2 mAb (Bender Medsystem Gmbh,\nAustria), and anti-DuIL-2 mAbs [26], anti-mouse\nIL-2 mAb (R&D systems Inc., U.S.A), anti-ChIL-2\nmAbs [41].\n\nTo prepare native soluble His-GoIL-2 for prolifera-\ntion assay, the bacterial pellet was washed with PBS (pH\n7.2) for three times and resuspended in lysis buffer\n(50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM\nimidazole) at 2e5 ml per gram wet weight with 0.01%\nTriton-X 100, frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed entirely\nunder 37 \ufffdC water bath and sonicated on ice for three\n30 s pulses with intervening 20 s pauses. The lysed cells\nwere centrifuged at 10,000! g for 20 min at 4 \ufffdC. The\nrGoIL-2 was purified under native conditions from the\nresulting supernatant by the above-mentioned nickel\ncolumn. The purified rGoIL-2 was dialyzed against PBS,\nconcentrated using the PEG 6000. Polymixin B Sephar-\nose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used to remove LPS\nfrom the purified proteins. The bacterial protein from\nE. coli LMG194 strain transformed with empty pBAD/\nHis B vector were prepared and used as protein control.\n\n4.4. Production and characterization of monoclonal\nand polyclonal antibodies to GoIL-2\n\nMAbs specific for rGoIL-2 were obtained by immu-\nnizingmice with purified rGoIL-2 as described previously\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nhttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk./services/\nhttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk./services/\n\n\n336 J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338\n[26,40]. Briefly, the spleen cells isolated from immunized\nmice were fused with the sp2/0 myeloma cells by standard\nmethods. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for\nspecific binding to rGoIL-2 by the indirect ELISA as\ndescribed earlier [19], using 6!His, cell lysate of E. coli\nLMG194, rDuIL-2 [26], rChIL-2 [41] and rGoIL-2 as\nantigens. Hybridomas secreting mAbs to GoIL-2 were\nisolated and cloned by limiting dilution for acites\nproduction. The isotypes of the mAbs were determined\nusing a commercial kit (Southern Biotechnology Asso-\nciates, Inc., Birmingham, AL 35260, USA). Western blot\nanalysis of mAbs to rGoIL-2 was screened as the above-\nmentioned method.\n\nAnti-rGoIL-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) was\ngenerated by bi-weekly immunization of NZW rabbits\nwith rGoIL-2-CFA emulsion (100 mg of rGoIL-2 per\nrabbit). Immunized rabbits were bled 14 days after last\ninjection and the serum was collected.\n\n4.5. Preparation of endogenous GoIL-2 protein\n\nThe suspensions of the goose SMC were prepared as\nthe method mentioned above. Goose SMC were diluted\nto 1! 107 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FCS\nand 10 mg/ml Con A, and incubated at 40 \ufffdC in 5% CO2\nfor 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48,72 and 96 h. At each time point,\nthe residual Con A was moved by incubating with 0.1 M\na-methyl-D-mannoside (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,\nUSA) for 30 min and the supernatant was harvested by\ncentrifugation at 10,000! g for 10 min at 4 \ufffdC.\n\n4.6. Antigen (Ag)-capture ELISA for GoIL-2\n\nFor quantification of rGoIL-2 expressed in E. coli\nand endogenous GoIL-2 in supernatants from Con A-\nstimulated SMC, an Ag-capture ELISA was developed\nwith certain modifications as described previously [20].\nBriefly mAbs and pAb to GoIL-2 were purified by fast\nprotein liquid chromatography (AmershamePharmacia\nBiotech, Piscataway, NJ), and rGoIL-2 purified under\ndenaturing conditions was used as a reference protein.\nNinety-six-well flat-bottom plates (NUNC, Denmark)\nwere coated with mAb (10 mg/ml, 100 ml/well) to GoIL-2\nin 0.1 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 at 37 \ufffdC for 1 h\nfollowed at 4 \ufffdC overnight. Each well was blocked with\n200 ml PBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h at RT followed\nby three washes with 0.05 M PBST (PBS containing\n0.01% Tween 20). One hundred microlitres of culture\nsupernatant from Con A-stimulated SMC or protein\npreparations containing rGoIL-2 was added to each well\nand incubated for 4 h at RT. pAb to rGoIL-2 (100 ml/\nwell) in PBSe0.1% BSA was added and incubated for\n1 h at RT after five washes. After incubation with HRP-\nlabeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry\nLaboratories, Inc., Maryland, USA) for 30 min at RT.\nPeroxidase activity was detected by adding 100 ml/well\nof o-phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml in 0.05 M PBS, pH\n5.0) substrate (Sigma) incubated for 15 min, and re-\naction was stopped by the addition of 50 ml of 2 M\nsulfate acid. Reactions were monitored by an automated\nmicrotiter plate reader at 490 nm.\n\n4.7. Construction of eukaryotic expression vector,\ntransfection and immunocytochemical staining\n\nThe GoIL-2 ORF with the signal peptide sequence\nwas amplified by PCR using the upstream primer\n5#-GCGAATTCATGATGTGCAAAGTACTGATC3-#\ncontaining the EcoRI site and downstream primer\n5#-TTGGATCCTTTTTGCAGATATCTCAC-3# con-\ntaining the BamHI site. The PCR product was subcloned\ninto the pEGFP-c2 plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech,\nPalo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions. The resulting plasmid pEGFP-GoIL-2 was trans-\nfected into the vero cells which had been seeded into\n24-well plates (1! 105 cells/well) using a commercially\navailable lipofectamine 2000 (2.5 mg/ml, Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA) in Opti-MEM medium (Gibco). The cells\nwere examinedunder an inverted fluorescencemicroscope\n3 h post-transfection. Then the cells were fixed with 80%\ncold acetone at \ufffd20 \ufffdC. After washing three times with\nPBS, the cells were blocked for 1 h at 37 \ufffdCwith 5% skim\nmilk and 0.1%Triton-X 100 in PBST. The cells were then\nincubated with the mAbs to rGoIL-2 diluted in PBST\ncontaining 2% skim milk for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC. Washed three\ntimes with PBST, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC\nwith HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard &\nPerry Laboratories). Color development was carried out\nwith 9-aminoethyl carbazole (Sigma) and hydrogen\nperoxide in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The\ncell expressed GoIL-2 was stained reddish-brown in this\nassay.\n\n4.8. Bioassay and neutralization\n\nLymphocyte proliferation induced by rGoIL-2 was\ndetected by MTT test [42]. Briefly, SMC from the\nchickens, ducks and gooses were, respectively, sus-\npended at 1! 107 cells/ml in RPMI-1640eFCS con-\ntaining 10 mg/ml Con A, and incubated at 40 \ufffdC in 5%\nCO2 for 24 h. SMC stimulated by Con A for 24 h were\nincubated in RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.1 M\na-methyl-D-mannoside (Sigma) at 40 \ufffdC for 30 min.\nThe cells were applied to Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) and\nlive cells were selected after centrifugation. The enriched\nviable cell population was resuspended in RPMI-1640\ncontaining 10% FCS and cultured at 5! 106 cells/ml\nwith the supernatant containing endogenous GoIL-2 as\nwell as rGoIL-2 proteins in triplicates in 96-well micro-\ntiter plates (100 ml/well, Costar, Corning, NY, USA).\nThe cells containing RPMI-1640eFCS and protein\ncontrol from E. coli LMG194 strain transformed with\n\n\n\n337J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338\npBAD/His B vector alone were used as negative controls.\nAfter incubation at 40 \ufffdC for 48 h, 20 ml MTT (5 mg/ml)\nwas added to each well and reacted for 4 h. One hundred\nmicrolitres of lysis buffer (10% SDSe0.01 mol/l HCl)\nwas added to each well. Plates were incubated for 20 h at\n40 \ufffdC under 5% CO2 and OD value was measured at\n570 nm. ODGoIL-2/ODnegative value of 1.5 or above was\ndefined as the positive criteria for the biological activity\nof rGoIL-2.\n\nNeutralizing capacity of mAbs and pAb to rGoIL-2\nwas screened in 96-well plates as describedpreviouslywith\nmodifications [43]. Briefly, by fixing rGoIL-2 with anti-\nbodies in different concentrations, His-GoIL-2 (1.6 ng/\nwell) and supernatant of Con A-stimulated goose SMC\n(100 ml/well) was mixed, respectively, with an equal\nvolume of serial 10-fold dilutions of mAbs or pAb and\nincubated for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC. One hundred microlitres of\ncells (5! 106 cells/ml) stimulated by ConA for 24 h were\nadded to each well. Non-immunized rabbit serum and\nmAb to spike protein of IBV [40] were used as negative\ncontrols. Cultures were incubated for 48 h at 40 \ufffdC and\ncell proliferation was measured as above. The percent\nneutralizing ability of monoclonal and polyclonal anti-\nbodies against rGoIL-2 was calculated with the formula\nas described by Zhou et al. [27].\n\n4.9. Goose immunization and antibody detection\n\nForty-five day-old Eastern Zhejiang white gooses were\ndivided into five groups, with 10 gooses per group. After\nGroup 1, Group 2 and Group 3 gooses were each\nintramuscularly and, respectively, injected with a dose\nof 250 ng, 300 ng and 350 ng rGoIL-2, all gooses were\nimmunized intramuscularly with the commercial inacti-\nvated oil emulsion vaccine against avian influenza virus\naccording to the manufacture\u2019s instruction at once [AIV\n(H9N2), Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese\nAcademy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China].\nGooses in Group 4 only were each intramuscularly\nvaccinated with the inactivated AIV oil emulsion vaccine\n(H9N2), while gooses in the 5th Group were each\nintramuscularly immunized with the oil adjuvant as\na control. Under the same feeding condition, blood\nsamples were collected via wing vein puncture at 1, 2, 3\nand 4 weeks after immunization. The hemagglutinin-\ninhibition (HI) antibody titer against AIV was measured\nby the HI assay according to the manufacture\u2019s in-\nstruction (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese\nAcademy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was funded by Zhejiang Provincial Nature\nScience Foundation of China (Grant No. R303145) and\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant\nNo. 30230270).
