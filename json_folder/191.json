This is often associated with elevated expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 (eIF4E), the rate-limiting\nfactor of cap-dependent translation initiation. We report here that in human melanoma downregulation of miR-768-3p as a result\nof activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has an\nimportant role in the upregulation of eIF4E and enhancement in protein synthesis. Melanoma cells displayed increased nascent\nprotein production and elevated eIF4E expression, which was associated with the downregulation of miR-768-3p that was\npredicted to target the 30-untranslated region of the eIF4E mRNA. Overexpression of miR-768-3p led to the downregulation of the\nendogenous eIF4E protein, reduction in nascent protein synthesis and inhibition of cell survival and proliferation. These effects\nwere efficiently reversed when eIF4E was co-overexpressed in melanoma cells. On the other hand, introduction of anti-miR-768-3p\ninto melanocytes upregulated endogenous eIF4E protein expression and increased global protein synthesis. Downregulation of\nmiR-768-3p appeared to be mediated by activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, in that treatment of BRAFV600E melanoma cells with\nthe mutant BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 or exposure of either BRAFV600E or wild-type BRAF melanoma cells to the MEK inhibitor U0126\nresulted in the upregulation of miR-768-3p and inhibition of nascent protein synthesis. This inhibition was partially blocked in cells\ncointroduced with anti-miR-768-3p. Significantly, miR-768-3p was similarly downregulated, which was inversely associated with the\nexpression levels of eIF4E in fresh melanoma isolates. Taken together, these results identify downregulation of miR-768-3p and\nsubsequent upregulation of eIF4E as an important mechanism in addition to phosphorylation of eIF4E responsible for MEK/\nERK-mediated enhancement of protein synthesis in melanoma.\n\nOncogene (2014) 33, 2577\u20132588; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.237; published online 17 June 2013\n\nKeywords: miR-768-3p; eIF4E; mRNA translation; melanoma; RAF/MEK/ERK\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCancer cells require increased protein production to sustain their\nmalignant characteristics such as enhanced survival and prolifera-\ntion.1\u20134 The rate of mRNA translation has an important role in\nregulating protein expression and is primarily controlled at the\nstage of translation initiation.1\u20134 Initiation of translation of most\nmRNAs is mediated by the cap-dependent mechanism, whereas\ncap-independent initiation is involved in the translation of a\nsubset of mRNAs, especially under cellular stress conditions.1,3\n\nCap-dependent translation initiation is governed by the eukaryotic\ninitiation factor (eIF) 4F (eIF4F) complex that consists of the cap-\nbinding protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A and the scaffolding\nprotein eIF4G.1\u20134 Among them, eIF4E is the rate-limiting\nfactor that potentially influences the expression of almost every\nprotein in cells.1,5,6\n\nThe activity of eIF4E is regulated by its availability that is controlled\nby the eIF4E inhibitory binding proteins (4E-BPs), in particular, 4E-\nBP1.1,5,6 Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 shares the same binding motif\nwith eIF4G and thus competes with eIF4G for binding to and\nsequestering eIF4E.1,5,6 In addition, phosphorylation of eIF4E at serine\n209 upon binding to eIF4G by mitogen-activated protein kinase\nsignal-integrating kinase 1 (MNK1) and MNK2 enhances its\n\nactivity.5,7,8 Importantly, overexpression of eIF4E promotes cellular\ntransformation and tumourigenesis.9\u201311 This is associated with\nincreased translation of various mRNAs encoding cancer-promoting\nproteins.1,10\u201312 Indeed, eIF4E is expressed at increased levels in many\ntypes of cancers, such as those of the breast and colon,13\u201315 which is\noften associated with disease progression and poor prognosis of\npatients.1,13\u201315 However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the\nupregulation of eIF4E in cancer cells remains elusive.\nMicroRNAs (miRs) regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific\n\nmanner through binding to 30-untranslated regions (UTRs) of target\nmRNAs, either targeting the transcripts for degradation or blocking\ntheir translation.16,17 They can also inhibit translation by directly\ntargeting the eIF4F complex.18,19 The expression of miRs is frequently\nderegulated in cancer cells and many miRs are oncogenic or tumour\nsuppressive.17,20 In particular, a number of miRs such as miR-221/222\nand miR-149* are known to regulate melanoma cell survival or\nproliferation.21\u201325 Diverse mechanisms are involved in the regulation\nof miR expression in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner. These\ninclude genomic alterations, epigenetic changes and transcription\nfactor-mediated transactivation or repression.16,26,27\n\nA characteristic of human melanoma is oncogenic activation of\nthe mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular\n\n1Priority Research Centre for Cancer Research, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; 2School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW,\nAustralia; 3Oncology and Immunology Unit, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, Waratah, NSW, Australia; 4Department of Molecular Biology, Shanxi Cancer Hospital and Institute,\nTaiyuan, Shanxi, People\u2019s Republic of China and 5Kolling Institute for Medical Research, University of Sydney, St Leonards, NSW, Australia.

We demonstrate here that MEK/ERK-\nmediated upregulation of eIF4E is due to its inhibitory effect on\nthe expression of miR-768-3p. The latter targets eIF4E and is\ncommonly downregulated in melanoma cells.\n\nRESULTS\neIF4E is upregulated in melanoma cells\nIncreased mRNA translation has an important role in the\npathogenesis of cancer.1\u20134 In line with this, the magnitude of\nnascent protein synthesis appeared significantly increased in\ncultured melanoma cells compared with melanocytes (Figures 1a\nand b). Similarly, the relative amount of polysome-associated\nmRNA in melanoma cells was also increased (Figure 1c). This was\nassociated with increased expression and phosphorylation of the\neIF4E protein (Figures 1d and e). The elevated levels of protein\nproduction and eIF4E expression and phosphorylation in mela-\nnoma cells compared with melanocytes was not due to the\ndifferences in culture conditions, in that Mel-RM and Mel-CV cells\ngrown in melanocyte culture medium displayed even further\nincreases, albeit moderately, in protein synthesis and eIF4E\nexpression and phosphorylation. In contrast, when melanocytes\nwere switched to melanoma cell culture medium, the levels of\nprotein synthesis and eIF4E expression and phosphorylation were\nreduced (Supplementary Figure 1).\nThe role of eIF4E in increased protein synthesis in melanoma\n\ncells is confirmed by small RNA interference (siRNA) knockdown of\neIF4E, which caused marked reduction in nascent protein\nsynthesis in Mel-CV cells (Figures 1f and g). However, it displayed\nless pronounced effect in Mel-RM cells. This was conceivably due\n\nto the residual eIF4E protein that might remain adequate to drive\nmRNA translation as the endogenous eIF4E inhibitor 4E-BP1 was\nalso downregulated when eIF4E was knocked down in the cells\n(Figure 1f).32 Nonetheless, knockdown of eIF4E rendered Mel-RM\ncells more sensitive to 4EGI-1, a small molecule that inhibits the\ninteraction between eIF4E and eIF4G (Figure 1h).33 Collectively,\nthese results indicate that mRNA translation is enhanced, which is\nat least, in part, due to the upregulation of eIF4E, in melanoma\ncells.\nContrary to itsB6-fold increases at the protein level (Figure 1e),\n\nthe eIF4E transcript was elevated o2-folds and displayed\ncomparable turnover rates in melanoma cells compared with\nmelanocytes (Figures 2a and b). Moreover, the half-life time of the\neIF4E protein did not appear to prolong in melanoma cells\n(Figures 2c and d). These data suggest that translational\nupregulation may have an important role in increased expression\nof eIF4E in melanoma cells.\n\nMiR-768-3p is downregulated in melanoma cells\nWe sought to determine if miRNAs that commonly target\ntranscripts to block their translation are involved in the regulation\nof eIF4E by comparing miRNA expression profiles between\nMel-RM and Mel-CV melanoma cell lines and HEMn-MP and\nHEMn-DP melanocyte lines using TaqMan low-density array\n(Applied Biosystems, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia). Among miRNAs\nthat were differentially expressed, a decrease in miR-768-3p,\nwhose \u2018seed\u2019 region matched perfectly to a region (nucleotides\n2645\u20132652) at the 30-UTR of the eIF4E mRNA, in melanoma cells\nwas one of the most pronounced ( Genes-to-System Breast Cancer\nDatabase: http://www.itb.cnr.it/breastcancer//index.htm) (Figures\n3a and b and Supplementary Table 1). This was subsequently\nconfirmed in 10 melanoma cell lines (Figure 3c). In contrast, other\nmiRNAs that are predicted to target eIF4E (MiRanda (http://\nwww.microrna.org) and Target Scan (http://www.targetscan.org))\nsuch as miR-150b and miR-382 did not significantly alter in\nexpression in melanoma cells compared with melanocytes\n(Supplementary Table 1). Of importance, miR-768-3p was\nexpressed at reduced levels in 48/50 of metastatic melanoma\nisolates relative to primary melanocytes (Figure 3d), suggesting\nthat inhibition of miR-768-3p expression may have functional\nsignificance in melanoma biology in vivo.\n\nFigure 1.

These results indicate that this\nRNA is indeed processed into a mature miR (miR-768-3p) in\nmelanoma cells.36\n\nTo verify that miR-768-3p targets eIF4E, we introduced\nluciferase reporter plasmids of the 30-UTR of eIF4E into Mel-RM\ncells and HEMn-MP melanocytes (Figure 4b and Supplementary\nFigure 2). The reporter activity was markedly suppressed by the\npresence of the 30-UTR of eIF4E in HEMn-MP, and to a lesser extent\nin Mel-RM cells, which was however reversed when the 30-UTR was\nmutated (Figure 4b), suggesting that the 30-UTR of eIF4E was\ninhibited by endogenous miR-768-3p. In support, cointroduction\nof anti-miR-768-3p into Mel-RM and HEMn-MP cells increased\n(Figure 4c), whereas the addition of miR-768-3p mimics further\nreduced the reporter activity (Figure 4d). Therefore, miR-768-3p\ntargets the 30-UTR of eIF4E in both melanoma cells and\nmelanocytes. The fragment of DNA cloned into luciferase reporter\nplasmids was indeed present at the endogenous 30-UTR of eIF4E in\n\nmiR-768-3p regulates eIF4E in melanoma\nCC Jiang et al\n\n2579\n\n& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene (2014) 2577 \u2013 2588\n\n\n\nMel-RM and HEMn-MP cells as verified by polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) analysis (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3).\nIntroduction of miR-768-3p mimics into Mel-RM cells down-\n\nregulated the endogenous eIF4E protein levels, whereas intro-\nduction of anti-miR-768-3p into HEMn-MP resulted in an increase\nin the eIF4E protein expression (Figure 4e). These results\nsubstantiate that eIF4E is a bona fide target of miR-768-3p that\nis downregulated in melanoma cells. The endogenous levels of\nanother two predicted miR-768-3p targets, Bcl-2 and ATF6, were\nnot affected by the introduction of miR-768-3p mimics or anti-\nmiR-768-3p (Supplementary Figure 4), suggesting that suppres-\nsion of eIF4E by miR-768-3p is highly selective in melanoma cells.\nWe also examined representative fresh melanoma isolates\n\nsampled by relatively low (n\u00bc 3), intermediate (n\u00bc 3) and high\n(n\u00bc 3) levels of miR-768-3p for the expression of eIF4E. The results\nshowed that melanomas with low miR-768-3p expression\ndisplayed relatively high levels of eIF4E, whereas intermediate\nand high miR-768-3p expression associated with progressively less\neIF4E (Figure 4f). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of miR-768-3p on\neIF4E in vivo is in accordance with the regulatory model identified\nin vitro (Figures 4c\u2013f).\n\nDownregulation of miR-768-3p contributes to increased nascent\nprotein synthesis\nHaving established the role of miR-768-3p in the suppression of\neIF4E, we examined whether it is involved in increased nascent\nprotein synthesis in melanoma cells. Introduction of miR-768-3p\ninto Mel-RM and Mel-CV cells led to decreased global protein\nproduction (Figure 5a), which recapitulated the effect of knock-\ndown of eIF4E (Figure 1g). In contrast, introduction of anti-\nmiR-768-3p into HEMn-MP melanocytes resulted in increased\nnascent protein synthesis, which could be abolished by the\n\ncointroduction of eIF4E siRNA (Figures 5b and c). These results\nindicate that downregulation of miR-768-3p has an important role\nin increased protein synthesis in melanoma cells through the\nupregulation of eIF4E.\n\nMiR-768-3p is responsive to the MEK/ERK pathway\nThe MEK/ERK pathway that has an important role in the regulation\nof mRNA translation is constitutively activated in the majority of\nmelanomas.28,29 We therefore examined whether miR-768-3p is\ninvolved in MEK/ERK-mediated regulation of protein synthesis\nin melanoma cells. Comparison of miRNA expression profiles in\nMel-CV (BRAFV600E) cells before and after treatment with the\nmutant BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 showed that an increase in\nmiR-768-3p (B8-fold) was among the most significant changes\nin miRNA expression (Figure 6a and Supplementary Table 2). This\nwas confirmed in a panel of BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines\n(Figure 6b). Similarly, treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126\ncaused increases in miR-768-3p in both BRAFV600E and wild-type\nBRAF melanoma cell lines (Figure 6c). These results suggest that\nthe MEK/ERK pathway has an important role in the suppression of\nmiR-768-3p in melanoma cells.\nPLX4720 inhibited nascent protein production in BRAFV600E\n\nmelanoma cells, whereas U0126 in both BRAFV600E and wild-type\nBRAF melanoma cells (Figure 6d). However, this inhibition was\npartially reversed in cells introduced with anti-miR-768-3p\n(Figure 6e), which in part recapitulated the inhibitory effect on\nprotein synthesis afforded by knockdown of eIF4E (Figures 1g and\n6f), indicating that suppression of miR-768-3p and subsequent\nupregulation of eIF4E is involved in enhancement of mRNA\ntranslation mediated by MEK/ERK. Taken together, results from the\nabove studies identify a novel MEK/ERK-dependent, miR-768-3p-\nmediated signalling pathway that contributes to increased\n\nFigure 2. The increase in eIF4E expression in melanoma cells may be mediated by translational upregulation.

As anticipated,\nPLX4720 downregulated the levels of phosphorylated eIF4E in\nMel-CV (BRAFV600E) cells, whereas U0126 in both Mel-CV and\nMel-RM (wild-type BRAF) cells (Figure 6g). However, the kinetics of\ninhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation by PLX4720 and U0126 was\nmore rapid than their inhibitory effects on the expression of eIF4E.\nTherefore, activation of MEK/ERK promotes mRNA translation by\nimpinging on both eIF4E expression and its phosphorylation in a\nbiphasic manner.\n\nMiR-768-3p inhibits melanoma cell proliferation and survival\nAlthough introduction of miR-768-3p mimics, alike knockdown of\neIF4E, triggered apoptosis in a proportion of Mel-RM and Mel-CV\ncells (Figures 7a\u2013c), inhibition of cell proliferation appeared to be\nthe predominant consequence as shown in 5-bromo-20-deoxy-\nuridine (BrdU) incorporation and clonogenic assays (Figure 7d). In\naddition, cointroduction of miR-768-3p mimics and eIF4E siRNA\nfurther enhanced inhibition of cell survival and proliferation\n(Figure 7e). On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of miR-768-3p\non cell proliferation was abolished in Mel-RM and Mel-CV cells\n\noverexpressing eIF4E (Figure 7f). Therefore, downregulation of\nmiR-768-3p contributes to melanoma cell survival and prolifera-\ntion by impinging on the expression of eIF4E.\nTo exclude possible off-target effects of the massive increase (a\n\nmore than 15 000-fold increase in Mel-RM cells) in miR-768-3p\nexpression, resulting from the introduction of miR-768-3p mimics,\nwe introduced an miR-768-3p precursor-expressing construct into\nMel-RM and Mel-CV cells. This led to a 24- and 34-fold increase\nin miR-768-3p in Mel-RM and Mel-CV cells, respectively\n(Supplementary Figure 5). Introduction of the construct caused\napoptosis and inhibition of proliferation to a similar extent to\nthat triggered by miR-768-3p mimics (Supplementary Figure 5),\nsuggesting that the effect of miR-768-3p on melanoma cell\nsurvival and proliferation is specific.\nTo further validate the role of miR-768-3p in melanoma cell\n\nsurvival and proliferation, we introduced miR-768-3p mimics into\ntwo fresh metastatic melanoma isolates, Mel-JR and Mel-BE.\nAs shown in Figure 7g, introduction of miR-768-3p mimics also\nresulted in reduced proliferation rates of these fresh melanoma\nisolates, which may reflect more closely melanoma cell responses\nto altered miR-768-3p expression in vivo.\n\nFigure 3.

This\nwas associated with inhibition of cell proliferation and survival.\nOur results also reveal that downregulation of miR-768-3p in\nmelanoma cells is mediated by activation of the MEK/ERK\npathway.\nCancer cells require greater protein synthesis output to sustain\n\ntheir malignancy.1\u20134 Consistent with this, we found that global\n\nmRNA translation and nascent protein production were increased\nin melanoma cells compared with melanocytes. Although we did\nnot examine the translation rate of any particular mRNA,\nit is conceivable that translation of mRNAs encoding cancer-\npromoting proteins are accelerated in melanoma cells, as the\nincrease in global protein synthesis is associated with an increase\nin the expression of eIF4E. While the latter is known to have the\npotential to mediate translation of almost every mRNA, its\noverexpression preferentially stimulates synthesis of a number of\nproteins that are associated with cancers such as c-MYC, cyclin-D1\nand VEGF.1,38\u201340 mRNAs encoding these proteins have highly\nstructured 50-UTRs, which result in their translation repression\nunder normal conditions.1,41 Nevertheless, these mRNAs respond\nmore efficiently to elevated eIF4E.1,38 Indeed, c-MYC, cyclin-D1 and\n\nmiR-768-3p regulates eIF4E in melanoma\nCC Jiang et al\n\n2582\n\nOncogene (2014) 2577 \u2013 2588 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited\n\n\n\nVEGF have all been reported to increase in expression in\nmelanoma compared with nevus tissues.38\u201340\n\nIn experimental systems, overexpression of eIF4E promotes\ncancer development and progression, whereas inhibition of\neIF4E suppresses malignancy.42,43 Consistently, the expression of\neIF4E is increased in many types of cancers including melanoma\nin vivo,13\u201315,44 which is commonly correlated with disease\nprogression and poor prognosis of patients, and is associated\nwith resistance to therapeutic agents.13\u201315,44 However, although it\nis well known that the eIF4E activity is regulated by its availability\nand phosphorylation, the mechanisms responsible for its\nupregulation remain less understood. We found in this study\nthat the eIF4E protein was increased to a noticeably greater\ndegree than its transcript in melanoma cells compared with\nmelanocytes (B6 vsB1.6 times), and that the stability of the\nprotein and transcript remained similar between the two types of\n\ncells, suggesting that the increase in eIF4E is primarily mediated\nby translational regulation. We were thus promoted to explore\nthe potential role of miRs in the regulation of eIF4E expression\nand identified downregulation of miR-768-3p as an important\nmechanism responsible for the upregulation of eIF4E in\nmelanoma cells.\nAs miR-768-3p is located within the sequence of the small\n\nnucleolar RNA HBII-239,34 its existence as an miR has been\nchallenged and its entry has been removed from miRBASE.\nHowever, we found that miR-768-3p was associated with Ago\nproteins, a core component of the RNA-induced silencing\ncomplex, to the same extent as miR-221, a well-established miR\nthat is increased in melanoma cells, indicating that miR-768-3p\npossesses the characteristics of a functional miR in melanoma\ncells.36 In support, it has been recently reported that miRs could\nbe generated by small nucleolar RNA.35 It is conceivable that\n\nFigure 4.

Targeting eIF4E by miR-768-3p appeared to be highly selective,\nin that the expression of Bcl-2 and ATF6, both of which are predicted\ntargets of miR-768-3p, did not respond to overexpression or\ninhibition of miR-768-3p. Regulation of target expression by miRs\nis known to be tissue- and cell type-specific.17\n\nThe expression of miRs can be regulated by diverse mechanisms.\nThese include genetic alterations, epigenetic changes and transcrip-\ntion factor-mediated transactivation or repression.17,20 Of interest,\nmany miRs are associated with signalling pathways important for the\npathogenesis of melanoma. For example, miR-221/222 has been\nidentified as regulators of c-KIT, whereas miR-137 and miR-148 as\nregulators of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor.21,45,46 In\nparticular, it has been recently reported that a number of miRs such\nas miR-193a, miR-338 and miR-768-3p are subjected to regulation by\noncogenic activation of MEK/ERK signalling in melanoma.30,31 Our\nfinding that suppression of miR-768-3p by MEK/ERK contributes to\nenhanced mRNA translation through the upregulation of eIF4E\nindicates that miR-768-3p is a build-in component of the MEK/ERK\npathway in melanoma cells. Therefore, activation of MEK/ERK\nsignalling enhances protein synthesis not only by phosphorylating\neIF4E vial activation of MNK1 and MNK21\u20134,7 but also through the\nupregulation of eIF4E expression.\nOf note, miR-768-3p is embedded within intron 12 of the\n\nhuman gene encoding adaptor-related protein complex 1, gamma 1\nsubunit (AP1G1),47 which was also increased by inhibition of\nMEK (Supplementary Figure 6), suggesting that miR-768-3p may\nbe regulated along with the AP1G1 gene in response to MEK/ERK\nsignalling. However, the exact mechanism involved and the\nfunctional significance of the regulation of APIG1 by MEK/ERK\nremains to be investigated. APIG1 is known to have an important\nrole in protein transportation mediated by clathrin-coated\nvesicles.48\n\nThe functional significance of miR-768-3p in melanoma was\ndemonstrated by inhibition of cell survival and proliferation with its\noverexpression, which was also echoed by its downregulation in\nfresh melanoma isolates and the negative association between its\nexpression levels and the levels of eIF4E. Multiple molecules\nconceivably contribute to the regulation of melanoma cell survival\nand proliferation by miR-768-3p, such as c-MYC and cyclin D1, which\nare sensitive to changes in the expression levels of eIF4E.33,38\u201341\n\nTargeting eIF4E is in development for clinical use in the treatment of\ncancer.3,49 Our results suggest that restoration of the expression of\nmiR-768-3p may be a useful alternative strategy for inhibition of\neIF4E in melanoma. As a precedent, replacement therapy has been\nshown to be efficacious in a mouse model of colon cancer for miR-\n145 and miR-33a.50 With continuing investigations into in vivo\ndelivery systems for miRs, this approach is likely to be achievable.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell culture and reagents\nThe human melanoma cell lines used have been described previously and are\nsummarized in Supplementary Table 3.51 They were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s\nmodified Eagle\u2019s medium containing 5% foetal calf serum (Commonwealth\nSerum Laboratories, Melbourne, VIC, Australia).

Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 6\ufffd 105 per well in a 6-\nwell plate. After 24h, cells were washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS) and incubated with methionine-free medium for 1h at 37 1C. Fifty\nmicromolar metabolic labelling reagent was then added, followed by\nincubating at 37 1C for 3h. Cells were then scraped off into fluorescence-\nactivated cell sorter tubes and washed with PBS and fixed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde, followed by permeabilization in PBS with supplemented\nwith 0.1% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin for 15min. Permeabilized\ncells were then incubated with Click-iT reaction cocktail (Life Technologies) for\n30min at room temperature in dark. Cells were finally stained with Alexa\nFluor 488 azide, followed by flow cytometry analysis. The mean fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) of each sample was corrected by extracting the background\nMFI detected in the corresponding sample without labelling with the\nmetabolic labelling reagent. The relative magnitude of nascent protein\nsynthesis in each sample represented by its MFI was then normalized against\nthe MFI of the control sample in each experiment.\n\nPolysome profiling\nPolysome profiling was performed as reported previously.53 Briefly, cells\nwere seeded at a density of 7.5\ufffd 106 cells in a T150 flask. After 24 h, cells\nwere washed with PBS and incubated in 0.1mg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma-\nAldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) in PBS for 3min at 37 1C. Cells were\nwashed two times with PBS containing CHX (0.1mg/ml) and lysed in RNA\nlysis buffer. Nuclei were subsequently removed by centrifugation, and cell\ndebris was further removed from the supernatant. The lysate was layered\nonto 10-ml continuous sucrose gradients. After 90min of centrifugation at\n39 000 r.p.m. in an SW41-Ti rotor at 4 1C, the absorbance at 254 nm was\nmeasured continuously as a function of gradient depth.\n\nBrdU incorporation\nBrdU incorporation assays were performed by using FITC BrdU Flow Kit (BD\nBiosciences, North Ryde, NSW, Australia). Briefly, 10ml BrdU solution was\nadded into the tissue culture medium followed with desired treatment.\nCells were then harvested and analysed using a flow cytometer.\n\nApoptosis\nQuantitation of apoptotic cells was carried out by measurement of sub-G1\nDNA content using propidium iodide on a flow cytometer as described\nelsewhere.51,52\n\nWestern blot analysis\nWestern blot analysis and quantitation of protein bands were carried\nout as described previously.46,48\n\nCo-immunoprecipitation of Ago and miRs\nCo-immunoprecipitation of Ago and miRs was carried out as described by\nothers.36 Briefly, 200ml of MagnaBind goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G\nMagnetic Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scoresby, VIC, Australia) was\nwashed with PBS and incubated with 10mg of a mouse anti-pan-Ago\nantibody (MABE56; Millipore, Kilsyth, VIC, Australia) or purified mouse normal\nimmunoglobulin G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 1C. The beads were\nthen added into the 400ml of whole-cell lysates and incubated overnight at\n4 1C, followed by washing three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. The\nbeads were then divided equally into two parts. Proteins from half of the\nbeads were eluted in 2\ufffd sodium dodecyl sulphate sample buffer, followed\nby sodium dodecyl sulphate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western\nblot analysis of Ago. The other half of the beads was processed for RNA\nisolation using QIAzol, followed by quantitative reverse transcription and real-\ntime PCR (qPCR) analysis of miRs.\n\nTaqMan low-density array miR array\nmiRNA array was performed using TaqMan TaqMan low-density array card\n(Applied Biosystems). Briefly, miRNA was purified by using miRNeasy Mini Kit\n(Qiagen, Chadstone Centre, VIC, Australia). Purified miRNA was reversed\ntranscribed using the Megaplex Reverse transcription primer pool (Applied\nBiosystems). Hundred nanogram cDNA was mixed with TaqMan Universal\n\nPCR Master Mix and then loaded onto the TaqMan low-density array card\nfollowed with qPCR analysis using an ABI Fast 7900HT sequence detection\nsystem (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of TaqMan low-density array data\n(Applied Biosystems) was performed using the SDS software v.2.4 (Applied\nBiosystems). Relative microRNA abundance was calculated with the RQ\nManager v.1.2.1 (Applied Biosystems), and data were analysed with DataAssist\nv.2.0 (Applied Biosystems).54 MiRs with cycle threshold (Ct) values X40 were\nexcluded from further analysis. The expression levels of remaining miRs were\ncalculated against the Ct value of RNU48 as 2(\u2013DCt)/2(\u2013DCtreference).\n\nQuantitative reverse transcription and real-time PCR\nQuantitation of miR-768-3p by qPCR was performed using TaqMan\nmicroRNA (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, target miRNA was reverse\ntranscripted from 2ng purified total miRNA by using TaqMan MicroRNA\nReverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). qPCR was performed using\nan ABI Fast 7900HT sequence detection system. Ct values for miR-768-3p\nwere normalized to the Ct value of RNU48.\nqPCR analysis of eIF4E or AP1G1 mRNA expression was also carried out as\n\ndescribed previously.27 Assay-on-demand for eIF4E (Assay ID: Hs00854166_g1)\nand for AP1G1 (Assay ID: Hs00964419_m1) were used according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol (Applied Biosystems). The relative expression level of\neIF4E mRNA in each sample was normalized against b-actin mRNA.\n\nPlasmid vectors and transfection\nThe Myc-DDK-tagged ORF clone of eIF4E was purchased from Origene\n(Australian Biosearch, Perth, WA, Australia). Cells were transfected with 2 mg\nplasmid or the empty vector in Opti-MEM medium with Lipofectamine\n2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nOverexpression of miR-768-3p\nThe bacterial stock of Human Pre-microRNA Expression Construct (pCDH-\nCMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP-miR-768) and the scramble control hairpin in pCDH-\nCMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP were purchased from System Biosciences (Mountain\nView, CA, USA). Plasmids were purified by Qiagen Endotoxin-free Plasmid Kit\n(Qiagen), and were then transfected into cells by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent\n(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nSmall RNA interference\nThe siRNA constructs for eIF4E were obtained as the siGENOME SMARTpool\nreagents from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The siGENOME\nSMARTpool eIF4E (M-003884-03-0010) and SiConTRolNontargeting SiRNA\npool (D-001206-13-20) were used (Dharmacon).\n\nLuciferase reporter assays\nLuciferase report assays to analyse eIF4E-30-UTR activity was performed as\ndescribed previously.22,27 The full-length sequence of eIF4E 30-UTR is located\nat the position between 2178 and 4749 of eIF4E mRNA (NM_001968.3). The\nfragment cloned into the luciferase report plasmid is at a region between\n2178 and 3144 of eIF4E mRNA. In brief, eIF4E-30-UTR and eIF4E-30-UTR-mut\nwere constructed into pSI-CHECK2-report plasmid (Promega, Sydney, NSW,\nAustralia). Plasmids and miR-768-3p mimics or anti-miR-768-3p were co-\ntransfected into cells (0.5\ufffd 104 cells per well in 96-well plate) by using\nLipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The luciferase activity was measured\nusing the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and detected by\nSynergy 2 multidetection microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) eIF4E\n30-UTR report RNA levels represented by Renilla luciferase activity were\nnormalized against luciferase activity of firefly that served as the intraplasmid\ntransfection normalization reporter.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported by the NSW State Cancer Council, Cancer Institute NSW, and\nNational Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Australia.
