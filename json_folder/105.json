Previous study revealed that\nD reduced A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u221235\n-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. Our study explored the underlying mechanisms by which D mediates its\n\ntherapeutic effects in vitro. Pretreatment of cells with D diminished intracellular generation of ROS in response to A\ud835\udefd\n25\u221235\n\n. Western\nblot revealed that D significantly increased the expression and activity of HO-1, which was correlated with its protection against\nA\ud835\udefd\n25\u221235\n\n-induced injury. Addition of ZnPP, an HO-1 competitive inhibitor, significantly attenuated its protective effect in A\ud835\udefd\n25\u221235\n\n-\ntreated cells, indicating the vital role of HO-1 resistance to oxidative injury. Moreover, D induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, the\nupstream of HO-1 expression. While investigating the signaling pathways responsible for HO-1 induction, D activated ERK and\ndephosphorylated p38 in PC12 cells. Addition of U0126, a selective inhibitor of ERK, blocked D-induced Nrf2 activation and HO-\n1 induction and meanwhile reversed the protection of D against A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u221235\n-induced cell death. These findings suggest D augments\n\ncellular antioxidant defense capacity through both intrinsic free radical scavenging activity and activation ofMAPK signal pathways\nthat leads to Nrf2 activation, and subsequently HO-1 induction, thereby protecting the PC12 cells from A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u221235\n-induced oxidative\n\ncytotoxicity.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of\nsenile dementia, affecting millions of people worldwide. It\nis an age-related neurodegenerative disease pathologically\ncharacterized by deposition of senile plaques, intracellular\nneurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and loss of neurons in the\nbrain. Amyloid \ud835\udefd-peptide (A\ud835\udefd), a 39- to 43-amino acid\npeptide fragment derived from an amyloid precursor protein\nvia a sequential cleavage by \ud835\udefd- and \ud835\udefe-secretases, is the\nmajor component of senile plaques and is considered to\nbe tightly related to the development and progress of AD.\nExtensive evidence indicates that the brains of individuals\nwith AD are characterized by exaggerated oxidative stress [1\u2013\n8], and the overproduction of A\ud835\udefd leads to A\ud835\udefd-associated free\n\nradical production and cell death [9\u201313]. Not only does A\ud835\udefd\nincrease oxidative stress, but its generation is also increased\nas a result of oxidative stress, which in turn causes more\noxidative damage. Given the important role of oxidative stress\nin AD, therapeutic strategies which are directed at early\ninterventions targeted at oxidative stress may be effective\nin delaying AD development and slowing its progression.\nIndeed, increased antioxidant activity confers protection and\nhas been reported to lower the risk of AD [14]. Thus, an\napproach which simultaneously enhances various intracel-\nlular oxidative defense capacities may be more effective in\ncombating neurodegeneration.\n\nAmong the various cytoprotective enzymes, heme oxyge-\nnase (HO)has received considerable attention,which consists\nof three isoforms: HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3. Although HO-2\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nand HO-3 are constitutively expressed, HO-1 is inducible in\nmany cell types, such as neuronal cells [15, 16]. HO-1 is one of\nthemajor antioxidant/cytoprotective enzymes that are readily\ninduced in response to oxidative stress. HO-1 catalyzes the\nrate-limiting step in the heme degradation process, releasing\niron, carbonmonoxide (CO), and biliverdin.The antioxidant\npotential of HO-1-generated metabolic products highlights\ntheHO-1 pathway as a therapeutic target for pharmacological\nintervention of various diseases including neurological dis-\norders [17\u201319]. The induction of HO-1 resulted in a relatively\nhigher resistance to glutamate- andH\n\n2\nO\n2\n-mediated oxidative\n\ndamage and MPTP- or A\ud835\udefd-induced neurotoxicity [20\u201323].\nTranscriptional regulation of the ho-1 gene is linked to the\ntranscription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2), which plays\na crucial role in cellular defense. Nrf2 is a basic leucine\nzipper transcription factor that resides in the cytoplasm\nbound to its inhibitor protein, Keap1, and translocated to the\nnucleus after stimulation. It then binds to the antioxidant\nresponse element (ARE) sequences in the promoter regions\nof cluster of antioxidant/detoxifying genes, such as ho-1 [24\u2013\n26]. Activation of Nrf2 pathway has been demonstrated to be\ninvolved in the protection of the nerve cells against oxidative\ndamage in vivo and in vitro [27\u201329]. Neurons lacking Nrf2\nare highly sensitive to oxidative stress but can be rescued\nby transfection with a functional Nrf2 construct [30]. In\naddition, activation of theNrf2/ARE pathway in astrocytes by\ntert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an Nrf2 activity inducer, is\nable to protect neurons from subsequent oxidative stress [31].\n\nTo date, multiple signaling kinases related to cell sur-\nvival/proliferation have been reported to regulate the nuclear\ntranslocation of Nrf2, including mitogen-activated protein\nkinases (MAPKs), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and\nprotein kinase C (PKC) [32\u201334]. MAPK is one of the most\ncommon signaling pathways that serve to coordinate the\ncellular response to a variety of extracellular stimuli.These are\nwell characterized inmammals and include c-JunN-terminal\nkinase (JNK), p38 MAP kinase (p38), and mitogenic signal-\ning, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK). Several\nmembers of MAPK family are implicated in neurodegenera-\ntive processes [35] and its activation also modulates several\ngene and protein expressions, such as that of HO-1 [36, 37].\n\nThus, in light of the cytoprotective role of HO-1, the\nspecific activation of Nrf2 and upregulation of HO-1 gene\nexpression by pharmacological modulation may represent a\nnovel target form therapeutic intervention of AD. Angelica\ngigasNakai (Umbelliferae) root is used in traditional oriental\nherbal medicine to treat female afflictions and is regarded by\nherbalists as female ginseng for its hemopoietic and health-\npromoting activities [38]. Decursin (D) is a pyranocoumarin\nwhich is the major active ingredient present in Angelica gigas\nNakai. Reported in vivo and in vitro studies indicated that D\npossesses anticancer [39\u201343], antibacterial [44], antiplatelet\naggregation [45], antinematodal activities [46], and antiox-\nidant activities [47] properties. Growing bodies of evidence\nhave supported the fact that D exhibits potent neuropro-\ntective activity against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in\nprimary cultures of rat cortical cells [48] and greatly improves\nscopolamine-induced amnesia in mice [49, 50]. Our previ-\nously study indicated that D increases cellular resistance to\n\nA\ud835\udefd-induced oxidative injury in the rat pheochromocytoma\n(PC12) cells, presumably through not only the induction of\nNrf2 and related antioxidant enzymes, but also the antiag-\ngregation of A\ud835\udefd [51]. However, the upstream signaling and\nthe detailed molecular mechanisms by which D exerts its\nneuroprotective effects in vivo remain largely unresolved.\nTo gain a further insight into the biological roles of D, we\nattempt, in this study, to elucidate the correlation between\nits neuroprotection effect andHO-1 production.We designed\nan experiment to investigate whether the D-induced HO-1\nexpression is associated with the activation of MAPKs/Nrf2\nin PC12 cells following treatment with A\ud835\udefd as an in vitro\nmodel.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Materials. Amyloid beta-protein (25\u201335) trifluoroacetate\nsalt (A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335) was provided by Bachem California (Tor-\nrance, CA). RPMI+GlutaMAX-l, penicillin-streptomycin,\nfetal bovine serum (FBS), and horse serum (HS) were\npurchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). BCA protein\nassay kit was purchased fromThermo Fisher Scientific (Bar-\nrington, IL). The assay kit for cytotoxicity (WST-8) was sup-\nplied by CaymanChemical Company (AnnArbor,MI). Lipid\nperoxidation colorimetric assay kitwas obtained fromOxford\nBiochemical Research (Rochester Hills, MI). SB203580 (p38\ninhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and Protoporphyrin IX\nzinc (II) (Znpp, HO-1 Inhibitor) were obtained from Sigma-\nAldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies to Nrf2 (C-20) were\nfrom Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); phosphor-\nSAPK/JNK rabbit mAb, phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2)\nrabbit mAb, phosphor-p38 MAP kinase rabbit mAb, HO-\n1 (P249) rabbit mAb, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehy-\ndrogenase (GAPDH) rabbit mAb, anti-rabbit IgG alkaline-\nphosphatase- (AP-) linked antibodies, and U0126 (ERK\ninhibitor) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology\n(Danvers, MA). All the other reagents were of the highest\ngrade and were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,\nMO), unless otherwise indicated.\n\n2.2. Preparation of Decursin. Dwas prepared by Dr. Kim\u2019s lab\nin theDepartment of Smart Foods andDrugs, InjeUniversity,\nas described previously [52]. Briefly, dried and powdered root\nof A. gigasNakai (1 kg) was extracted with 5 L of 95% ethanol\nfor 24 h at room temperature. Extracts were filtered through\nWhatman No. 1 filter paper and were concentrated using a\nrotary evaporator (R-200, Bu\u0308chi Labortechnik AG, Flawil,\nSwitzerland) under reduced pressure, and 50 g A. gigasNakai\nethanol extract (AGNEX) was obtained. D was purified from\nAGNEX using recycling preparative HPLC (LC-9104, JAI,\nTokyo, Japan). The AGNEX (20 g) was dissolved in 30mL of\n70% acetonitrile/water and filtered with a 0.45\ud835\udf07mmembrane\nfilter. 3mL of sample was injected to the JAIGEL ODS-AP\ncolumn (20 \u00d7 500mm, JAI) at a flow rate of 4mL/min.\nIsocratic elution was applied using 70% acetonitrile/water\nas the mobile phase, and the peaks were detected using an\nRI and UV/Vis detector at 328 nm. Finally, 5.3 g of D was\nobtained.\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\n2.3. Preparation of A\ud835\udefd\n25\u201335 Stock Solution. A\ud835\udefd25\u201335, the most\n\ntoxic peptide fragment derived from the amyloid precursor\nprotein (APP), was dissolved in deionized distilled water at\na concentration of 1mM and was incubated in 37\u2218C for 3\nd to induce maximal aggregation according to the previous\nreport [53]. In order to create stable conditions for the aged\nstock solution, the solutionwas stored at\u221280\u2218Cand diluted in\nserum-free medium to desired concentrations immediately\nbefore use.\n\n2.4. Cell Culture. The rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line\nkindly provided byDr. Kam (Inje University) wasmaintained\nin RPMI+GlutaMAX-l supplemented with 5% FBS, 10% HS,\nand 1% penicillin-streptomycin and cultured at 37\u2218C in a\nhumidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n\n2\n. All cells were plated\n\nin poly-L-lysine coated culture dishes. The medium was\nchanged every other day, and the cells were plated at an\nappropriate density according to the scale of each experiment.\nAfter the 24 h subculture, cells were switched to serum-free\nmedium for treatment.\n\n2.5. Assay for Cell Viability. The cell viability was assessed by\nthe WST-8 cell proliferation assay kit according to the man-\nufacturer\u2019s instructions (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann\nArbor, MI). Briefly, PC12 cells were seeded in 96-well cul-\nture plates. After incubation, the media were supplemented\nwith 10 \ud835\udf07L/well WST for 2 h prior to spectrophotometric\nevaluation. Conversion of WST to formazan was measured\nat 450 nm by fluorescence multidetection reader (Synergy\nHT, Biotek, Highland Park, IL). This reaction reflects the\nreductive capacity of the cells, representing the viability of\nthe cells, and the results were expressed as the percentage\nof control (untreated) cells. Decreased WST reduction was\ntaken as an indication of neuronal cell injury.\n\n2.6. Assay of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species. ROS pro-\nduction in PC12 cells was measured using the redox-sensitive\nfluorescent dyeH\n\n2\nDCF-DA. Briefly, PC12 cells were seeded in\n\n96-well plates, following treatment, the cells were loadedwith\n10 \ud835\udf07MH\n\n2\nDCF-DA at 37\u2218C for 30min in the dark and then\n\nwashed twice with PBS, and finally, the fluorescence intensity\nwas measured at the excitation wavelength of 485 nm and\nthe emission wavelength of 530 nm using a fluorescence\nmicroplate reader (Synergy HT, Biotek, Highland Park, IL).\nData were analyzed and expressed as a percentage of the\ncontrol.\n\n2.7. Assay of HO Activity. The HO activity was measured\nby spectrophotometric determination of bilirubin formation\naccording to the previously described procedures. Briefly,\nmicrosomes obtained from harvested cells were added to\na reaction mixture (1mL final volume, pH 7.4) contain-\ning NADPH, bilirubin reductase from rat liver cytosol,\nand the substrate hemin. The reaction was conducted at\n37\u2218C in the dark for 1 h, terminated by the addition of\n1mL of chloroform, and the extracted bilirubin was mea-\nsured by the difference in absorbance between 464 and\n530 nm.\n\n2.8. Nuclear and Cytosolic Lysate Preparation. Cells were\ntreated with various chemicals, as detailed in the figure\nlegends. Nuclear extracts were prepared with a commercial\nkit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Active\nMotif, Carlsbad, CA). All steps were carried out on ice or\nat 4\u2218C unless stated otherwise. Protease inhibitors (10 \ud835\udf07g/mL\naprotinin, 10 \ud835\udf07g/mL leupeptin) and a reducing agent (1mM\ndithiothreitol, 1mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride) were\nadded to each buffer just prior to use. Briefly, cells were\nincubated in 5 vol of hypotonic buffer A (20mM HEPES\n(pH 7.9), 1.5mM MgCl\n\n2\n, and 10mMKCl) on ice for 15min\n\nand homogenized. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation\nat 3000 \u00d7g for 15min, and the supernatant was kept as\nthe cytoplasmic extract. The nuclei were washed once using\nnuclei wash buffer (10mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2mM MgCl\n\n2\n,\n\nand 10mM KCl) and extracted for 30min on ice in buffer\nC (20mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420mM NaCl,\n0.2mM EDTA, and 1.5mM MgCl\n\n2\n). Insoluble material was\n\nremoved by centrifugation at 21,000\u00d7g for 10min. The\nsupernatant was used as the nuclear extract. All the protein\nfractions were stored at \u221270\u2218C until use, and the protein\nconcentrations were measured with a BCA protein assay kit\n(ThermoFisher Scientific, Barrington, IL).\n\n2.9. Western Blot Analysis. Western blot was performed\nby the standard method. Equal amounts of proteins were\nfractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\nand electrotransferred to an Immun-Blot PVDF membrane\n(0.2 \ud835\udf07M pore size, Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked\novernight at 4\u2218C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.05% (v/v)\nTween-20, 150mM NaCl, and 5% (w/v) bovine serum\nAlbumin (BSA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA),\nfollowed by 2 h incubation with primary antibody diluted in\nthe same buffer (Nrf2 1 : 250, HO-1 1 : 1000, phosphor-p42/44\nMAPK (ERK1/2) 1 : 1000, phosphor-SAPK/JNK 1 : 1000,\nphosphor-p38 MAPK 1 : 1000, and GAPDH 1 : 1000). After\nwashing with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in TBS, the membrane\nwas incubated with anti-rabbit IgG AP-linked secondary\nantibody for 1 h at room temperature and then washed\nwith the same buffer. The immunoblotted membrane was\ndeveloped with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate\n(BCIP)/nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) color-developing\nsolution. The blots in the samples were quantified by\ndensitometry analysis using PDQuest software (version 7.0,\nBio-Rad, Hercules, CA). All data from three independent\nexperiments were expressed as the relative intensity\ncompared to the control group for the statistical analyses.\n\n2.10. DPPH-Scavenging Capacities. D and \ud835\udefc-tocopherol were\nevaluated for their activities to scavenge the stable DPPH\nradical according to a previously described method.

Results\n\n3.1. Effect of D on Cell Viability of PC12 Cells. Initially, the\ncytotoxic potential of D on PC12 cells was measured. No\ncytotoxic effects of D were reported up to a concentration\nof 10 \ud835\udf07M, using the WST assay. However, higher amount D\nreduced the viability of the PC12 cells (Figure 1(a)). Thus,\nfor further experiments, the cells were treated with D in the\nconcentration range of 0.01\u201310\ud835\udf07M. Furthermore, 10\ud835\udf07M D\ntreatment for 24, 48, and 72 h did not show any toxic effect\non cultured PC12 cells (Figure 1(b)).\n\n3.2. Effect of D on HO-1 Expression and HO Activity of\nPC12 Cells. As HO-1 is an important component of the\ncellular defense against oxidative stress, we assessed whether\nnoncytotoxic concentrations (0.01\u201310 \ud835\udf07M) of D affected HO-\n1 protein expression and HO activity. PC12 cells exposed\nto D for 24 h caused a dose-dependent increase in HO-1\nexpression (Figure 2(a)) and HO activity (Figure 2(c)). At a\nconcentration of 10\ud835\udf07MD,HO-1 induction was evident at 3 h,\npeaked at around 6 h, and decreased after 12 h in PC12 cells\n(Figure 2(b)). Consistently, D-induced HO activity directly\ncorrelated with enhanced HO-1 protein level (Figure 2(d)).\n\n3.3. Effect of D on A\ud835\udefd\n25\u201335-Induced Cytotoxicity and Intra-\n\ncellular ROS Generation in PC12 Cells. To evaluate the in\nvitro neuroprotective effect of D, we tested its protective\neffect on A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. PC12\ncells were treated with various sub-lethal concentrations of\nD for 3 h, followed by further incubation for 24 h in the\npresence or the absence of A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335. Treatment with A\ud835\udefd25\u201335\n(25 \ud835\udf07M) for 24 h induced approximately 40% cell death,\nwhereas D, at non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.01\u201310\ud835\udf07M),\nresulted in marked enhancement of survival of the PC12\ncells as compared to the A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335-treated group (Figure 3(a)).\nMaximal rescue occurred at a concentration of 10 \ud835\udf07M of\nD. These results showed that A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335 treatment significantly\nreduced the viability of PC12 cells and that D blocked the\ninjury caused by A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335.\nIt has been reported that A\ud835\udefd impairs mitochondrial\n\nredox activity and increases the generation of ROS [54\u2013\n56]. The degree of intracellular ROS generation in cells was\nmeasured using fluorescence assay with H\n\n2\nDCF-DA probe.\n\nH\n2\nDCF-DA can be deacetylated in cells, where it can react\n\nquantitatively with intracellular radicals, mainly H\n2\nO\n2\n, and\n\nconvert into its fluorescent products DCF, which are retained\nwithin the cell. Therefore, this assay provides an index of cell\ncytosolic oxidation. As shown in Figure 3(b), treatment with\nD significantly reduced the A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335-induced ROS generation,\nindicating that D attenuates ROS production. Moreover, as\nshown in Figure 3(c), this effect was dependent on the dura-\ntion of D pretreatment. Thus, attenuation of ROS released by\nD required the presence of D at least 3 h prior to the addition\nof D.These results suggest that D induced the expression of a\ngene(s) essential to ROS antagonism.\n\n3.4. Effect of HO-1 Expression on A\ud835\udefd\n25\u201335-Induced Oxidative\n\nNeurotoxicity Mediated by D in PC12 Cells. Recent reports\nhave described the expression ofHO-1 as an adaptive andpro-\ntective response against oxidative insult in a wide variety of\ncells, such as PC12 cells. To test whether the protective effect\nof D is related to its inductive effect on HO-1 expression, we\ntried to block the activity of HO-1 using Znpp, the inhibitor\nof HO activity.

The HO-1 inducer CoPP showed\ncomparable protection to D. ZnPP, abrogated the protective\neffect of D on A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335-induced cytotoxicity, and partially\nreversed the inhibitory effects of D onROS production.These\nresults suggest that the cytoprotective effect of D is mediated\nthrough HO-1 induction.\n\n3.5. Effects of D on Nrf2 Nuclear Translocation in PC12 Cells.\nSeveral studies have reported that nuclear translocation of\nactivated Nrf2 is an important upstream contributor to the\nmechanism of HO-1 expression. Therefore, we examined\nwhether D could induce the translocation of Nrf2 to the\nnucleus in PC12 cells. Using Western blot analysis, we tested\n\nthe presence of Nrf2 proteins in nuclear compartments of\nPC12 cells. The cells were incubated with 10\ud835\udf07M D for 0, 1,\n3, and 6 h. As shown in Figure 5(a), the nuclear fractions\nof D-treated PC12 cells showed a gradual increase in Nrf2\nlevels which was strongly correlated with the increase in\nHO-1 expression and HO-1 activity (Figure 2), whereas they\nwere decreased concomitantly in the cytoplasmic fractions\n(Figure 5(b)).\n\n3.6.

To further elucidate the\nupstream signaling pathway involved in D-mediated Nrf2\nactivation and HO-1 induction, we examined the effect\nof D on activation of MAPKs in PC12 cells. Cells were\nexposed to D, total protein was harvested, and then West-\nern blots were performed using anti-phospho-JNK, ERK,\nand p38 antibodies. At a concentration of 10 \ud835\udf07M, which\nstrongly induced the levels of HO-1, D caused prolonged\nERK activation. As illustrated in Figure 6, phosphorylation\nof ERK was observed 0.5 h after D treatment and was\nsustained for up to 1 h after D treatment. In contrast,\nphosphorylation of p38 kinases was decreased. No changes\nin the expression of phospho-JNK protein were detected,\nverifying that similar amounts of proteinswere loaded in each\nlane.\n\nNext, to address the role of MAPK in D-induced HO-\n1 expression against A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335, we examined the effects of\nspecific inhibitors of ERK (U0126), JNK (SP600125), and p38\n\n(SB203580) on the levels ofHO-1 and cell viability, byWestern\nblot and WST assay. As shown in Figures 7(a) and 7(b),\nThe U0126 significantly reduced D-induced HO-1 expression\nand activity. Likewise, D against A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335-induced cell death\nwas effectively abolished by U0126 (Figure 7(c)), whereas p38\ninhibitor increased these items. The inhibitor of JNK did\nnot show any changes at any of the tested time periods.\nTherefore, we suggested that D-induced expression of HO-\n1 was mediated through ERK pathway phosphorylation and\ndecreased p38 activation in the PC12 cells. U0126, SP600125,\nand SB203580 alone did not alter cell viability in control or\nA\ud835\udefd\n25\u201335-treated cells (data not shown).\nFurthermore, we examined whether the MAPK pathway\n\nwas involved in D-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation. As\nshown in Figure 7(d), inhibitor of the ERK MAPK pathway\nblocked D-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation; on the con-\ntrary, p38 inhibitor facilitated the translocation ofNrf2.These\nresults indicate a role for MAPK signaling in D-mediated\nHO-1 induction through nuclear translocation of Nrf2.\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\nC\n\nel\nl v\n\nia\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\n(%\n)\n\n##\n##\n\n####\n\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+ \u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n+\n\nA\ud835\udefd25\u201335 (25\ud835\udf07M)\nD (10\ud835\udf07M)\n\nCoPP (20\ud835\udf07M)\nZnPP (50\ud835\udf07M)\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nD\nC\n\nF \nflu\n\nor\nes\n\nce\nnc\n\ne \n(f\n\nol\nd \n\nof\n c\n\non\ntr\n\nol\n)\n\n## ##\n\u2217 \u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\n\n###\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n+\n\nA\ud835\udefd25\u201335 (25\ud835\udf07M)\nD (10\ud835\udf07M)\n\nCoPP (20\ud835\udf07M)\nZnPP (50\ud835\udf07M)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: Effect of HO-1 expression on A\ud835\udefd\n25\u201335-induced oxidative neurotoxicity mediated by D in PC12 cells.

The DPPH stable free radical\nmethod is an easy, rapid, and sensitive way to survey the\nantioxidant activity of compounds or extracts. Figure 8(a)\ndemonstrates that DPPH-scavenging potentials increased as\nthe concentrations of D and \ud835\udefc-tocopherol increased. This\nresult indicates that the antioxidant effect of D is similar\nto \ud835\udefc-tocopherol for trapping DPPH. The TEAC of D was\nfurther measured from the decolorization of ABTS\u2219+, which\n\nwas measured spectrophotometrically at 734 nm.

In AD,\noxidative stress is suspected to be generated by A\ud835\udefd [56].\nRecent studies showed that there is a vicious circle among\nA\ud835\udefd production/accumulation and oxidative stress [61, 62].\nGiven the important role of oxidative stress in AD, ther-\napeutic strategies which are directed at early interventions\ntargeted at oxidative stress may be effective in delaying A\ud835\udefd\ndevelopment and slowing its progression. A feasible ways\nto prevent ROS-mediated cellular damage is to augment\nthe intracellular oxidative defense capacity through dietary\nor pharmacological intake of antioxidants. Moreover, the\n\ninduction of endogenous phase II detoxifying enzymes or\nantioxidative proteins seems to be a reasonable strategy for\ndelaying disease progression and the toxic effects associated\nwith A\ud835\udefd-mediated cytotoxicity [63\u201366].

This was also confirmed with our cell-\nbased antioxidant assay in which D significantly reduced the\nbasal intracellular level of ROS (Figure 3). A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335 caused a\nsignificant decrease in PC12 cell viability, and pretreatment\ncells with D concentration-dependently increased cell via-\nbility (Figure 4(a)). These results showed a clear and strong\ncorrelation among free radical-quenching activities, ROS\nscavenging activity, and the enhanced resistance to A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335-\ninduced oxidative damage. As a consequence, the intrinsic\nantioxidant capacity may play a role for D, in contributing\ntowards the partial or total alleviation of cellular oxidative\nstress.\n\nHO-1, also known as heat-shock protein 32 (HSP 32)\nor inducible HO, is a 32-kDa protein transiently activated\nby a wide variety of noxious stimuli including oxidative\nstress. Upregulation of HO-1 leading to elevation of HO\nactivity has been shown to provide neuroprotective effects\nby converting the prooxidant heme to biologically active\nantioxidant by-products such as biliverdin/bilirubin and also\nto heme inactivating carbon monoxide. The transgenic mice\noverexpression HO-1 in the brain attenuated neuronal cell\ninjury caused by ischemic stroke [70]. HO-1 overexpressing\ncells derived from transgenic mice or the cells treated with a\nHO-1 inducer are relatively resistant to oxidative stress [20,\n22]. Induction of HO-1 is highly recognized as an important\ntherapeutic target for pharmacological intervention of oxida-\ntive disorders. It has been suggested that an elevation of HO-1\nby various stimulimay be protective cellular response to delay\nthe cell death. Therefore, we are interested in determining\nthe potential role of HO-1 in the A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335-induced PC12\ncells damage and the D-mediated neuroprotection. We have\nprovided evidence for the induction of HO-1 by D in PC12\ncells and showed that D-induced HO-1 protein expression\nand HO activity occurred in a concentration- and time-\ndependent manner (Figure 2). Furthermore, the increase\nof HO-1 expression by D conferred cytoprotection against\n\nA\ud835\udefd\n25\u201335-induced oxidative stress (Figure 3). In addition, we\n\nshowed that ZnPP, a potent inhibitor of HO activity, can\npartially reverse the protective effects of D, thus providing\nfurther evidence for HO-1 as a possible cytoprotective path-\nway for D (Figure 4(a)). The induction of HO-1 expression\nwas also required to suppress A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335-induced ROS gener-\nation (Figure 4(b)). These results strongly indicate that in\nour experimental setting, D may have multiple mechanisms\nof action that affect cytoprotection both by reducing ROS\ngeneration and boosting HO-1 induction for ROS detoxifica-\ntion.\n\nThe central sensor of intracellular oxidative stress is the\ncytosolic Keap1-Nrf2 complex. In response to oxidative stress,\nNrf2 is released from Keap1 and transmits the stress signal\nto the nucleus for activation of distinct set of genes encod-\ning phase II detoxifying enzymes as well as several stress\nresponsive proteins including HO-1 [71, 72]. Recently, Nrf2-\nARE signaling pathways have emerged as key therapeutic\ntargets for treatment of a variety of oxidative stress-related\nneurodegenerative insults [73]. Nrf2-null mice resulted in\na decrease in the basal expression level of detoxifying or\nantioxidant genes including HO-1 [74]. In contrast, Nrf2+/+\nmice protect the brain from cerebral ischemia in vivo [75],\nwhereas primary neuronal cultures treated with chemical\nactivators of the Nrf2-ARE pathway displayed significantly\ngreater resistance to oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity\n[73]. Phytochemicals including sulforaphane, caffeic acid\nphenethyl ester (CAPE), and curcumin activate the Nrf2-\nARE system [76, 77]. Using Western blot, we examined\nwhether D activated Nrf2 in PC12 cells and found that\nNrf2 was promoted translocation into the nucleus in PC12\ncells exposed to a nontoxic concentration of D (Figure 5).\nThe translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus following D\ntreatment was associated with a marked increase in HO-1\ninduction (Figure 2). Therefore, our results suggest that the\ntranscriptional activation of Nrf2 is involved in the increased\nexpression of HO-1 and the cytoprotection against A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335\ninduced in PC12 cells (Figure 7(c)).\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11\n\nThe upstream signaling pathways regulating Nrf2 trans-\nactivation remain poorly defined. Recent studies have impli-\ncated a major role for the MAPK in Nrf2-dependent translo-\ncation andHO-1 activation, although other kinases including\ntyrosine kinases, PI3K, and PKC have also emerged as\npotential contributing mechanisms coordinately or sepa-\nrately [78, 79]. In vertebrates, the three major kinase cascades\nare represented by ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK [80]. The\ncurrent experiments were designed to verify a possible role\nof MAPK pathway in D-induced Nrf2 activation and HO-1\nexpression, andDwas found to facilitate the phosphorylation\nof ERK and dephosphorylation of p38 (Figure 6). In addition,\nupregulation of HO-1 as well as Nrf2 nuclear translocation\nby D was remarkably inhibited by U0126, a highly selective\ninhibitor of ERK pathway.These investigations suggested that\nthe activation of ERK pathway by D contributed to HO-1\nexpression (Figures 7(a) and 7(b)), Nrf2 nuclear translocation\n(Figure 7(d)), and cytoprotection (Figure 7(c)) in PC12 cells.\nIt is generally acknowledged that MAPK can be differentially\nregulated by the same stimuli in diverse cell types. ERK\npathway is thought to mediate cellular responses to growth\nand differentiation factors, whereas JNK and p38 pathway\nis activated by distinct and overlapping sets of stress-related\nstimuli [81]. For instance, quercetin induces Nrf2 nuclear\ntranslocation and HO-1 upregulation via the ERK and p38\npathway but not the JNKpathway in human hepatocytes [82].\n3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione increases nuclear Nrf2 accumula-\ntion via the ERK pathway but not the p38 and JNK pathway\ninmurine keratinocytes [83]. In PC12 cells, 15-Deoxy-D12, 14-\nprostaglandin J2 induces HO-1expression via the ERK and\nAkt/PI3K pathway but not the p38 and JNK pathway [84].\nShen et al. [79] have shown that the transcriptional activity\nof Nrf2 transactivation domain was stimulated by ERK and\nJNK signaling pathways while the p38MAPKplays a negative\nrole. This may be due to the diverse assortment and intensity\nof the signaling pathways activated by different inducers in\ndifferent cell types. However, further studies are extensively\nongoing to define the exact role of the MAPK pathways in\nHO-1 expression.\n\nIn summary, the intrinsic free radical scavenging activity\nand inducing the upregulation of HO-1 expression through\nactivation of Nrf2 exposed to D confer protection against\nthe A\ud835\udefd\n\n25\u201335-induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells. One of\nthe most salient features of our present study is that ERK\nis involved in HO-1 induction via Nrf2 activation in the D-\nstimulated cells. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of ERK\nsuppressed Nrf2 activation and subsequent HO-1 expression.\nResults of our study imply the potential involvement of these\nupstream kinases in Nrf2 activation and HO-1 upregulation\nby D. However, the complete molecular milieu that links\nall these events needs to be elucidated. Continued attempts\nto identify novel target molecules responsible for the HO-\n1 regulation and to clarify their cross-talk with upstream\nand downstream signaling molecules will pave the way to\nexploiting preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for the\nmanagement of oxidative stress-mediated disorders. More-\nover, considering that the D has a property that can cross\nthe blood-brain barrier, further in vivo study with D should\nsubstantiate this therapeutic potential of this compound.\n\nThese findings indicate that D might prove to be a promising\ntherapeutic approach to combat neural demise in AD and\nother oxidative stress-related diseases.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of\nthis work by Guangdong Medical College (B2011011).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] D.
