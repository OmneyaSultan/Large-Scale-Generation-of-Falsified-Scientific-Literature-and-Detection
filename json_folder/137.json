Using immuno-\nblotting with recombinant recoverin as an antigen, we have detected anti-Rc in serum\nof the patient. At the same time, the patient did not manifest any signs of cancer-\nassociated retinopathy (CAR). Polyclonal (monospecific) antibodies against recoverin\nused for immunohistochemical analysis of the patient\u2019s tumor revealed recoverin\nexpression in the tumor sections.

The aberrant expres-\nsion of these antigens is believed to be the cause of\na number of paraneoplastic neurological syndromes\n\n(for a review, see refs. [1\ufffd/3]). One of paraneo-\nplastic antigens, Ca2\ufffd-binding protein recoverin, is\nnormally specific for retina [4,5], but it can also be\ndetected in tissues different from retina providing\ntheir malignant transformation [6\ufffd/11]. A number\nof patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC)\nwere found to have serum autoantibodies against\nrecoverin (anti-Rc) [6,7,12\ufffd/16]. In contrast to\nSCLC, only one anti-Rc-positive patient with an-\nother kind of lung cancer, non-small cell lung\ncarcinoma (NSCLC), was known so far [11]. For a\ntime, serum anti-Rc were only detected in patients\nwhen they had both lung cancers and cancer-\nassociated retinopathy (CAR) [6\ufffd/15].

In this work, we\nused recombinant recoverin to reveal anti-Rc in\nserum of a patient with NSCLC. In addition, we\nanalyzed paraffin tumor sections of the patient for\nrecoverin expression using antibodies against re-\ncoverin.\n\n2. The patient and methods\n\nA 69-year-old male with a history of chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease had been smoking\n20 cigarettes per day for 59 years. He gave up\nsmoking in 1997 when he underwent lobectomy of\nthe right lower lobe of the lung due to squamous\ncell carcinoma (pT1N0M0). During the next 2 years,\nthe patient felt satisfactorily and continued to\nwork. In June 1999, fibreoptic bronchoscopy de-\ntected a tumor at the right lower lobe stump of 2\ncm in diameter. Histological analysis of the tumor\nconfirmed the relapse of a poor differentiated\nsquamous cell carcinoma. Chest computer tomo-\ngraphy revealed metastases in the right ipsilateral\nmediastinal lymph nodes. As the patient refused to\nundergo any anti-cancer treatment, he got only a\nsupportive care before the next hospitalization in\nSeptember 2000. Between hospitalizations in 1999\nand 2000, the state of the patient\u2019s health was\ngradually deteriorating: he lost 7 kg (from 67 to 60\nkg), there appeared a pain in the back. Computer\ntomography and fibreoptic bronchoscopy detected\nthe development of the middle lobe atelectasis and\nmetastases in the ipsilateral mediastinal lymph\nnodes, spine radiography and bone scintigraphy\nrevealed vertebral body metastases (Th6-Th8), i.e.\nthe objective examination confirmed the progres-\nsive disease (cT2N2M1). In addition to supportive\ncare, the patient received prednisolone (25 mg per\nos one time a day for 10 days) for treatment of\nCOPD exacerbation. He died of progressive lung\ncancer in January 2001.\n\n2.1. Immunoblotting of serum samples\n\nSerum samples were prepared from whole blood\nof the NSCLC patient and stored at \ufffd/70 8C.\nWestern blot analysis of the samples was per-\nformed as described in [16] with homogeneous\nrecombinant myristoylated recoverin as an antigen\n[17]. Rabbit polyclonal (monospecific) anti-reco-\nverin antibodies were prepared as described in\n[4,5] and used as a positive control; normal human\nsera served as a negative control.\n\n2.2. Immunohistochemical staining\n\nTissue samples were fixed in 4% formaldegyde\nand embedded in paraffin. For an immunohisto-\nchemical study, the deparaffinized tissue sections\nwere incubated with polyclonal (monospecific)\nantibodies against recombinant recoverin [4,5] (in\na dilution of 1:100) as the first antibody. Immuno-\nperoxidase staining was applied to the specimens\nby the streptavidin\ufffd/biotin\ufffd/peroxidase-complex.\nBovine retina sections were used as a positive\ncontrol of the reaction. The tumor cells were\npositively stained with monoclonal antibodies to\nchromogranin (Dako) in a dilution of 1:200 and to\npancytokeratin (Immunotech) in a dilution of\n1:100, suggesting neuroendocrine characteristics\n(data not shown).\n\n3. Results\n\nThe first analysis of serum of the patient made in\nJune 1999 detected anti-Rc with a titre of 1:10\n(Fig. 1A). The second measurement in September\n2000 showed an increase of the titre up to 1:20\n(Fig. 1B). Thus, an amount of anti-Rc in the\npatient\u2019s serum tends to increase with the tumor\nprogression. Normal human sera used as a negative\ncontrol contain anti-Rc (see Fig. 1). Exogeneous\nrecoverin as a competitor for anti-Rc binding to\nrecoverin on the blot decreased the intensity of the\nreaction in an exogeneous recoverin-dependent\nmanner (not shown) what proves the specificity\nof the reaction.\n\nIt is of interest to note that prednisolone\nadministrated for the treatment of COPD exacer-\nbation in the patient caused a disappearance of\nanti-Rc from the patient\u2019s blood stream 10 days\nafter the treatment (see Fig. 1B), what was rather\ndue to immunosupression by steroid therapy.\n\nIt should be stressed that the patient had no loss\nof vision before the disease and during the whole\nperiod of the observation. Detailed ophtalmologi-\ncal investigation of him performed in September\n2000 showed that the patient possessed normal\nvisual acuity, his retina and optic nerve were\nwithout any changes, the fundus picture remained\nintact and the visual field was unchanged (Fig. 2).\nHence, one may conclude that the patient had no\nmanifestation of the CAR-syndrome despite the\npresence of anti-Rc in his serum. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first report on the anti-Rc-positive case\nin a NSCLC patient in the absence of the CAR-\nsyndrome.\n\nTo present day expression of recoverin has been\ndemonstrated immunohistohemically for one case\n\n364 M.S. Savchenko et al.\n\n\n\nof SCLC only [18]. Whereas no immunohistochem-\nical data have been obtained on expression of the\nprotein in NSCLC tumors. In the present study, we\nused polyclonal (monospecific) antibodies against\nrecoverin for immunohistochemical detection of\nrecoverin in the primary tumor of the NSCLC\npatient. Fig. 3 shows the sections of the tumor\nstained with the antibodies. One can see in Fig. 3A\nthat some tumor cells give recoverin-positive\nreaction (brown color). At the same time the\nstaining is absent when the antibodies are omitted\n(Fig. 3B) or preadsorbed with recoverin (Fig. 3C).\nThus, we can make a conclusion on specificity of\nthe recoverin-positive reaction revealed.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nParaneoplastic neurological syndromes asso-\nciated with malignant tumors usually occur months\n\nor even years before the cancer has been detected\nusing traditional diagnostic techniques [1] what\nallows to consider the underlying autoantibodies as\na promising tool for an early diagnostics of cancer.\nOur present study demonstrates that anti-Rc can be\ndetected in a NSCLC patient who has no CAR-\nsyndrome. While paraneoplastic neurological syn-\ndromes are very rare [1], frequencies of the\nautoantibodies vary over a wide range: from 2 to\n4% for anti-Yo and anti-Ri [19] to about 20% for anti-\nHu [20]. A frequency of anti-Rc in sera of patients\nwith SCLC was preliminary estimated as 10% [16],\nbut no statistical data have yet been obtained on\nthe serum anti-Rc frequency in patients with\nNSCLC. That is why consequent steps of our\nresearch are aimed at accumulation of statistical\ndata to estimate the anti-Rc frequencies in sera of\npatients with NSCLC irrespective of the presence of\nften recoverin is expressed in tumors of patients\nwith lung cancers.\n\nFig. 1 Immunoblotting of serum of the NSCLC patient.
