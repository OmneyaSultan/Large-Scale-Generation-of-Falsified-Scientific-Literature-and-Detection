However, it is largely unknown whether Pseudomonas aeruginosa OMVs can\nactivate inflammatory responses and whether immunization with OMVs can provide immune protection against subsequent\ninfection. We purified and identified OMVs, which were then used to infect lung epithelial cells in vitro as well as C57BL/6J mice\nto investigate the immune response and the underlying signaling pathway. The results showed that OMVs generated from P.\naeruginosa wild-type strain PAO1 were more cytotoxic to alveolar epithelial cells than those from quorum-sensing (QS)-defi-\ncient strain PAO1-\ufffdlasR. The levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1\ufffd\n(IL-1\ufffd) and IL-6, increased following OMV infection. Compared with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lysed OMVs in which the mem-\nbrane structures were broken induced a weak immune response. Furthermore, expression levels of TLR4-mediated responders\n(i.e., cytokines) were markedly downregulated by the TLR4 inhibitor E5564. Active immunization with OMVs or passive transfer\nof sera with a high cytokine quantity acquired from OMV-immunized mice could protect healthy mice against subsequent lethal\nPAO1 challenges (1.5 \ufffd 1011 CFU). Collectively, these findings indicate that naturally secreted P. aeruginosa OMVs may trigger\nsignificant inflammatory responses via the TLR4 signaling pathway and protect mice against pseudomonal lung infection.\n\nSince 1990, lung infections exceeded HIV/AIDS, cancer, andheart diseases and became the greatest cause of disease world-\nwide (1). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic\npathogen, can cause infections in multiple organ systems, and is\nextremely invasive in immunocompromised patients with cystic\nfibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and bronchiecta-\nsis (2\u20134). Like other Gram-negative bacteria, P. aeruginosa can\nsecrete outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as a potential means to\ndeliver virulence factors to distant locations by fusing with lipid\nrafts on the host cell membrane (5\u20137). This has led to growing\nresearch interest in the pathogenesis of OMVs in the past few\nyears.\n\nThe origination of bacterial OMVs was considered a general\nenvelope stress response (8, 9). Natural OMVs are composed of\nouter membrane and periplasmic constituents, including phos-\npholipids, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and proteins as well as sev-\neral virulence factors (10\u201313). LPS can be sensed by Toll-like re-\nceptor 4 (TLR4) on host cells to mount an innate immune\nresponse to Gram-negative bacteria (14, 15). Some LPS can cause\nTLR2-mediated signaling in human cells, which may be attributed\nto the structural difference from the typical hexa-acyl bisphos-\nphorylated format of TLR4-activatable LPS (16, 17). Proteins\nwithin P. aeruginosa secreted vesicles have also been reported to\nplay an important role during infection. Typically, vesicles con-\ntaining cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator\n(CFTR)-inhibitory factor (Cif) can reduce chloride secretion by\ndecreasing the apical expression of CFTR and thereby reducing\nthe mucociliary clearance of pathogens (18, 19).\n\nPrevious research reported that OMVs could elicit heightened\ninnate immune responses by the combined sensing of both LPS\nand protein components (14, 20\u201322). OMVs were shown to be\n\npromising for development of vaccines against infection by the\ncorresponding bacteria (21\u201327). Remarkably, vaccines developed\nbased on Neisseria lactamica OMVs were shown to render effective\nprotection against meningococcal infection and underwent a\nphase I clinical trial for safety and immunogenicity studies with\nadult volunteers (27, 28). OMVs from P. aeruginosa were also\nfound to trigger the production of cytokines in epithelial cells and\nmacrophages (20, 29). These findings suggest that naturally pro-\nduced P. aeruginosa vesicles have the potential to protect the im-\nmunized host against subsequent pseudomonal infection. How-\never, to date, P. aeruginosa OMVs have not been tested for\nimmunization as a vaccine candidate. Hence, in this study, we first\ninvestigated the possibility that OMVs might activate the intercel-\nlular immune response via the TLR4 signaling pathway and then\nexplored the immune protection of OMVs based on a mouse\nmodel. Importantly, P. aeruginosa OMVs were shown to be capa-\nble of protecting immunized mice from lethal challenges with var-\nious concentrations of P. aeruginosa.\n\nReceived 13 August 2013 Returned for modification 6 September 2013\nAccepted 20 September 2013\n\nPublished ahead of print 30 September 2013\n\nEditor: B.

The Pseu-\ndomonas aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type (WT) strain and quorum-sensing\n(QS) defective strain PAO1-\ufffdlasR were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth\nmedium. OMVs produced by WT PAO1 and PAO1-\ufffdlasR were purified by\nusing a differential centrifugation and discontinuous Optiprep (Sigma-\nAldrich) gradient protocol adapted and modified from a protocol de-\nscribed previously by Bauman and Kuehn (29). Briefly, 500 ml of P.\naeruginosa cells was grown to the early stationary phase, and bacterial cells\nwere removed by pelleting at 4\u00b0C (10,000 \ufffd g for 10 min). Supernatants\nwere concentrated via a 100-kDa tangential filtration concentration unit\n(Pall-Gellman), and the retentate was centrifuged and filtered through a\n0.45-\ufffdm-pore-size Durapore polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore).\nVesicles were pelleted (50,000 \ufffd g for 1 h), resuspended in a discontinu-\nous Optiprep gradient, and centrifuged (100,000 \ufffd g for 16 h) again. Pure\nvesicles were recovered from pooled peak fractions by dilution in HEPES\nand pelleting (150,000 \ufffd g for 1 h). Pure vesicles were diluted in phos-\nphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) before use. The components of\nOMVs were visualized by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie blue staining.\n\nCell culture. A549 human lung epithelial cells (ATCC CCL-185) and\nMLE-12 murine lung epithelial cells (ATCC CRL-2110) were obtained\nfrom the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used to examine\nimmune responses induced by the OMVs. A549 cells were grown in Dul-\nbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine\nserum plus penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B (Fungizone) (Invit-\nrogen, CA). Mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S cells (ATCC CRL-2019)\nwere also obtained from the ATCC and were maintained in RPMI\u2013F-12\nmedium (50%:50%) and 2 mM HEPES buffer.\n\nThe innate immune responses of A549 and MLE-12 cells were stud-\nied in the presence of OMVs (0.25 mg/ml) or LPS (Sigma-Aldrich)\nfrom P. aeruginosa (100 ng/ml) or lysed OMVs (0.25 mg/ml), followed\nby incubation until the time of assay. Cells were harvested at desig-\nnated time points and lysed in chilled radioimmunoprecipitation assay\n(RIPA) buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl,\n1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na deoxycholate). OMVs were\nlysed with EDTA (100 mM) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min as described previously\nby Bomberger et al. (6).\n\nCytotoxicity assay. To determine the strain-specific cytotoxicity of P.\naeruginosa OMVs on A549 and MLE-12 cells, confluent cells were har-\nvested and seeded into wells of 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 \ufffd 104\n\ncells/well. Purified vesicles (0.25 mg/ml) of PAO1 or PAO1-\ufffdlasR or PBS\n(10 \ufffdl each) was added to each well and incubated for the indicated time\npoints. Subsequently, cytotoxicity was determined by measuring the\ncellular 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide\n(MTT; Promega) reduction activity according to the method of Abe and\nMatsuki (30). Briefly, MTT was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 2.5\nmg/ml (6 mM) and added to each well so that the final concentration of\nMTT in the medium was 0.25 mg/ml (600 \ufffdM), and the cells were then\nincubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 \ufffdl of a\nsolution containing 50% dimethylformamide and 20% sodium dodecyl\nsulfate (DMF-SDS) (pH 4.7). After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, the\noptical density (OD) was read on a microplate reader at a test wavelength\nof 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 655 nm. The results were calcu-\nlated as the ratio of the mean OD value of experimental groups to that of\nthe control group treated with PBS.\n\nProinflammatory responses in mouse models. We studied the im-\nmune response against P. aeruginosa OMVs in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were\nobtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and housed in the animal facility\nat the University of North Dakota. The animal experiments were ap-\nproved and performed in accordance with institutional animal care and\nuse committee guidelines (University of North Dakota Institutional Ani-\nmal Care and Use Committee [IACUC] approval number 1204-4). Mice\nwere lightly anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of\nketamine HCl (30 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine HCl (15 mg/kg)\n\n(Sigma). Mouse lungs were aseptically removed at 12 h and 24 h after\nintranasal instillation of 0.5 mg purified P. aeruginosa OMVs. The lungs\nwere homogenized by the use of a Branson SLPe digital sonifier cell dis-\nruptor (Fisher Scientific) in chilled RIPA buffer. The homogenate was\ncentrifuged at 20,000 \ufffd g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris.\n\nInhibition of the TLR4 signaling pathway. To confirm the result that\nP. aeruginosa OMVs could trigger the intracellular inflammatory response via\nthe TLR4 signaling pathway, we used E5564 [\ufffd-D-glucopyranose,3-O-decyl-\n2-deoxy-6-O-[2-deoxy-3-O-[(3R)-3-methoxydecyl]-6-O-methyl-2-\n[[(11Z)-1-oxo-11-octadecenyl]amino]-4-O-phosphono-\ufffd-D-\nglucopyranosyl]-2-[(1,3-dioxotetradecyl)amino]-1-(dihydrogen\nphosphate),tetrasodium salt] (formula weight, 1,401.60), a TLR4-directed\nendotoxin antagonist (31) synthesized by Eisai Research Institute of Boston\n(Andover, MA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. MLE-12 cells\nwere seeded in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37\u00b0C.\nThe next day, cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of E5564\n(1 nM and 10 nM) in the presence of P. aeruginosa OMVs at a concentration\nof 0.25 mg/ml for 24 h. Cells treated with same amount of PBS were used as a\ncontrol group. Cells treated with LPS at a concentrations of 100 ng/ml and 10\nnM E5564 were used as a control for E5564. Cells were harvested and lysed in\nchilled RIPA buffer.\n\nImmunization of mice. To explore the immunoprotective potential\nof P. aeruginosa-derived OMVs, 0.5 mg purified PAO1 OMVs were intra-\nnasally instilled into anesthetized C57BL/6J mice on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21,\nand 28. At day 29, sera of immunized mice were collected and preserved at\n\ufffd80\u00b0C. Other groups of immunized mice (5 mice for each group) were\nthen intranasally challenged with P. aeruginosa. To test the protective roles\nof OMV immunization, two challenge doses were then chosen, a dose\n(1.5 \ufffd 109 CFU) sufficient to induce 100% mortality in the absence of\nimmunization and a dose approximately 100 times (1.5 \ufffd 1011 CFU)\nhigher than that. For controls, untreated mice or mice intranasally inoc-\nulated with a single dose of OMVs were also challenged with the same\namount of P. aeruginosa. To test the passive immunity transfer, vesicle-\nimmunized sera with abundant cytokines were diluted into series of con-\ncentrations (5-, 10-, 20-, and 50-fold) and were subcutaneously injected\ninto C57BL/6J mice. Each mouse received 0.2 ml diluted serum by subcu-\ntaneous injection. The next day, serum-injected mice were challenged by\nintranasal instillation of the above-mentioned two concentrations of P.\naeruginosa. Mice subcutaneously injected with either unimmunized sera\nor the sera immunized with a single dose of OMVs were challenged with\nthe same amount of P. aeruginosa as controls. The clinical onset of chal-\nlenged mice was assessed, from reduced activity, fatigue, lethargy, and\nmessy furs to extremely sick (moribund), which was considered dead on\nthat day, and observation was terminated after 10 days. For each experi-\nment, mice injected with the same amount of PBS were also used as a\ncontrol.\n\nWestern blotting. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against TLR2, TLR4,\nand TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing beta inter-\nferon [IFN-\ufffd]); mouse monoclonal antibodies against MyD88, Toll/\nIL-1R domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP), NF-\ufffdB, interleu-\nkin-1\ufffd (IL-1\ufffd), and IL-6; and goat polyclonal IRF-3 (interferon-\nregulatory factor 3) antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, Inc. Mouse monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was purchased from Cell Signal-\ning Technology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibod-\nies were purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals. Western blotting\nwas carried out as described previously (32). Briefly, the samples derived\nfrom cells and tissue homogenates were lysed and quantitated, and the\nlysates were then mixed with a protease inhibitor and boiled for 10 min.\nEqual amounts of each sample were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacryl-\namide minigels and electrophoresed. Subsequently, proteins were trans-\nferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pierce) and blocked in\n5% nonfat milk blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The mem-\nbranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with appropriate primary anti-\nbodies at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers and\n\nZhao et al.\n\n4510 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nRE\nTR\n\nAC\nTE\n\nD \n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n:/\n\n/j\nou\n\nrn\nal\n\ns.\nas\n\nm\n.o\n\nrg\n/j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\n/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n20\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 1\n\n56\n.2\n\n00\n.1\n\n84\n.7\n\n9.\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\nhttp://iai.asm.org/\n\n\nthen washed three times with washing solution and incubated for 2 h with\nthe appropriate secondary antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gil-\nbertsville, PA) at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers.\nFinally, after washing three times with washing solution, blots were devel-\noped with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (SuperSignal\nWest Pico; Pierce) and analyzed by densitometry using ImageJ software.\n\nCell estimation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and histological\nanalysis. Lungs of WT and immunized mouse after a 12-h P. aeruginosa\nchallenge were lavaged 5 times by instilling and withdrawing 1 ml of PBS\nwith an aseptic syringe. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples\nwere collected, mixed to ensure an even suspension, and then stained with\nHEMA-3 (Fisher, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions. Subsequently, 10 \ufffdl of the mixture was pipetted into the wells of a\nhemocytometer for cell differential counting using a light microscope.\nAfter bronchoalveolar lavage procedures, the lungs of WT and OMV-\nimmunized mice were aseptically harvested and fixed in 10% formalin.\nThe paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared on a rotary micro-\ntome and stained with hematoxylin-eosin by using standard techniques\n(33). All sections were examined by light microscopy. To assess bacterial\ndeposition, 1 g lungs or spleens was homogenized in liquid nitrogen,\nfollowed by a brief sonication. Homogenized tissues were fixed in PBS and\nspread onto LB plates for quantitative bacterial culture. Triplicates were\ndone for each sample and control.\n\nQuantitative PCR. Specific primers (Table 1) for IL-1\ufffd, IL-6, and\nGAPDH were designed by using Primer 3.0 software (http://frodo.wi.mit\n.edu/primer3/), based on the consensus of sequences that are deposited in\nGenBank. Mouse lungs were collected after challenge with 0.5 mg PAO1\nOMVs for 12 and 24 h. Lungs were lysed and quantitated, and the lysates\nwere ultrasonically disrupted. Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol\nreagent, followed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR using a\nQiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s in-\nstructions. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Gene expression\nwas calculated by using the 2\ufffd\ufffdCT method (34) and normalized to\nGAPDH levels in each sample.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokine protein production\n(tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\ufffd], IL-1\ufffd, and IL-6) in the serum of\nOMV-challenged mice was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosor-\nbent assay (ELISA), using ELISA kits (eBioscience Co., San Diego, CA)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All the experiments were\nperformed in triplicate.\n\nConfocal fluorescence microscopy. Purified OMVs were resuspended\nin labeling buffer (50 mM Na2CO3, 100 mM NaCl [pH 9.2]), and X-rhoda-\nmine-5-(and -6)-isothiocyanate [5(6)-XRITC] (Molecular Probes) was\nadded at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for 1 h at 25\u00b0C, followed by ultracentrif-\nugation at 52,000 \ufffd g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. To visualize the phagocytosis of\nmurine alveolar macrophages toward P. aeruginosa OMVs, 0.1 \ufffd 106 MH-S\nalveolar macrophages were seeded overnight on collagen-coated, glass-bot-\ntom MatTek dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and then exposed to labeled\nvesicles for 5 min and 15 min. The unbound vesicles were washed off with\nPBS, and the cells were surface stained with the lipid raft marker Alexa Fluor\n488 (green; Molecular Probes) and visualized by confocal microscopy.\n\nData analysis and statistics. The density of the Western blot bands\nwas determined by using ImageJ software. Data and statistical tests were\ncomputed by using Graphpad Prism version 5.0 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA).\nMeans were compared by using Student\u2019s t test or one-way analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA), followed by a Tukey-Kramer post hoc test using a 95% con-\nfidence interval. Data are presented as means \t standard errors of the means\n(SEM). A chi-square test with Yates\u2019 correction was used to compare the\nsurvival rates between immunized mice and the unimmunized group.\n\nRESULTS\nOMVs generated from P. aeruginosa PAO1 or PAO1-\ufffdlasR\nwere cytotoxic to epithelial cells. In order to study the pathogenic\nrole of OMVs, we used a protocol established previously by Bau-\nman and Kuehn (29) to purify and characterize OMVs. To ac-\ncount for the impact of pathogenic factors on immunogenicity, we\nisolated OMVs from P. aeruginosa WT strain PAO1 and a quo-\nrum-sensing-deficient strain, PAO1-\ufffdlasR. SDS-PAGE results\nshowed that the components of the two purified OMVs were al-\nmost identical, except for a band corresponding to the known\nmolecular mass of OprD (48 kDa), as also previously reported by\nBauman and Kuehn (29), in the low-density fractions of PAO1\nOMVs (Fig. 1A and B). To test the cytotoxic effect of the naturally\nsecreted OMVs, we employed human alveolar epithelial A549 cells\nand murine alveolar epithelial MLE-12 cells, as both cell types are\nmodels commonly used in culture to test host-pathogen interac-\ntions (35, 36). OMVs derived from either PAO1 or PAO1-\ufffdlasR\nwere cytotoxic to both A549 and MLE-12 cells after a delay of 8 h\nof incubation (Fig. 1C and D). These results were consistent with\ndata reported previously by Bomberger et al. (6), showing that the\nP. aeruginosa-produced OMVs were capable of causing cytotoxic-\nity on epithelial cells. Moreover, it seemed that the OMVs from\nPAO1 were more cytotoxic to A549 cells than those from PAO1-\n\ufffdlasR after 10 h of treatment (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we chose WT P.\naeruginosa for the following experiments, which might elicit vig-\norous cellular proinflammatory responses.\n\nP. aeruginosa OMVs triggered proinflammatory responses\nin vitro and in vivo via the TLR4 signaling pathway. To deter-\nmine the innate immune response induced by P. aeruginosa\nOMVs, we first detected the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 after\nchallenging respiratory epithelial cells with LPS and OMVs, re-\nspectively. We noted that the expression of TLR4 (but not TLR2)\nincreased significantly in A549 cells with challenge of OMVs or\nLPS from P. aeruginosa (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).\nThese findings suggested that the purified OMVs could induce\ninnate immune responses via the TLR4 signaling pathway, which\nmight be attributed to the properties of LPS. To further test this\nhypothesis, we evaluated several signaling proteins associated with\nthe TLR4 pathway using Western blotting. As expected, we found\nthat the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-\ufffdB increased\nin both A549 and MLE-12 cells after incubation with P. aeruginosa\nOMVs for 24 h, and the level of IL-1\ufffd was increased in MLE-12\ncells (Fig. 2A to D). However, no significant difference in the ex-\npression levels of TRIF and IRF-3 was observed (see Fig. S2 in the\nsupplemental material). These results indicated that an OMV\ncomplex of P. aeruginosa might be required to elicit a vigorous\nimmune response in epithelial cells in vitro via a MyD88-depen-\ndent TLR4 signaling pathway. Since E5564 is a widely used TLR4-\ndirected endotoxin antagonist (31), we set up to confirm the P.\naeruginosa OMV-induced TLR4 signaling pathway with E5564 to\nexamine the impact when blocking TLR4. The expression of\nTLR4-related signaling proteins, such as MyD88, NF-\ufffdB, and IL-\n\nTABLE 1 Primers for quantitative PCR used in this studya\n\nGene assayed Primer sequence\n\nIL-1\ufffd 5=-TCATTGTGGCTGTGGAGAAG-3= (forward)\n5=-CATCTCGGAGCCTGTAGTGC-3= (reverse)\n\nIL-6 5=-CTTGGGACTGATGCTGGTGA-3= (forward)\n5=-CATTTCCACGATTTCCCAGA-3= (reverse)\n\nGAPDH 5=-CTGCCCAGAACATCATCCCT-3= (forward)\n5=-TGAAGTCGCAGGAGACAACC-3= (reverse)\n\na These primers were designed in this study.\n\nOMVs Modulate Host Immune Responses via TLR4 Signaling\n\nDecember 2013 Volume 81 Number 12 iai.asm.org 4511\n\nRE\nTR\n\nAC\nTE\n\nD \n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n:/\n\n/j\nou\n\nrn\nal\n\ns.\nas\n\nm\n.o\n\nrg\n/j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\n/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n20\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 1\n\n56\n.2\n\n00\n.1\n\n84\n.7\n\n9.\n\nhttp://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/\nhttp://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/\nhttp://iai.asm.org\nhttp://iai.asm.org/\n\n\n1\ufffd, was abolished by incubation with 10 nM E5564 for 24 h com-\npared with sham controls. Indeed, blocking of TLR4 led MLE-12\ncells to fail to respond against the challenge of P. aeruginosa OMVs\n(Fig. 2E and F). To further determine the downstream factors of\nthe OMV-induced immune response, we explored the OMV-elic-\nited signaling pathway using mouse models. After intranasally\nchallenging C57BL/6J mice with OMVs 6 times, as described in\nMaterials and Methods, we determined the levels of production of\nTLR4, TIRAP, and NF-\ufffdB, which increased 1.5- to 4-fold at 12 and\n24 h in comparison with the sham-treated mice (Fig. 3). These\ndata were consistent with data reported previously by Lee et al.\nconcerning the OMVs of Escherichia coli (21). Due to the consis-\ntent observations from both in vitro and in vivo studies, we con-\nclude that P. aeruginosa OMVs could efficiently stimulate the re-\nlease of inflammatory mediators in the mouse model and that the\nimmune response might be dependent on the TLR4 pathway.\n\nThese studies prompted us to surmise that the activation of\nimmune responses was attributed primarily to the existence of\nLPS rather than intracellular virulence factors within OMVs. To\ntest our hypothesis, OMVs were lysed with 100 mM EDTA and\nthen used to stimulate A549 and MLE-12 cells in parallel with LPS.\nInterestingly, in contrast to LPS, the production of cytokines such\nas IL-1\ufffd and IL-6 was impaired by lysed OMVs (Fig. 4), suggesting\nthat the development of cellular proinflammatory responses re-\nquires intact OMVs. Furthermore, we also found that there were\nDNA species by agarose electrophoresis (data not shown), using\nthe boiled vesicles generated from both P. aeruginosa strains,\n\nwhich is consistent with studies reported previously by Renelli et\nal. (37). A large body of literature reported that the presence of the\nCpG motif in bacterial DNA could be recognized by TLR9 to\ntrigger inflammatory responses (37\u201340). Thus, we evaluated the\ninduction of TLR9 using OMV-derived DNA and OMV lysates.\nHowever, no significant changes in TLR9 expression and cytokine\nproduction were observed by using various concentrations of\nDNA and OMV lysates (data not shown), and the function of\nOMV-associated DNA remains unknown (53).\n\nProtective roles of P. aeruginosa OMVs against experimental\ninfection with P. aeruginosa. To further characterize the immune\nproperties of the isolated OMVs, we next tested the hypothesis\nthat P. aeruginosa OMV-induced serum could protect rodents\nfrom subsequent infection by P. aeruginosa strains. First, sera of P.\naeruginosa OMV-challenged mice were collected to measure the\ninflammatory cytokine levels. We found that the concentrations\nof TNF-\ufffd, IL-1\ufffd, and IL-6 increased significantly at 24 h after the\nlast OMV challenge (Fig. 5). As shown in Table 2, P. aeruginosa\nOMV-immunized C57BL/6J mice (5 per group) survived until the\nend of the experiments after challenge with P. aeruginosa at a lethal\nconcentration (1.5 \ufffd 109 CFU) and even at concentrations 100-\nfold higher than this dose. The progression of infection in unim-\nmunized mice or mice immunized with a single dose of OMVs was\nrapid, with no survivors at 24 h postchallenge, whereas mice im-\nmunized with OMVs 6 times survived the bacterial challenges.\nThese results indicate that P. aeruginosa OMVs could efficiently\nstimulate the release of inflammatory factors in mouse models to\n\nFIG 1 P. aeruginosa PAO1- and PAO1-\ufffdlasR-generated OMVs elicited time-dependent cytotoxicity in lung epithelial cells.

More-\nover, the immunized mice significantly eliminated invading bac-\nteria and recruited neutrophils and macrophages to the lungs\nagainst P. aeruginosa challenge compared to unimmunized con-\ntrol mice (Fig. 6). To evaluate the mechanism of immune protec-\ntion, we attempted to determine the protective potential of OMVs\nin naive mice by a passive immunity transfer of the sera of OMV-\nimmunized mice. The serum of an individual mouse with high-\nlevel cytokine production was then serially diluted and injected\ninto C57BL/6J mice subcutaneously. We found that serum-vacci-\nnated mice were protected from P. aeruginosa challenges with var-\nious CFU. After the serum vaccination, mice were again chal-\nlenged with a lethal dose (1.5 \ufffd 109 CFU) of P. aeruginosa and\n\nwere completely protected from death versus the control mice\nthat received sham treatments (PBS, unimmunized serum, or\nserum from mice immunized with a single dose of OMVs). We\nthen increased the amount of P. aeruginosa to 1.5 \ufffd 1011 CFU\nto further assess the protection efficacy. Mice were also com-\npletely protected by the serum, which was diluted 5- and 10-\nfold. However, for the mice that received serum that was di-\nluted 20-fold, 1 mouse out of 5 mice died. In contrast, control\nmice that received unimmunized serum and serum from mice\nimmunized with only one dose of OMVs were all dead after\nchallenge with either concentration of P. aeruginosa (Table 3).\nTherefore, P. aeruginosa-generated OMVs may be capable of\nprotecting mice from P. aeruginosa lung infection.\n\nFIG 2 P. aeruginosa OMVs trigger intracellular inflammatory responses via the TLR4 signaling pathway.

Despite\n\nintense interest, the precise role of OMVs in inducing host patho-\nphysiology remains to be fully determined, and P. aeruginosa\nOMVs have not been tested for immunizing potency and vaccine\npurposes. The current study demonstrated for the first time that P.\n\nFIG 3 P. aeruginosa PAO1-generated OMVs increase the expression levels of TLR4 pathway immunogenically related proteins, including TLR4, TIRAP, NF-\ufffdB,\nIL-1\ufffd, and IL-6, in C57BL/6J mouse lungs, as determined by Western blotting (A and B) and quantitative PCR (C).

Bauman and Kuehn found previously that the aminopeptidase\nPaAP (PA2939) or PepB was highly enriched in vesicles generated\nfrom a cystic fibrosis (CF) isolate (29). P. aeruginosa possesses two\nhierarchically superimposed and well-characterized QS systems,\nlas and rhl, controlling the synthesis and secretion of a number of\nvirulence factors during infection. Especially, the existence of the\nQS molecule 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone in OMVs sug-\ngested that the QS system might be implicated in the packaging of\nOMVs (13, 41). In this study, the difference between the OMVs\ngenerated by PAO1 and those generated by PAO1-\ufffdlasR was an-\nalyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the components were almost identical\nexcept for a band of approximately 48 kDa, which might be OprD\nin PAO1 OMVs (Fig. 1A). Previously, porin was shown to be\nrelated to imipenem and carbapenem resistance (42, 43). It is cur-\nrently unclear why the vesicles from WT PAO1 caused more cy-\ntotoxicity to alveolar epithelial cells than did those from PAO1-\n\ufffdlasR (Fig. 1C). It is likely that additional virulence factors in\nOMVs have yet to be identified. In addition, complicated bacterial\nvirulence factors, including unannotated proteins, may be re-\nsponsible for environmental stresses and can also influence the\noutcome of infection (44). Nevertheless, our results suggested\n\nthat the QS system might be involved in the process of OMV\npackaging.\n\nWhole bacterial organisms can activate TLR4 signaling and\ninitiate vigorous immune responses, including phagocytosis and\ncytokine production, following P. aeruginosa infection, while\nTLR2 may have different immune functions (45\u201347). The litera-\nture also showed that OMVs generated from a wide range of bac-\nteria can elicit the production of various cytokines by epithelial\ncells (48, 49). In Neisseria meningitides, LPS acts as an adjuvant to\nthe components of vesicles and can profoundly modulate inflam-\nmatory responses of macrophages in a TLR4-dependent manner\n(21, 22, 25). The current study provided a detailed in vitro and in\nvivo mechanism for the stimulation of proinflammatory media-\ntors by P. aeruginosa OMVs that was TLR4 dependent (Fig. 2 and\n3). The OMV-triggered signaling pathway observed was essen-\ntially the same as purified P. aeruginosa LPS (Fig. 2 and 4). Inter-\nestingly, no significant difference was observed for the production\nof immune mediators triggered by PAO1 OMVs and PAO1-\ufffdlasR\n(Fig. 2), indicating that although QS might be associated with the\npackaging and cytotoxicity of OMVs, this master QS regulator\nmay not be a key factor for activating proinflammatory responses.\nOur previous study indicated that P. aeruginosa infection was de-\npendent on lipid raft-mediated membrane signals (50). Bomb-\nerger et al. also found that OMV virulence factors were delivered\ninto the host cell cytoplasm by fusing with lipid rafts (6). As shown\nby our confocal microcopy results, vesicles were initially colocal-\nized with lipid raft microdomains on the cell surface and then\nrapidly internalized into the cytoplasm (see Fig. S3 in the supple-\nmental material). When the lysed OMVs of P. aeruginosa were\nincubated with A549 and MLE-12 cells, the expression levels of\ncytokines, particularly IL-1\ufffd, decreased significantly (Fig. 4).\nHowever, the changes in expression levels of MyD88, NF-\ufffdB, and\nIL-6 were less prominent. Although there was also some residual\nLPS, the OMVs with lysed membranes could not efficiently acti-\nvate immune responses. In addition to the significantly increased\nlevel of production of TLR4-mediated responders elicited by in-\ntact OMVs (Fig. 2), we reasoned that the OMVs lacking an intact\nmembrane may have lost the ability to target lipid rafts, which in\nturn prevents the vesicle components from being delivered into\nthe cytoplasm to induce the production of proinflammatory fac-\ntors. Therefore, the activation of the host immune response elic-\nited by P. aeruginosa OMVs is dependent primarily on LPS via the\nTLR4 signaling pathway but requires an intact membrane struc-\n\nFIG 5 Production of proinflammatory cytokines in sera of OMV-treated mice, as determined by ELISA.

Vaccines that effectively prevent P. aeruginosa\npulmonary infections could be very useful, and previous studies\nsuggested that LPS is an influential effector in the development of\nvaccines in mice (20\u201322, 51). Ramphal et al. also showed that\nPseudomonas LPS is not a key virulence factor in acute pneumonia\nand thus can be used as an adjuvant to trigger a prominent proin-\nflammatory response and effectively defend the lung from P.\naeruginosa infection (52). Thus, in this study, we immunized mice\nwith a series of intranasal challenges to evaluate the vaccine po-\ntential of OMVs against pseudomonal lung infection. We found\n\nthat P. aeruginosa OMVs almost fully protected mice against P.\naeruginosa challenge at 1.5 \ufffd 109 CFU and even at a 100-fold-\nhigher concentration of this inoculum. All the OMV-immunized\nmice survived after challenge with a lethal concentration of P.\naeruginosa (Table 2). Additionally, the sera of OMV-immunized\nmice contained increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines\n(Fig. 5) and could also be passively transferred to protect other\nmice from death against subsequent P. aeruginosa challenges (Ta-\nble 3). Currently, the detailed mechanism for OMVs in inducing\nenhanced immunity remains to be fully determined. As our study\nis the first to clearly reveal the immune protective effect of P.\naeruginosa OMVs, further mechanistic studies of their immuniza-\ntion potential might facilitate the development of more efficient\nand broadly protective vaccines for pseudomonal diseases.\n\nFIG 6 Bacterial burden and BALF cell counts following P. aeruginosa challenge.

P. aeruginosa-generated OMVs also efficiently\nstimulated the release of murine inflammatory factors via the\nTLR4 signaling pathway requiring LPS. Importantly, P. aeruginosa\nOMVs were confirmed to be capable of protecting immunized\nmice from a subsequent lethal P. aeruginosa challenge. Unlike P.\naeruginosa, OMVs had a significantly reduced virulence reper-\ntoire, thus drastically reducing safety concerns if applied in clinics.\nTherefore, a prospective vaccine based on OMVs may also offer\nenhanced safety, improved immunogenicity, and elevated efficacy\nfor prevention of pseudomonal diseases.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the China Scholarship Council (grant\n201206240130 to K.Z.) for supporting this work.
