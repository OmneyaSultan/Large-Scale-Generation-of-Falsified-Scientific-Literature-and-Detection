Because NK cells have a protective role\nagainst this infection (16), we measured their lev-\nels at 3 days pi. Notably, both the percentage and\ntotal numbers of these cells were decreased in the\nuteri of Ifn-e\u2212/\u2212 mice (fig. S6, A and B). Impor-\ntantly, there were no changes in Ifn-e RNA ex-\npression at the early or late stages of the infection\n(fig. S6C), consistent with our in vitro data show-\ning that Ifn-e is not regulated by PRR pathways.\nFurthermore, production of Ifn-b and IRGs was\nhigher than the levels in WT mice (fig. S7, A to\nD), indicating that the protective effects of Ifn-e\nwere not solely due to priming for the production\nof other type I IFNs. To demonstrate that Ifn-e\ncould directly mediate protection against infec-\ntion, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in\nbacteria (Fig. 4E), demonstrating that reconstitu-\ntion of (progesterone) lowered Ifn-e levels pro-\ntected against this bacterial infection.\n\nThe distinct properties of IFN-e, compared\nwith other type I IFNs (table S2), make IFN-e the\nonly one that protects againstChlamydia, whereas\nthe others exacerbate disease (17\u201320). All type I\nIFNs protect against HSV-2 infection (21, 22),\nwith IFN-e likely contributing because its consti-\ntutive expression by epithelial cells offers imme-\ndiate efficacy at the site of first contact of mucosal\npathogens. Interestingly, the increased suscepti-\nbility to FRT infections of women on progestagen-\ncontaining contraception (23, 24) may be explained\nby the lowering of Ifn-e levels (fig. S8A) during\nprogestin pretreatment that is required for all FRT\ninfection models (25, 26). The local effect of\n\nIFN-e is supported by our observation that IFN-e\nmakes no difference in a systemic model (fig. S8,\nB to D). Consistent with the importance of IFN-e\nin FRT immunity, IFN-e is evolutionarily conserved\nin eutherian mammals, particularly in residues\npredicted to contact the two receptor components\n(fig. S9) (27). Because STIs are major global\nhealth and socioeconomic problems, the distinc-\ntive regulatory and protective properties of IFN-e\nmay facilitate the development of new strategies\nfor preventing and treating STIs and, perhaps,\nother diseases.\n\nReferences and Notes\n1.

Here, we describe\na previously unknown signaling pathway between stressed neurons and trigeminal afferents during\ncortical spreading depression (CSD), the putative cause of migraine aura and headache. CSD\ncaused neuronal Pannexin1 (Panx1) megachannel opening and caspase-1 activation followed\nby high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release from neurons and nuclear factor kB activation in\nastrocytes. Suppression of this cascade abolished CSD-induced trigeminovascular activation, dural\nmast cell degranulation, and headache. CSD-induced neuronal megachannel opening may promote\nsustained activation of trigeminal afferents via parenchymal inflammatory cascades reaching glia\nlimitans. This pathway may function to alarm an organism with headache when neurons are stressed.\n\nT\nhere is agreement that activation of the\ntrigeminocervical complex mediates mi-\ngraine headache, whereas the brain event\n\nthat initiates migraine is unclear (1\u20133). Cortical\nspreading depression (CSD) thought to cause the\nmigraine aura may activate perivascular trigem-\ninal nerves (4\u201310) by way of potassium, protons,\nnitric oxide (NO), arachidonic acid, and adenosine\n\n5\u00b4-triphosphate released during CSD (3, 8, 11).\nHowever, sufficient concentrations of these medi-\nators may not be sustained in the perivascular\nspace for trigeminal sensitization and hours-lasting\nheadache (10, 12) because of the glia limitans bar-\nrier and continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow.\nTrigeminal meningeal nociceptors and central neu-\nrons also start firing ~14 and 25 min after CSD in\n\nthe rat (10, 13). Similarly, there is a 20- to 30-min\ndelay between the end of the aura and the headache\n(14). Such time lags may be required for transduc-\ntion of algesic signals over glia limitans via in-\nflammatory mediators. Intense depolarization\nandN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor over-\nactivation opens neuronal Pannexin1 (Panx1) mega-\nchannels (15\u201317). These conditions are present\nduring CSD and suggest that CSD, by activating\nPanx1 and downstream inflammasome formation,\nmay trigger inflammation (17, 18). We therefore\nhypothesize that stress-induced Panx1 activation\nmay cause headache by releasing pro-inflammatory\nmediators such as high-mobility group box 1\n(HMGB1) from neurons, which initiates a paren-\nchymal inflammatory response, leading to sustained\nrelease of inflammatorymediators fromglia limitans\nand, hence, prolonged trigeminal stimulation.\n\nPropidium iodide (PI) is a membrane-\nimpermeable fluoroprobe used to monitor activ-\nity as it passes through megachannels such as\n\n1Institute of Neurological Sciences and Psychiatry, Hacettepe\nUniversity, Ankara 06100, Turkey. 2Department of Neurology,\nFaculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara 06100,\nTurkey. 3Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe\nUniversity, Ankara 06100, Turkey.\n\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

CSD induces NF-kB translocation reversed\nby inhibition of Panx1 channels or HMGB1. (A and\nB) Western blotting of cytoplasmic and nuclear\nbrain fractions shows that CSD induces translocation\nof NF-kB from cytoplasm to nucleus in cortex within\n30 min.

Unlike groups in (A), BoxA and antibody\nto HMGB1 (B) were injected intracortically just\nbefore CSD without any prior injections to the brain\n(19); hence, they exhibited different NF-kB levels.\n(C) Thirty min after CSD, astrocytes identified with\nALDH1L1 immunoreactivity (red) displayed nuclear\nNF-kB\u2013immunoreactivity (green nuclei, arrows),\nunlike normal cytoplasmic NF-kB immunostaining\nseen in neurons (N).

In mouse brain in vivo, single or\nmultiple CSDs triggered by pinprick or KCl caused\nPI influx to cortical and dentate neurons (95 T 3%,\nmean T SEM, of PI-labeled cells were NeuN-\npositive) (Fig. 1). PI uptakewas inhibited by Panx1\nchannel blockers carbenoxolone (CBX) [400 ng\nintracerebroventricularly (icv)], probenecid (60 mg\nicv), 10Panx (100 mM intracortical), or Panx1\u2013small\ninterfering RNA (siRNA) (Fig. 1, M and N, and\nfig. S1) (19). Vehicle alone or nonsilencing siRNA\nhad no effect. CBX and 10Panx did not affect CSD\ngeneration and propagation, suggesting that pre-\nvention of PI uptake was not caused by CSD sup-\npression (Fig. 1). No PI uptake was observed in\nastrocytes (fig. S2A). PI labeling was maximal\n5 min after CSD and disappeared in an hour,\npossibly because of active extrusion of PI from\nlive cells in vivo. PI uptake was not caused by\nintracerebroventricular injection (19) because\nit could be inhibited when CSD generation was\nsuppressed by epiduralMK-801 application to the\npinprick site. During CSD, cells did not take up\nFITC-dextran-70S, which is also membrane im-\npermeable but too large to pass through mega-\n\nchannels, indicating that PI influx was not due to\nosmotic rupture of the plasma membrane (ad-\nditional control experiments are available in the\nsupplementary text).\n\nCaspase-1 was activated in 99.2 T 0.2% of\nPI-positive neurons 5 min after CSD (Fig. 1H).\nCaspase-1 activation initiates inflammation by\nreleasing HMGB1 and interleukin-1b (IL-1b)\n(17, 18, 20). Indeed, CSF collected from lateral\nventricles of mice subjected to CSDs for 1 hour\nshowed a 10-fold HMGB1 and 24-fold IL-1b in-\ncrease in Western blots (Fig. 1I). HMGB1\u2013short\nhairpin RNA (shRNA) suppressed HMGB1 re-\nlease to CSF (19) (Fig. 1I and fig. S3). Double-\nstaining of brain sections illustrated that 88.0 T\n0.1% and 52 T 4% of neurons were HMGB1-\npositive 5 and 30min after a single CSD, although\nall neuronal nuclei wereHMGB1-positivewithout\nCSD (Fig. 1, J and K). CBX abolished cleaved\ncaspase-1 immunoreactivity and HMGB1 trans-\nlocation in addition to inhibiting PI-positivity\n(Fig. 1, L to N).\n\nCSD also induced nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)\nactivation; most astrocytes (82 T 6%) exhibited\n\nnuclear NF-kB translocation 30 min after CSD\n(Fig. 2). CBX inhibited NF-kB translocation,\nsuggesting that the signal leading to NF-kB trans-\nlocation was initiated by the opening of Panx1\nchannels and release of HMGB1 (Fig. 2A and\nfigs. S2B and S4). Indeed, NF-kB translocation\nwas also inhibited with neutralizing antibody to\nHMGB1; BoxA, a fragment of HMGB1 with\nantagonistic activity; or HMGB1-shRNA (Fig. 2\nand fig. S2C) (19). Astrocytes forming glia limitans\nalso showed nuclear NF-kB translocation followed\nby cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and inducible ni-\ntric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction after CSD,\nwhich can provide the sustained inflammatory me-\ndiator release to subarachnoid space (Fig. 2, C to F).\n\nAs reported in the rat (8), CSD induced an\nearly, brief (21 T 1 s) flow increase followed by a\nlate (peak latency; 21 T 2 min) but sustained (51 T\n3 min) blood flow elevation in ipsilateral middle\nmeningeal artery (MMA) in mice (Fig. 3). CSD-\ninduced late MMA dilation, which is initiated\nby activation of the trigeminal nerves around pial\nvessels (8), was completely inhibited with CBX\n(Fig. 3D), suggesting that Panx1 channel opening\n\nFig. 3. Inhibition of Panx1 channels or inflamma-\ntory mediators suppresses trigeminovascular acti-\nvation. (A) Speckle contrast images of the MMA and\ncortex were captured through thinned skull (inset,\ngreen rectangular area) before CSD. Color bar in (C)\nindicates the relative blood flow change to base-\nline. (B) The relative blood flow image obtained\n2 min after pinprick-induced CSD shows the early\ncortical oligemia (blue) spreading from anterior to\nposterior. (C) Twenty-five min after CSD, there is\nselective flow increase in the MMA (red arrow),\nwhereas the cortex is still hypoperfused. (D and\nE) The time course of blood flow changes in the\nipsilateral MMA and cortex after CSD (vertical bars\nTSEM). Late blood flow elevation in MMA was in-\nhibited with CBX. CBX did not affect cortical blood\nflow (E) or early and brief MMA flow increase, which\n(F) can be correctly displayed only with an expanded\ntime scale (19). (G and H) CSD-induced late MMA\nflow increase was also suppressed by HMGB1-shRNA,\nNF-kB inhibitor, probenecid, and naproxen. Dia-\nmonds indicate significant difference (P < 0.05) as\ncompared with corresponding controls (black dia-\nmonds; P < 0.07). CBX treatment and HMGB1 si-\nlencing also inhibited CSD-induced dural MAST\ncell degranulation, another manifestation of the\ntrigeminovascular activation. (I) The dura with mast\ncells concentrated along the course of MMA. Scale\nbar, 100 mm. ( J and K) Examples of a resting and\na degranulated mast cell, respectively.

(M) CSD-induced\npain was assessed by means of mouse grimace scale.\nMean difference scores from the baseline show that\nrepeated CSDs induced by a KCl pellet over the dura\ncaused pain-related mimics, which was significantly\nsuppressed by CBX pretreatment. In the sham group,\nsaline was applied over the dura.\n\n1 MARCH 2013 VOL 339 SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org1094\n\nREPORTS Corrected 25 September 2015; see full text.\nD\n\now\nnloaded from\n\n https://w\nw\n\nw\n.science.org on A\n\npril 03, 2022\n\n\n\nand downstream inflammatory cascade play a\nrole in trigeminal activation. The effect of CBX\nwas not due to a direct vascular action or blockade\nof gap junctions because CSD-induced CBF\nchanges, early MMA dilation, and Ca+2 rise in\nastrocytic syncytium were not altered by CBX\n(Fig. 3, E and F, and fig. S5) (19). Interrupting\nthis signaling cascade with another Panx1 in-\nhibitor, probenecid or HMGB1-shRNA, or NF-kB\nactivation inhibitor 4-methyl-N1-(3-phenylpropyl)\nbenzene-1,2-diamine suppressed the late MMA\ndilation (Fig. 3, G and H). Naproxen (40 mg/kg\nintraperitoneally), a prostaglandin synthase in-\nhibitor, also suppressed the MMA response.\nMoreover, CSD-induced dural mast cell degran-\nulation, another manifestation of the trigeminal\nactivation (21, 22), was significantly reduced by\nCBX and HMGB1-shRNA (Fig. 3, I to L). Last,\nwe assessed the headache-like behavior induced\nby repeated CSDs (which also induced PI influx\nand nuclear NF-kB translocation) (19) with ameth-\nod based on scoring facial grimace (23). Placement\nof a KCl-pellet over dura in freely moving mice\ncaused pain-related mimics unlike saline-applied,\nsham-operated mice. CSD-induced pain was re-\nversed by means of CBX treatment (Fig. 3M).\n\nThese data show that CSD opens neuronal\nPanx1 channels as reported during in vitro ische-\nmia, NMDA over-activation, and aberrant bursting\n(17). Activation of Panx1 by cellular stressors such\nas excess potassium or glutamate stimulates the\ninflammasome complex, subsequent caspase-1 ac-\ntivation, and IL-1b production (17, 18), suggesting\nthat Panx1 megachannels may play a role as a\nreporter linking neuronal stress to inflammatory\nresponse. Similarly, CSD induced caspase-1 acti-\nvation and HMGB1 release from neurons whose\nPanx1 channels were activated.\n\nHMGB1 is a member of the alarmin family,\nwhich mediates the communication between in-\njured and surrounding cells (24). HMGB1 is\npassively released from necrotic cells and ac-\ntively secreted by cells under distress (25, 26).\nHMGB1 behaves like a cytokine and promotes\ninflammation when released (27, 28). Therefore,\nHMGB1 and IL-1b released during CSDmay take\npart in initiation of the inflammatory response.\nSubsequent NF-kB activation in astrocytes may\ninduce formation of cytokines, prostanoids, and\ninducible NO synthase-derived NO (as suggested\nby inhibition of MMA response by naproxen and\nCSD-induced COX2 and iNOS expression in glia\nlimitans), which may be released to the sub-\narachnoid space via glia limitans and, hence,\nstimulate trigeminal nerve endings around pial\nvessels (fig. S6). By promoting sustained head-\nache, HMGB1 may thus serve to alarm the orga-\nnism that the brain parenchyma has been stressed\nby CSD or CSD-like events. HMGB1 is most\nlikely not the only mediator playing this role; other\ncytokines as well as cells (such as microglia) may\nalso take part along the course of inflammatory\nresponse (29, 30). In contrast to mediators such as\npotassium and protons that are transiently released\nduring CSD, activation of the parenchymal in-\n\nflammatory pathways may provide the sustained\nstimulus required for sensitization of trigeminal\nnerve endings and lasting pain as suggested by\nsuppression of long-lasting MMAvasodilatation,\nmast cell degranulation, and importantly, headache-\nlike behavior by interrupting the inflammatory\ncascade at one of the steps (11).\n\nWe propose a previously unknown link be-\ntween a noxious intrinsic brain event and activa-\ntion of the trigeminal pain fibers, involving the\nopening of Panx1 megachannels on stressed neu-\nrons, subsequent activation of the inflammatory\npathways, and transduction of this signal to the\ntrigeminal nerves around pial vessels (fig. S6).\n\nReferences and Notes\n1. M. A. Moskowitz, Headache 48, 688 (2008).\n2. P. J. Goadsby, Trends Mol. Med. 13, 39 (2007).\n3. J. Olesen, R. Burstein, M. Ashina, P.

Evidence is lacking for the cumulative\nimpact of such prenatal and postnatal environmental challenges on brain functions and\nvulnerability to psychiatric disease. Here, we show in a translational mouse model that combined\nexposure to prenatal immune challenge and peripubertal stress induces synergistic pathological\neffects on adult behavioral functions and neurochemistry. We further demonstrate that the\nprenatal insult markedly increases the vulnerability of the pubescent offspring to brain immune\nchanges in response to stress. Our findings reveal interactions between two adverse environmental\nfactors that have individually been associated with neuropsychiatric disease and support theories\nthat mental illnesses with delayed onsets involve multiple environmental hits.\n\nP\nrenatal maternal infection and postnatal ex-\nposure to psychological trauma are two\nenvironmental risk factors for developmen-\n\ntal psychiatric disorders, including autism, schizo-\nphrenia, and bipolar disorder (1\u20134). In spite of\ntheir relatively frequent occurrence (5\u20137), both\nfactors seem to have rather modest effect sizes\n\nin large populations (4, 8, 9). For example, the\nglobal incidence of schizophrenia after influenza\npandemics only increases marginally (relative risk\nratios of 1 to 2.5) even though 20 to 50% of the\ngeneral population is typically infected during\ninfluenza pandemics (9, 10). It has therefore been\nproposed that developmental stressors, such as\n\nwww.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 339 1 MARCH 2013 1095\n\nREPORTSCorrected 25 September 2015; see full text.\nD\n\now\nnloaded from\n\n https://w\nw\n\nw\n.science.org on A\n\npril 03, 2022\n\n\n\nUse of this article is subject to the Terms of service\n\nScience (ISSN 1095-9203) is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 1200 New York Avenue NW,\nWashington, DC 20005.
