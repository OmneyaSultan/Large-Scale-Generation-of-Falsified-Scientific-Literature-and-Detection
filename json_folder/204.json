Using a transgenic mouse\nmodel, we found that expression of the intracellular domain of Notch 1 (NICD) in mouse livers results in the\nformation of intrahepatic CCCs. These tumors display features of bipotential hepatic progenitor cells, indi-\ncating that intrahepaticCCCcan originate from this cell type.We show that human andmouseCCCsare char-\nacterized by high expression of the cyclin E protein and identified the cyclin E gene as a direct transcriptional\ntarget of the Notch signaling pathway. Intriguingly, blocking g-secretase activity in human CCC xenotrans-\nplants results in downregulation of cyclin E expression, induction of apoptosis, and tumor remission in vivo.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) is a primary liver cancer with\n\nbiliary differentiation (Patel, 2006). Several recent studies\n\ndescribe a significant increase in the incidence of this tumor in\n\nEurope and the United States; the reasons for this increase are\n\nnot understood (El-Serag et al., 2009; von Hahn et al., 2011;\n\nWest et al., 2006). Even though CCC accounts for up to 15%\n\nof all liver cancers, the molecular alterations that lead to this\n\ndisease are mostly unknown. Predisposing conditions such as\n\nprimary sclerosing cholangitis, chronic infection with liver flukes,\n\nor biliary stones led to the hypothesis that chronic inflammation\n\nof the biliary epithelium might be a prerequisite for the formation\n\nof CCC. However, no uniform genetic alteration has been identi-\n\nfied that is responsible for the formation of CCC. In addition, only\n\nvery few mouse models of CCC are currently available. Recently\n\nXu and colleagues showed that liver-specific disruption of the\n\nSMAD4 and PTEN genes leads to the formation of CCC (Xu\n\net al., 2006). NF2 knockout mice were shown to develop hepato-\nSignificance\n\nOveractivation of the Notch signaling pathway leads to a dysreg\nCCC.

For example, loss of the Notch ligand jagged1 or the Notch\n\n2 gene results in congenital hypoplasia of the biliary system,\n\ncalled the Alagille syndrome (Geisler et al., 2008; Lorent et al.,\n\n2004; Ryan et al., 2008). Analysis of mice after liver-specific inac-\n\ntivation of RBP-Jk, a common transcriptional mediator of Notch\n\nsignaling, revealed a reduced number of biliary cells differenti-\n\nating from hepatoblasts (Zong et al., 2009). Notch levels are\n\nregulated by ubiquitylation-dependent protein turnover, which\n\nis controlled by the SCFFbw7 E3-ubiquitin ligase (Welcker and\n\nClurman, 2008). The F-Box component of this E3-ligase, the\n\nFbw7 protein, was found to be frequently mutated in human\n\nCCC (Akhoondi et al., 2007). However, it is unknown whether\n\nNotch dysregulation is involved in the initiation and progression\n\nof CCC.\nulation of the oncogene cyclin E, resulting in the formation of\neration and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

Use of this cre-\n\nline results in the expression of NICD in the vast majority of\n\nall hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells during the forma-\n\ntion of the second ductal layer (E16.5) (Zong et al., 2009).\n\nNotchIC::AlbCre mice were born at normal Mendelian ratios,\n\nbut showed proportionally reduced body and liver weights (Fig-\n\nures 1A\u20131C) and up to 25% reduced body size (Figure S1A [age,\n\n7 months] available online) compared to wild-type control litter-\n\nmates.

As shown in Fig-\n\nure S1B, only the liver expressed detectable amounts of GFP,\n\nwhile in all other tested organs the transgene was not activated.\n\nTo ensure expression and activity of the intracellular domain of\n\nNotch in cholangiocytes and hepatocytes, we performed immu-\n\nnostainings on mouse liver tissue from NotchIC::AlbCre mice\n\nand wild-type controls, using antibodies specific for the cleaved\n\nform of Notch. As shown in Figure 1D, NICD expression was\n\ndetected in both cell types in the transgenic animals but not in\n\nwild-type liver controls. In line with a constitutive activation of\n\nNotch signaling, we also detected strong expression of HES1,\n\na transcriptional target of the Notch pathway in Notch IC::AlbCre\n\nlivers (Figure 1D) and in liver lysates (Figure 1E).\n\nGiven the expression of Notch ICD in hepatocytes and the\n\nbiliary compartments of the liver, we first set out to analyze the\n\nfunctional consequences of Notch expression in hepatocytes.\n\nUpon histologic examination of theNotchIC::AlbCre liver tissues,\n\nwe detected a significant increase in the cell size of the NICD-\n\npositive hepatocytes as well as variations in nuclear size in trans-\n\ngenic livers compared to wild-type controls (Figure 2A). Serum\n\ntransaminases and different liver metabolites were also changed\n\nin NotchIC::AlbCre mice compared to wild-type controls (Fig-\n\nure S1C). To measure the size of individual hepatocytes, we\n\nstained liver sections with a specific antibody against beta\n\ncatenin (Kossatz et al., 2004) and quantified the differences\n\nbetween NotchIC::AlbCre and wild-type controls (Figures 2A\n\nand 2B). In accordance with an increase in cell size, we also\n\nnoticed a reduction in the number of hepatocytes per visual field\n\nin the NotchIC::AlbCre compared to wild-type livers (Figure 2C).\n\nBecause an increase in hepatocyte size can be the result of a\n\nchange in the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, we determined\n\nnuclear sizes and DNA content in NotchIC::AlbCre mice and\n\nwild-type control mice. As shown in Figure 2A, the nuclei of\n\nhepatocytes in NotchIC::AlbCre mice are significantly larger\n\nthan those in control mice. To analyze if these changes were\n\nparalleled by an increase in the amount of nuclear DNA, we\n\nperformed Feulgen staining and measured the DNA content of\n\nsingle nuclei by cytometry. As shown in Figure 2D, we found\n\nthat the nuclei of hepatocytes in the NotchIC::AlbCre mice are\n\nnot only enlarged but also contain significantly more DNA than\n\nthe nuclei of nontransgenic control livers. Nuclear enlargement\n\nand an increase in DNA content are often the result of endoredu-\n\nplication cycles in which the cell undergoes continuous rounds of\n\nDNA replication without cytokinesis (Kossatz et al., 2004). To test\n\nwhether the NotchIC::AlbCre livers also display alterations with\n\nregard to cellular proliferation, we performed partial (two-thirds)\n\nhepatectomies in NotchIC::AlbCre transgenic animals and\n\ncompared their regenerative potential with that of wild-type\n\norgans. As shown in Figure 2E, expression of NotchIC::AlbCre\n\nleads to an almost complete loss of regeneration potential in\nsix mice per time point were counted. The average number of HH3-positive cells\n\nNotchIC::AlbCre mice is displayed relative to the number of HH3-positive cells in\n\n(G) Analysis of the expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin E, p27, and actin in liver tiss\n\nindicated mouse strains at the age of 10 weeks.\n\nScale bars represent mean values \u00b1 SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.001.\ntransgenic livers of 10-week-old mice as shown by a reduction\n\nof BrdU uptake after partial hepatectomy and a concomitant\n\nreduction in cells entering mitosis as measured by histone H3\n\nphosphorylation (Figure 2F). This lack of proliferation was\n\naccompanied by a significant increase in hepatocyte cell size\n\nand a reduction in cell number after partial hepatectomy, thereby\n\nindicating that the NotchIC::AlbCre mice regenerated their liver\n\nmass through cellular hypertrophy of the remaining hepatocytes\n\n(Figure S1D). At themolecular level we found that wild-type livers\n\ndownregulate the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27kip1 and started to\n\nexpress S phase cyclins E and A after induction of cell cycle pro-\n\ngression by partial hepatectomy (Figure 2G). Importantly and in\n\ncontrast to wild-type livers, we detected elevated levels of cyclin\n\nE and cyclin A even before partial hepatectomies were per-\n\nformed in NotchIC::AlbCre expressing livers. Together these\n\nresults suggest that the expression of the intracellular domain\n\nof Notch in hepatocytes results in the induction of endoredupli-\n\ncation cycles and a severe impairment of cellular proliferation.\n\nExpression of Notch ICD in Mouse Livers Leads to the\nFormation of Progenitor Cell Derived Cholangiocellular\nCarcinomas\nTo understand the long-term consequences of NICD overex-\n\npression, we followed a cohort of mice for up to 15 months. In\n\n7-month-old mouse livers, we observed areas with clusters of\n\nsmall cells with an epithelial appearance (Figure 3A) that also\n\nformed gland-like structures. To determine the origin of these\n\ncells, we stained liver sections with antibodies specific for the\n\nbiliary tract (CK7, CK17, and CK19), hepatocytic markers\n\n(CK8/18), and the stem cell marker CD34. As shown in Figure 3A,\n\nthe small epithelial cells stained positive for biliary-hepatocytic\n\nas well as stem cell markers, a finding which is typical for cells\n\nthat show characteristics of hepatocytic and cholangiocytic dif-\n\nferentiation. Such cells often arise through the transformation of\n\nbipotential hepatic progenitor cells (Kim et al., 2004), which are\n\nlocated in the canals of Hering.\n\nImportantly, as early as 8 months after birth we started to\n\nobserve changes in nuclear morphology in primary liver tissues\n\nfrom NotchIC::AlbCre mice. To test whether the observed cells\n\nwere indeed tumor cells, we transplanted primary tissue from\n\nNotchIC::AlbCre mouse livers subcutaneously on the flanks of\n\nimmunodeficient mice. All implantations resulted in the formation\n\nof tumors. Figure 3B shows the growth curve of the subcutane-\n\nous tumors that arose after cell transplantation. Histopathologic\n\nanalysis revealed that these tumors show many features of\n\nhuman CCCs (Figure 3C), including the expression of CK7 and\n\nCK17 and a typical desmoid reaction of the surrounding tissue.\n\nLiver tissue from Alb-Cre mice was used as a control and did\n\nnot give rise to tumors (Figure S2G). These results suggested\n\nthat intrahepatic expression of NICD in hepatic progenitor cells\n\ncan induce differentiation of these cells toward the biliary lineage\n\nand that, over time, NICD expression induces malignant trans-\n\nformation of these cells.

Vector-infected cells\n\nserved as controls. Figure S2A shows the expression levels of\n\nNICD in such cells compared to empty vector-infected cells.\n\nCells stably expressing NICD were subcutaneously injected\n\ninto nude mice and tumor growth was analyzed over time. While\n\ncontrol vector-transduced cells did not give rise to tumors,\n\nNICD-overexpressing cells formed subcutaneous tumors (Fig-\n\nure 3D) in all transplantation experiments. These tumors\n\nshowed all features of CCCs (Figure 3E). Interestingly, tumors\n\narising from progenitor cells stably transduced with c-Myc and\n\na constitutive active form of Akt showed a different histopathol-\n\nogy and were classified as undifferentiated hepatocellular carci-\n\nnomas/hepatoblastomas (Figure 3E). These results indicate that\n\nexpression of the intracellular domain of Notch leads to tumor\n\nformation in all transgenic mice and can transform hepatic pro-\n\ngenitor cells thereby leading to the development of CCCs.\n\nNotch Signaling Leads to Dysregulated Expression\nof Cyclin E and Genetic Instability\nTo understand the molecular pathogenesis of Notch-dependent\n\nCCC formation, we focused our analysis on the function of the\n\ncyclin E protein. As shown in Figure 2G, cyclin E is highly ex-\n\npressed in NotchIC::AlbCre-derived liver tissue even before the\n\nonset of liver regeneration (time point 0). In line with this finding,\n\nwe detected high levels of cyclin E protein within the CCCs\n\nderived from NotchIC::AlbCremice (Figure 4A). Previous studies\n\non the oncogenic function of cyclin E suggested that cyclin E in-\n\nduces DNA damage, thus resulting in genetic instability and\n\ncontributing to the formation of malignant tumors (Spruck\n\net al., 1999). We therefore tested if cyclin E-overexpressing chol-\n\nangiocellular tumors might show signs of DNA damage by stain-\n\ning primary mouse CCC tissues derived from NotchIC::AlbCre\n\nmice with antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of\n\nSer-139 of histone H2AX (gH2AX), a marker for DNA double-\n\nstrand breaks. As shown in Figure 4B, we found that more\n\nthan 70% of all cells in these CCCs show signs of DNA damage\n\nas compared to wild-type liver tissue. Similarly, tumor tissues\n\nderived from nude mice transplanted with primary tumor cells\n\nfromNotchIC::AlbCre also showed high levels of cyclin E expres-\n\nsion and stained positive for gH2AX (Figure 4C). Mice expressing\n\nonly cre-recombinase do not show any signs of genetic insta-\n\nbility as measured by gH2AX staining (Kossatz et al., 2010).\n\nWe then determined whether a reduction in cyclin E expression\n\nwould reduce the number of gH2AX-positive cells. Figure 4D\n\nshows that transfection of human MzChA1 cholangiocarcinoma\n\ncells with siRNAs against cyclins E1 and E2 (Figure S2B) led to a\n\nsignificant reduction in the number of gH2AX-positive cells.\n\nBased on these results, we speculated that Notch signaling\n\nmight be directly involved in the regulation of the cyclin E pro-\n\nmoter and thus in the induction of genetic instability and CCC\n\ninitiation and progression. Interestingly, the cyclin E1 promoter\n\ncontains several Rbpjk binding sites that could be involved in\n\nthe regulation of the promoter by NICD signaling. We used a pre-\n\nviously described cyclin E1 promoter luciferase reporter\n\nconstruct (Geng et al., 1996) to measure promoter activity in\n\nthe CCC cell with or without NICD overexpression. To determine\n\nthe activity of the cyclin E gene, we transfected the CycE-Luc\npromoter construct into CCC cells (MzChA1, TFK1) and\n\nmeasured luciferase expression in these cells as compared to\n\nthat in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Hep3B, HepG2). As\n\nshown in Figure 4E, we found higher basal levels of cyclin E pro-\n\nmoter activity in the CCC cell lines as compared to levels in liver\n\ncancer cells (Hep3B) or hepatoblastoma cells (HepG2). Next, we\n\ndetermined whether NICD was able to induce the activation of\n\nthe cyclin E promoter. Cotransfection of NICD with the CycE-\n\nLuc reporter construct resulted in a more than 10-fold induction\n\nof the cyclin E promoter (Figure 4E). Moreover, cotransfection of\n\nNICD with an expression plasmid for the dominant-negative\n\nco-activator Mastermind prevented the activation of the cyclin\n\nE promoter by NICD, indicating that the activation of the cyclin\n\nE promoter was a direct consequence of NICD activity.\n\nGiven the importance of cyclin E expression for the generation\n\nof genetically unstable CCC cells, we next tested whether the\n\ninduction of cyclin E is required for the observed oncogenic\n\ntransformation of bipotential hepatic progenitors. For this\n\npurpose, we transduced NICD-expressing liver progenitor cells\n\nwith retroviruses for stable expression of two different shRNAs\n\nagainst cyclin E. After selection, we measured the knockdown\n\nlevel of cyclin E in these cell populations (Figures S2C and S2D)\n\nand transplanted these cells subcutaneously into immunodefi-\n\ncient mice. As shown in Figure 3D, compared to ICN-expressing\n\ncells that were transduced with control shRNAs, there was a\n\nstrong inhibition of tumor development from cells with stable\n\nexpression of cyclin E shRNAs together with ICN. Overall, only\n\none mice developed tumors (mouse 1a,1b). Western blot anal-\n\nysis of the tumor tissue showedprofound cyclin E protein expres-\n\nsion (Figure S2E), indicating a selection against RNAi-mediated\n\ncyclin E knockdown in these particular tumors. Our results sug-\n\ngest that expression of NICD results in the activation of the cyclin\n\nE promoter and increased cyclin E expressionwhich, through the\n\ninduction of genetic instability, leads to the formation of CCCs.\n\nNotch 1 and 3 Are Overexpressed in Human\nCholangiocellular Carcinoma\nPrompted by these results, we next tested whether the Notch\n\npathway is also active in human CCC cells and tissues. We first\n\ndetermined the expression and activity of the Notch signaling\n\npathway in three established human CCC cell lines (TFK1,\n\nMzChA1, and EgI1) and also in a primary cell line that we derived\n\nfrom a CCC tumor specimen (SZ1). As shown in Figure 5A, all\n\nCCC cell lines expressed the Notch1 receptor as well as the\n\nNotch ligand jagged while hepatocellular or colon carcinoma\n\ncell lines did not show an activation of this pathway (Figure S2F).\n\nTo determine whether the Notch signaling pathway is active in\n\nCCC cells, we used an antibody that recognizes the cleaved\n\nform of Notch 1 (Notch val 1744) and the downstream target\n\ngene Hes1. As shown in Figure 5A, all CCC cell lines expressed\n\nthe activated form of the Notch receptor and the HES1 protein,\n\nindicating that the Notch signaling pathway is active in these\n\ntumor cells but not in HeLa cells, which we used as a control.\n\nTo ensure that the NICD transgenic mouse line is an adequate\n\nmodel system, we compared the expression levels of NICD in\n\nthe CCCs that arose in our transgenic animals to the levels ex-\n\npressed in the human CCC cell lines. As shown in Figure 5B,\n\nmouse tissue and human CCC lines express comparable levels\n\nof cleaved Notch and HES1 protein. Finally, we tested whether\nCancer Cell 23, 784\u2013795, June 10, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc. 789\n\n\n\n** \n\nH\n2A\n\nX\n fo\n\nci\n p\n\ner\n n\n\nuc\nle\n\nus\n\n10 \n\n40 \n\n30 \n\n20 \n\n50 \n\nM\nzC\n\nhA\n1 \n\nsiRNA \n\ncy\ncl\n\nin\n E\n\n1 \n\ncy\ncl\n\nin\n E\n\n1+\nE\n\n2 \n\nw\nt h\n\nep\nat\n\noc\nyt\n\nes\n \n\ncy\ncl\n\nin\n E\n\n2 \n\n * \n\n** \n\nre\nl. \n\nlu\nci\n\nfe\nra\n\nse\n a\n\nct\niv\n\nity\n  \n\n 4 \n\n16 \n\n12 \n\n 8 \n\n20 \n\n   \n  H\n\nep\n3B\n\n \n\nne\ng.\n\n c\non\n\ntr\nol\n\n \n\npo\ns.\n\n c\non\n\ntr\nol\n\n \n\nMzChA1 \n\n+ \nN\n\nIC\nD\n\n \n\n   \n  H\n\nep\nG\n\n2 \n\nT\nF\n\nK\n1 \n\n+ \ndo\n\nm\n.n\n\neg\n.

Using the Kendall tau-b rank test, we found that\n\ncyclin E1 and Notch 1 showed a highly significant (p < 0.001)\n\nco-expression in the CCC tissues tested. These results suggest\n\nthat overexpression of Notch promotes the expression of the\n\ncyclin E gene through activation of the cyclin E promoter, which\n\nresults in the formation of DNA double-strand breaks in human\n\nCCC cells.\n\nNotch Signaling as a Therapeutic Target in CCC\nOur analysis of primary CCC tissues and the observation that\n\nNICD transgenic mice develop CCCs point toward a central\n\nrole of the Notch signaling pathway in the formation of these\n\ntumors. To test whether the expression of Notch was also\n\nrequired for CCC maintenance, we transfected the cells with\n\nsiRNAs specific for Notch 1. As shown in Figure 6A, loss of Notch\n\n1 expression led to a reduction in HES1 and cyclin E expression\n\nwhile p53, p27, and p21were strongly induced. Forty-eight hours\nCancer Cell 23, 784\u20137\nafter the transfection of Notch 1 siRNA,\n\napproximately 50% of all MzChA1 cells\n\nhad undergone apoptosis (Figure 6B).\n\nCombined ablation of Notch 1 and 3 by\n\nsiRNA led to an even more pronounced\n\neffect, indicating that signaling through\n\nboth receptors is required for CCC main-\n\ntenance (Figures S4A and S4B).\n\nNotch signaling depends on g-secre-\n\ntase-mediated generation of NICD, which\n\ntranslocates to the nucleus to induce a\n\ncell type-specific transcriptional pro-\n\ngram. To test whether g-secretase inhibi-\n\ntion of Notch signaling might constitute a\n\ntreatment option against CCC,we treated\nthese cells with the g-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluoro-\n\nphenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT). As\n\nshown in Figure 6C, DAPT treatment resulted in a time-depen-\n\ndent decrease in the expression of the cleaved form of the Notch\n\nreceptor and theNotch target geneHes1. Similar resultswere ob-\n\ntained with other CCC cell lines (Figure S4C). In line with our\n\nobservation that Notch controls cyclin E transcription, DAPT\n\ntreatment also led to adecrease in cyclin Eexpression inMzChA1\n\ncells as determined by RT-PCR (Figure S4D). To determine the\n\nfunctional consequences of Notch inhibition, we determined\n\nthe number of apoptotic MzChA1 cells after treatment with\n\nDAPT. As shown in Figure 6D, DAPT treatment of MzChA1 cells\n\nresulted in a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells\n\nasmeasuredby the activation of caspases 3and7. This decrease\n\nin viability was accompanied by a significant reduction of BrdU\n\nuptake (FigureS4E) and a strong increase in the expression levels\n\nof the cyclin kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 as well as the tumor\n\nsuppressor protein p53 (Figure S4F). Similar results were found\n\nin the other CCC lines (EGI-1, TFK-1) (data not shown).\n\nFinally, we tested whether inhibition of Notch signaling would\n\nalso affect the growth of xenotransplanted human CCCs.

Cells derived from cell line\n\nSZ1 were mixed with Matrigel and injected subcutaneously\n\ninto immunodeficient mice. When the tumors reached a size of\n\napproximately 150\u2013200 mm3, mice were treated with DAPT at\n\na concentration of 50 mg/kg every 72 hr. As shown in Figure 6E\n\nand Figure S4G, inhibition of g-secretase resulted in a significant\n\ninhibition of tumor growth as compared to untreated controls.\n\nThis inhibition of tumor growth was accompanied by the induc-\n\ntion of p21, p27, and p53 and a downregulation of cyclin E\n\nexpression in the primary tumor tissues (Figure 6F). Histologic\n\nexamination of these tumors revealed, in accordance with the\n\nresults we had obtained using CCC cell lines, that treatment\n\nwith DAPT resulted in the induction of apoptosis in the xeno-\n\ntransplanted tumors as shown by TUNEL staining of the primary\n\ntissues (Figure S4H).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe pathogenesis of CCC is only incompletely understood. A\n\nnumber of genetic and epigenetic changes as well as alterations\n792 Cancer Cell 23, 784\u2013795, June 10, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc.\nin growth factor signaling have been\n\ndescribed. Nevertheless, treatment op-\n\ntions are still sparse and given the lack of\n\na detailed understanding of the underlying\n\npathogenesis, targeted therapies are diffi-\n\ncult to implement. In this study, we used a\n\ntransgenic mouse line that expresses the\n\nintracellular domain of the Notch 1 recep-\n\ntor in liver cells starting at day 9.5.\nOur phenotypic andmolecular analysis of theNotchIC::AlbCre\n\nmice revealed opposite roles for Notch signaling in the hepatic\n\nand cholangiocytic compartments. We found that NICD-overex-\n\npressing hepatocytes undergo endoreduplication cycles that\n\nresult in the formation of polyploid liver cells. This defect in\n\nmitotic cell division is also apparent in liver regeneration experi-\n\nments that show that NICD-expressing hepatocytes fail to re-\n\nenter the cell cycle after a partial hepatectomy. In line with our\n\nfindings Croquelois and colleagues showed that loss of Notch\n\n1 in hepatocytes led to the overproliferation of hepatocytes,\n\nwhich caused the formation of regenerative nodules (Croquelois\n\net al., 2005). Together, these results suggest that Notch signaling\n\nin hepatocytes is primarily antiproliferative and prevents uncon-\n\ntrolled proliferation of liver cells.\n\nWe found that overexpression of NICD results in the formation\n\nof CCCs, implicating this signaling pathway in the pathogenesis\n\nof this tumor. Zong and colleagues convincingly showed that\n\nectopic Notch expression led to the formation of biliary epithelial\n\ncells in the hepatic lobule (Zong et al., 2009). Moreover, expres-\n\nsion of Notch in livers of 6-day-old mice led to the formation of\n\nectopic biliary structures within the liver. Their experiments\n\n\n\nCancer Cell\n\nNotch Induces Cholangiocellular Carcinoma\ntherefore argue for the ability of Notch signaling to induce a fate\n\ndecision in hepatoblasts or even terminally differentiated hepa-\n\ntocytes that allows them to differentiate toward the biliary\n\nlineage. The ability of hepatocytes to change their fate decision\n\nunder the influence of AKT and Notch signaling or under condi-\n\ntions of chemically induced carcinogenesis has been shown\n\nrecently (Fan et al., 2012; Sekiya and Suzuki, 2012). These\n\nstudies provided evidence that hepatocytes localized around\n\nthe central vein can be transformed into biliary cancers. While\n\na growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that human\n\nCCC is derived from intrahepatic stem cell compartments\n\n(Cardinale et al., 2012; Nakanuma et al., 2010), it needs to be\n\nshownwhether a change in cellular differentiation can contribute\n\nto human CCC pathogenesis. Recent data in other systems indi-\n\ncate that Notch signaling drives intestinal cell fate determination\n\nof progenitor cells, for example, those lining the intestinal crypts,\n\nand blockade of Notch signaling via gamma secretase inhibition\n\nforces intestinal progenitor cells to differentiate into goblet cells\n\n(van Es et al., 2005; Zecchini et al., 2005). This pathologic profile\n\nis reminiscent of that seen inHes-1 deficientmice, a downstream\n\nNotch target gene (Kodama et al., 2004). Our analysis showed\n\nthat expression of NICD in mouse liver cells results in the forma-\n\ntion of CCCs, which in addition to cholangiocytic features, also\n\nexpress surface markers associated with stem cells thereby\n\nindicating that NICD expression in undifferentiated liver progen-\n\nitor cells might have transformed those cells into tumor cells. It is\n\nnot known how the expression of Notch ICD in differentiated\n\ncholangiocytes may also result in the formation of cancers.\n\nThe finding that NICD expression in hepatic progenitors\n\nresults in the formation of CCCs was further substantiated by\n\nthe fact that cells isolated from these primary tumors led to the\n\nformation of CCC after transplantation into nude mice. Given\n\nthe high plasticity of these cells, we cannot exclude that Notch\n\nsignaling might lead to the formation of tumors that resemble\n\nfeatures of hepatocellular carcinoma or even mixed phenotypes\n\n(Villanueva et al., 2012). We therefore set out to directly prove\n\nthat aberrant Notch signaling in bipotential liver progenitor cells\n\ncauses the formation of CCC. To this end, we created progenitor\n\ncell lines that stably express NICD and found that these cells did\n\nindeed start to form tumors that show all characteristics of CCCs\n\nafter transplantation into mice. These tumors also showed\n\nelevated levels of cyclin E expression and a high degree of\n\ngenetic instability. We therefore concluded that liver progenitor\n\ncells can act as the cells of origin in the formation of CCCs in\n\nresponse to Notch signaling.\n\nA central question that arose out of these findings is how the\n\nexpression of NICD can lead to the formation of CCC. In this\n\nwork, we found that cyclin E protein levels are greatly increased\n\nnot only in CCCs derived from NotchIC::AlbCre mice, but also\n\nin primary human CCC tissues. Several mouse models have\n\ndemonstrated that deregulated cyclin E expression is causally\n\nassociated with tumorigenesis in vivo. Overexpression of human\n\ncyclin E in mammary or thymic tissues, or prevention of cyclin E\n\ndegradation throughmutation of the T380 phosphorylation site in\n\nmouse cyclin E, resulted in the formation of tumors (Hwang and\n\nClurman, 2005; Loeb et al., 2005). The oncogenic function of\n\ncyclin E is coupled to its ability to induce double-strand breaks\n\nthat ultimately result in the formation of genetically unstable\n\ncells. Using gH2AX as a marker for double-strand breaks, we\nshowed that the tumors derived from NotchIC::AlbCre mice as\n\nwell as tumors derived from NICD-expressing bipotential pro-\n\ngenitors show high levels of DNA double-strand breaks and\n\nthat reduction of cyclin E expression ameliorates this phenotype.\n\nInterestingly the dysregulation of cyclin E expression is caused\n\nby an increased transcription of the cyclin E promoter in\n\nresponse to NICD expression a finding that defines cyclin E as\n\na direct transcriptional target of the Notch signaling pathway.\n\nGiven that suppression of cyclin E expression by shRNA treat-\n\nment results in a complete suppression of tumor formation in\n\nNICD-expressing liver progenitors, we conclude that cyclin E is\n\nindeed a critical downstream effector of Notch signaling-\n\ninduced tumor formation.\n\nOur observations together with the data provided by Zong and\n\nStanger therefore suggest that Notch signaling can induce a\n\nbiliary differentiation program in hepatocytes or hepatic progen-\n\nitor cells, which together with the aberrant expression of the\n\ncyclin E protein results in the formation of intrahepatic CCCs. It\n\nis currently unknown why the Notch 1 and 3 receptors are upre-\n\ngulated in CCC cells. T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast\n\ncancer, and other tumors or cell lines derived from such cancers\n\nshow genetic alterations that affect the expression of different\n\ncomponents of the Notch signaling pathway (Koch and Radtke,\n\n2007).\n\nRecently, Fbw7, the F-Box protein that controls the turnover of\n\nNotch 1 as part of a SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase, was shown to be\n\nmutated in up to 35% of all CCCs examined (Akhoondi et al.,\n\n2007). This result points to a defect in Notch turnover that might\n\ncontribute to the increase in protein levels. Interestingly the\n\nSCFFbw7 complex also ubiquitylates the cyclin E1 and E2 pro-\n\nteins and loss or mutation of the Fbw7 protein results in\n\nincreased cyclin E expression (Koepp et al., 2001; Welcker\n\net al., 2003). We have shown that overexpression of the Notch\n\nICD in mouse livers leads to an increase in cyclin E expression\n\nand that Notch ICD can directly transactivate the cyclin E1 pro-\n\nmoter. Loss of Fbw7 might therefore cause an increase in cyclin\n\nE levels not only through a reduction of cyclin E ubiquitylation\n\nand turnover, but also through an increased transcription of\n\nthe Cyclin E gene through the Notch signaling pathway.\n\nCCCs frequently arise under conditions of chronic inflamma-\n\ntion. The interleukin-6 (IL-6)/gp130 signaling system constitutes\n\nan important component of the inflammatory response in the\n\nliver and was shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of\n\nCCCs. This aberrant overexpression of IL-6 is a consequence\n\nof the epigenetic silencing of the suppressor of cytokine\n\nsignaling 3 (SOCS-3) (Isomoto et al., 2007). Intriguingly IL-6 is\n\nable to induce a Notch-3\u2013dependent transcriptional activation\n\nof the jagged gene in breast cancer cells (Sansone et al.,\n\n2007). Dysregulation of Notch signaling might therefore be a\n\nresult of alterations in its proteolytic turnover and exogenous\n\nfactors like the stimulation of jagged transcription by IL-6. While\n\nthis hypothesis awaits experimental proof, our experiments\n\nusing isolated NICD-expressing progenitors show that transfor-\n\nmation of these cells does not require additional inflammation.\n\nTo date, no specific treatment exists for patients with CCCs\n\nthat are not eligible for surgery. We therefore set out to test\n\nwhether inhibition of Notch signaling would interfere with the\n\nproliferation and survival of CCC cells. Loss of Notch signaling\n\neither by inhibition of g-secretase or by suppressing Notch\nCancer Cell 23, 784\u2013795, June 10, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc. 793\n\n\n\nCancer Cell\n\nNotch Induces Cholangiocellular Carcinoma\nactivity through siRNA-mediated ablation of Notch 1 and 3\n\nexpression resulted in the induction of cell cycle arrest and\n\napoptosis. Notch inhibition also led to the regression of estab-\n\nlished xenotransplant tumors derived from CCC cell lines in vivo.\n\nInhibition of g-secretase activity might therefore constitute a\n\nmolecular target that interferes with the dysregulated expression\n\nof cyclin E.\n\nIn this study we found that NotchIC::AlbCre mice not only\n\nformed ectopic biliary structures, but also intrahepatic CCCs.\n\nTogether with the observation that Notch can induce a biliary\n\ncell fate in bipotential progenitors lead to the idea that the path-\n\nogenesis of intrahepatic CCCs might differ significantly from the\n\nformation of biliary tumors that arise primarily from the bile ducts\n\n(i.e., Klatskin carcinoma). Our data suggest that intrahepatic\n\nCCC might constitute a tumor that forms as a result of aberrant\n\nNotch signaling in hepatic progenitors that transform into tumor\n\ncells. Moreover we show that inhibition of Notch signaling consti-\n\ntutes an attractive target for future clinical trials in patients with\n\nintrahepatic CCCs.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\nAnimals and Partial Hepatectomy Procedures\n\nROSA26 NICD mice (Murtaugh et al., 2003) were crossed with AlbCre mice\n\n(Kellendonk et al., 2000) to generate mice with a liver-specific overexpression\n\nof the activated form of the Notch 1 receptor. All genotyping was performed as\n\ndescribed (Murtaugh et al., 2003). In all experiments, 8- to 10-week-old wild-\n\ntype and double transgenic littermates were used. Mice were killed at the\n\nindicated time points after surgery, and the number of mice analyzed ranged\n\nfrom five to six per time point. Partial hepatectomy was performed as\n\ndescribed (Satyanarayana et al., 2003). All animal experiments were per-\n\nformed after review and approval by the Niedersa\u0308chsische Landesamt fu\u0308r\n\nVerbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit, Lower Saxony, Germany.\n\nImmunohistochemical Staining of Mouse and Human Tissues\n\nImmunohistochemical staining of mouse and human tissue was performed as\n\ndescribed previously (Kossatz et al., 2004). Surgical specimens were taken for\n\ndiagnostic and scientific purposes permitted by the Ethics Committee of the\n\nUniversity of Bern, Switzerland. Informed consent was obtained from all\n\npatients.\n\nFeulgen Staining\n\nTo determine the DNA content, 3 mm sections were Feulgen-stained using the\n\nFeulgen Staining Kit (Merck). Ploidy analysis was performed with the Ahrens\n\nICM, Cytometric System. Statistical analysis was done using the Dunnett\n\nt test (DNA ploidy) and the mixed models analysis of variance (nuclear size\n\nanalysis).\n\nRT-PCR\n\nRNA extraction was done as described (Satyanarayana et al., 2003). For cDNA\n\nsynthesis, 2 mg of RNA were used. The RT reaction was carried out using\n\nSuperScript-II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For semiquantitive\n\nRT-PCR, 1 ml cDNA was amplified using the following cycles: denaturation\n\n94\ufffdC for 30 s, annealing 57\ufffdC for 1 min, and extension 72\ufffdC for 45 s using\nRedTaq (Sigma) for 35 cycles. Actin was used as a control.\n\nsiRNA\n\nsiRNA knockdownwas performed using FuGene6 transfection reagent. Trans-\n\nfectionswere performed using siRNA at a concentration of 20 nM for Notch 1 si\n\nRNA; sc-36095 and Notch 3 siRNA; sc-37135 from Santa Cruz. siRNA in a\n\nconcentration of 40 nM was used for cyclin E1 and cyclin E2 knockdown.\n\nDAPT Treatment In Vitro\n\nFive milligrams of DAPT were dissolved in 1 ml dimethyl sulfoxide. Cells were\n\nplated in six-well plates. When the cells reached 60% confluency, they were\n794 Cancer Cell 23, 784\u2013795, June 10, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc.\ntreated with 38.7 mM DAPT. Cells were collected after 12, 24, 36, and 48 hr\n\nfor protein extraction and analyzed by western blot.\n\nWestern Blot\n\nAntibodies included cleaved Notch 1 (Val1744, Cell signaling); Hes-1 (Santa\n\nCruz Biotechnology); Notch 1: C-20; sc 6014 (Santa Cruz), Notch 3: (M-134);\n\nsc5593 (Santa Cruz); Jagged 1:C-20, sc-6011 (Santa Cruz); p27: Cat 610242\n\n(BD Transduction), p21 C-19; sc397 (Santa Cruz), p53 FL-393, sc6243 (Santa\n\nCruz); and cyclin E: C19 (Delta Biolabs). Western blots were performed as\n\ndescribed (Malek et al., 2001).\n\nGeneration of Immortalized Bipotential Liver Progenitor Cells,\n\nRetroviral Transduction, and Subcutaneous Injection of Cells\n\nBipotential liver progenitor cells were isolated from C57Bl6 embryonic mouse\n\nlivers as described recently (Zender et al., 2006). For additional information,\n\nplease refer to the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel software. Unless\n\nstated otherwise, all data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD; error bars represent\n\nSD in all figures. Intergroup comparisons were performed by two-tailed\n\nStudent\u2019s t test. A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\nCaspase 3/7 Assay and TUNEL Staining\n\nFor detection of apoptosis, we used theCaspase-Glo 3/7 Assay fromPromega\n\nthat measures caspase-3 and -7 activities because these members of the\n\ncaspase family play important roles in apoptosis in mammalian cells. Themea-\n\nsurements were done as described in the manufacturer manual. We used the\n\nIn Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\n\nmanual for TUNEL staining.\n\nLuciferase Assay\n\nMzChA1 cells were transiently transfected with a cyclin E promotor luciferase\n\nreporter construct, a NICD expression construct, and phRL-TK (Promega) for\n\nnormalization using FUGENE. After 48 hr, luciferase activity was measured\n\nusing the \u2018\u2018dual-luciferase reporter assay system\u2019\u2019 (Promega) following the\n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, cells were lysed in 13 passive lysis buffer;\n\nafter 10 min, cells were scraped off the dishes and incubated for 5 min on ice.\n\nAfter centrifugation, 20 ml of cleared lysateswere used for analysis of luciferase\n\nactivity. The 96-well plate reader \u2018\u2018Glomax-integrated luciferase technologies\u2019\u2019\n\n(TURNER Biosystems) was used to quantify luciferase activity. Firefly lucif-\n\nerase activity was normalized to cotransfected Renilla luciferase activity\n\n(phRLTK).\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n\nSupplemental Information includes four figures, one table, and Supplemental\n\nExperimental Procedures and can be found with this article online at http://dx.\n\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2013.04.019.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Dr. Holly Sundberg Malek for critical advice.
