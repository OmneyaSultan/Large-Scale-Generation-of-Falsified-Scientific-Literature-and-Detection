F\na b s t r a c t\n\nInflammatory responses of THP-1 cells (macrophage cell line) exposed to chrysotile asbestos (Chry) and\nLibby six-mix (LIB) and the subsequent impact on bronchial epithelial cells were determined. Direct\ntreatment of THP-1 cells with Chry caused cell death, activation of caspase-1 and release of IL-1b, while\nthe addition of caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK, reduced IL-1b, suggesting that Chry activated the cas-\npase-1 mediated Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome; by comparison, LIB had less effects\non all of these parameters. Expression of antioxidant enzymes, protein oxidation and nitration, and lipid\nperoxides in THP-1 cells treated with the two particles suggest that LIB generated more reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) than the same dose of Chry. Differences in fiber length and surface area suggest a possible\nrole for particulate size in the differential activation of the inflammasome. BEAS-2B cells, representing the\nbronchial epithelium, treated with supernatants of medium from Chry- or LIB-treated THP-1 cells (con-\nditioned medium) activated the MAPK cascade, increased phosphorylation of ERK and Cot (MAP3K8),\nincreased AP-1 binding activity and induced IL-6 release. To verify that IL-1b from THP-1 cells was\nresponsible for activation of BEAS-2B, conditioned medium with added IL-1Ra, an IL-1b antagonist,\nwas applied to BEAS-2B. Results show that IL-1Ra attenuated effects of conditioned medium, supporting\na role of IL-1b, as a secondary mediator, in the transduction of inflammatory signaling from the macro-\nphage to epithelial cells. The effects of LIB-conditioned medium appeared to be less dependent on IL-1b.\nIn conclusion, Chry and LIB induce differential inflammatory responses in THP-1 cells that subsequently\nlead to differential effects in epithelial cells.\n\n\ufffd 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Inflammation plays a key role in lung injury, involving\ndifferent cell types, such as alveolar macrophages and bronchial\nepithelial cells that initiate and/or sustain inflammatory processes.\nAlveolar macrophages provide surveillance of the major bound-\naries between the body and the outside world. Macrophages are in-\nnate immune cells with well-established roles in the primary\nresponse to pathogens. These cells recognize danger signals\nthrough receptors and activate specific signaling pathways [2].\nThe macrophage-like cell line, THP-1, has been shown to secrete\nthe proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1b, upon contact with crocidolite\nasbestos [3\u20135]. Mature IL-1b is processed through cleavage of the\ninactive pro-IL-1b precursor by caspase-1/ICE (IL-1b converting en-\nzyme). Caspase-1 was the first caspase to be discovered in mam-\nmals, but only recently has the pathway leading to its activation\nbeen elucidated and shown to involve a series of large complexes,\ncalled inflammasomes [6,7]. Stimulation of macrophages with\nasbestos resulted in cell death and robust secretion of IL-1b in a\nmanner dependent on the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3),\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.08.025\nmailto:Naomi.Fukagawa@uvm.edu\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.08.025\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine\n\n\nM. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 719\nalso called Nalp3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing pro-\ntein 3) inflammasome [3,4,8,9]. Previous reports have indicated\nthat macrophages from wild-type mice could undergo caspase-1-\nmediated IL-1b maturation but macrophages deficient in the\nNLRP3 inflammasome were incapable of secreting IL-1b [3,4,8].\n\nFollowing the initiation of proinflammatory responses upon\nexposure to asbestos with the release of cytokines, such as IL-1b,\nalveolar macrophages often die and are cleared from the airway.\nIn contrast, neighboring bronchial epithelial cells can sustain path-\nogenic responses and lead to asbestos-related lung disease, even if\nthey may not be in direct contact with the asbestos fibers. IL-6 is\nconsidered to be an important mediator of acute inflammation\n[10] and implicated in the pathogenesis of particle-related lung\ndisease. The MAPK pathways contribute to epithelial cell prolifera-\ntion, which is a major risk factor for the development of lung can-\ncer or fibro-proliferative diseases [11,12]. Whether IL-1b secreted\nby THP-1 cells affects the alveolar epithelium leading to cell prolif-\neration, inflammation and eventual fibrosis via MAPK-IL-6 path-\nways is uncertain although it is well established that direct\nexposure of pulmonary epithelial cells [13], alveolar [14], and\nbronchial epithelial cells [15,16] to asbestos leads to activation of\nMAPK cascades and induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation.\n\nSeveral investigators have examined the interaction between\nmacrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, employing a co-culture\nsystem (Transwell) in which two different cell types were sepa-\nrated by a membrane with only macrophages exposed to the par-\nticles of asbestos or silica [17\u201319]. In the other compartment, the\nepithelial cells were bathed by the same culture medium. Although\ninteresting connections were suggested, the underlying mecha-\nnisms whereby primary responses of the macrophage initiated\nand interacted with lung epithelial cells remain unclear. We have\ninvestigated signal transduction from THP-1 macrophage-like cells\nto BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells through a relatively simple\nmethod: that is, to initially determine the inflammatory responses\nof THP-1 exposed to different particulate fibers followed by collec-\ntion of the supernatants of culture medium without any fibers\n(termed as conditioned medium) in which BEAS-2B cells were then\ngrown and their responses assessed.\n\nAsbestos occurs naturally and is composed of long thin fibers\nbroadly classified into two groups: serpentine and amphibole\n[20]. Chrysotile asbestos (the asbestiform variety of the serpentine\ngroup) is the most commonly used asbestos type in the US [21]. The\namphibole asbestos group consists of five mineral species: amosite,\ncrocidolite, tremolite, actinolite, and anthophyllite. The amphibole\nasbestos occurring in the vermiculite mine near Libby, Montana, is\na mixture of several different species of amphiboles [22]. Several\nresearch groups have studied this material, but the samples used\nin the present work are a subset of those discussed in the publica-\ntion by Meeker et al. [23] and morphologically characterized by\nBellamy and Gunter [24]. Bellamy and Gunter referred to the Libby\nmaterial as \u2018\u2018six-mix\u2019\u2019. Because many of the studies examining the\npathogenic mechanisms related to aberrant cellular responses to\nasbestos exposure utilized different forms of asbestos, the present\nwork contrasts the signal transduction pathways induced by chrys-\notile asbestos (Chry) and Libby six-mix (LIB). The role of IL-1b in the\nTHP-1-conditioned medium secreted in response to Chry or LIB\nwas compared and its subsequent effects on BEAS-2B immune re-\nsponses, specifically IL-6 secretion, were examined.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cell culture\n\nTHP-1 cells: THP-1 cells from a human monocyte cell line were\ngrown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS;\n100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin; 10 mM HEPES and 1 mM So-\ndium pyruvate at 37.0 \ufffdC in 5% CO2. Cells from this monocytic cell\nline require differentiation into cells with the functional character-\nistics of mature macrophages [25,26], accomplished by treatment\nwith 100 nM PMA overnight and then refreshing the cells with\nmedium without PMA. BEAS-2B cells: BEAS-2B cells from the hu-\nman bronchial epithelial cell line (ATCC) were seeded into flasks\nor plates pre-coated with a mixture of 0.01 mg/ml fibronectin,\n0.03 mg/ml bovine collagen type I and 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum\nalbumin in medium. The cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium\n(Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS; 100 U/ml of Penicillin/Streptomy-\ncin, 1 lg/ml Insulin-Transferrin-Na selenite (Sigma), 1 lg/ml\nHydrocortisone (Sigma), and 10 mM HEPES at 37.0 \ufffdC in 5% CO2.\n\n2.2. Chrysotile asbestos and Libby six-mix treatments\n\nChrysotile asbestos fibers (National Institute of Environmental\nHealth Sciences reference sample, NIEHS), and Libby six-mix (Uni-\nted States Geological Service, USGS) have been physically and\nchemically characterized previously [21,24,27\u201330]. Glass beads\n(GB) from Polysciences Inc. were used as a noncytotoxic particle\ncontrol [29]. The surface area of chrysotile measured using\nMicromeritics Tristar equipment for nitrogen gas sorption analysis\nby Happond Expander\u2122 is reported to be 28.83 m2/g (Table 1). The\nChry and LIB fibers were sterilized under ultraviolet light overnight\nprior to suspension in HBSS at 1 mg/ml, sonication for 15 min in a\nwater bath sonicator, and trituration eight times through a 22-\ngauge needle before treatment of the cells [31]. Two mass-based\nconcentration systems have been commonly used in studies of\nasbestos exposure: (1) mass concentration, which means the mass\nof a constituent divided by the volume of a carrier and (2) mass-\nper-area, which is the mass divided by the exposed surface area.\nThe asbestos suspensions were directly added to differentiated\nmacrophages or BEAS-2B cells in medium at a mass concentration\nof 20 lg/ml and 40 lg/ml for 24 h, which was equivalent to mass\nper area of 5 lg/cm2 and 10 lg/cm2 achieved by adjusting the vol-\nume of medium based on the surface area of the culture dishes. The\nculture medium collected after exposure of THP-1 cells for 24 h\nwas centrifuged at the highest speed of an Eppendorf 5430R centri-\nfuge with 50 ml-tube rotor. Then the supernatant of medium was\nused to treat BEAS-2B cells and referred to as conditioned medium\nwith indicated asbestos concentration from the original THP-1\ntreatment. Since the conditioned medium contained no particles\nand the cellular responses to GB or medium alone were similar, a\nGB control was not included in the experiments using conditioned\nmedium.\n\n2.3. Caspase-1 inhibitor treatments\n\nA caspase-1 inhibitor VI, Z-YVAD-FMK (ZYF), was purchased\nfrom BioVison and a caspase-1 inhibitor V, Z-D-CH2-DCB (ZD),\nfrom Calbiochem. In preliminary experiments, 10, 20, 40 and\n50 lM of inhibitors were applied to THP-1 cell 30 min prior to\nasbestos treatment. After 24 h, the inhibitory effects on production\nof IL-1b were compared, suggesting that ZYF was more efficient\nthan ZD. Based on these preliminary results, only 40 lM of ZYF\nwas used in the subsequent experiments.\n\n2.4. IL-1b and IL-1Ra treatments\n\nRecombinant human IL-1b protein and the antibody for cleaved\nIL-1b were purchased from Cell Signaling. The IL-1 receptor antag-\nonist (IL-1Ra) was purchased from Abcam. BEAS-2B cells were\nchallenged in preliminary experiments by 10, 20, 40, 80, and\n100 ng/ml recombinant IL-1b to determine its effect on the secre-\ntion of IL-6. The inhibitory effects of both IL-1Ra and anti-IL-1b\n\n\n\nTable 1\nFiber size references.\n\nFiber name Mean fiber\nlength (lm)\n\nMean\nSA (m2/g)\n\nSource\n\nGlass beads (GB)a 2.06 3 Polysciences Inc\nChrysotile (Chry) 21b 28.83c NIEHS\nLIBBY-6-mix (LIB)d 7.21 5 USGS\n\na [29].\nb [30].\nc Nitrogen gas sorption analysis by Hammond Expanders\u2122.\nd [29].\n\n720 M. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730\nwere also tested and compared. Based on the preliminary results,\nonly 400 ng/ml of IL-1Ra was used in the subsequent experiments\nto treat BEAS-2B cells.\n\n2.5. CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay viability protocol\n\nThe CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay (Promega) uses a luminogenic peptide\nsubstrate (alanyl-alanylphenylalanyl-aminoluciferin; AAF-Glo\u2122\nSubstrate) to measure dead-cell protease activity, which is released\nfrom cells after loss of membrane integrity. The assay is primarily\ndesigned to selectively detect dead cells; however, with the addi-\ntion of the lysis reagent (provided in the kit), the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 As-\nsay viability protocol (by lysis) can also deliver the luminescent\nsignal associated with the total number of cells. Cells were grown\nand treated as described above and then trypsinized and passed\nthrough the 40 lm mesh to break the clusters of cells and asbestos\nfibers. The collected cells were then loaded into a 96-well plate and\nthe CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay reagents applied to wells sequentially fol-\nlowing the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The luminescent signals were\nmeasured in a Synergy HT4 multi-detection microplate reader\n(BioTek Instruments). Viability was calculated by subtracting the\nluminescent signal resulting from experimental cell death from to-\ntal luminescent values.\n\n2.6. LDH cytotoxicity assay\n\nThe CytoTox 96\ufffd cytotoxicity assay is a colorimetric assay from\nPromega. The assay quantitatively measures lactate dehydroge-\nnase (LDH), a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released upon cell ly-\nsis by treatments. Released LDH in culture supernatants was\nmeasured after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h treatments with an enzymatic\nassay, which results in the conversion of a tetrazolium salt (INT)\ninto a red formazan product. The amount of color formed is propor-\ntional to the number of lysed cells. Visible wavelength absorbance\ndata were collected at 490 nm with the Synergy HT4 (BioTek\nInstruments). The results are expressed as a percentage of maxi-\nmum LDH released from cells lysed by repeated freezing and\nthawing.\n\n2.7. Cytokine assays\n\nCells were grown and treated as described above; the culture\nmedium was then collected and centrifuged twice at 14,000 rpm\nin an Eppendorf 5430R centrifuge with a rotor for 1.5 ml-tubes,\nand the supernatants stored in \ufffd80 \ufffdC until analysis. Cytokines\nand chemokines were analyzed using both Bio-Plex Pro\u2122 Assay\n(Bio-Rad) and Milliplex Map\ufffd Assay (Millipore). Bio-Plex-27 hu-\nman cytokine kits were used in screening of cytokine responses,\nwhile Milliplex Map\ufffd custom kits were used for selected cytokines.\nThe samples were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions and run on the Bio-Plex suspension array system\n(Bio-Rad). Standard curves were calculated and samples were ana-\nlyzed using the Bio-Plex Manager software version 5 (Bio-Rad).\n2.8. Caspase-1 FLICA assay\n\nZ-YVAD-FMK caspase-1 FLICA kit was purchased from Immuno-\nchemistry Technologies, LLC. The methodology is based on a fluo-\nrochrome inhibitor of caspase-1, the FLICA reagent FAM-YVAD-\nFMK, which enters the cells and binds covalently only to the active\ncaspase-1. The asbestos-treated THP-1 cells were trypsinized and\npassed through the 40 lm mesh. 300 ll of each cell suspension,\nwhich contained at least 1 \ufffd 106 cells, were transferred to sterile\ntubes and incubated or washed sequentially with FLICA reagents\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The aliquots of cells were\nthen loaded into microtiter plate wells in different dilutions and\nfluorescence read on a Synergy HT4 with excitation range from\n488 to 492 nm, and emission range from 515 to 535 nm.\n2.9. Western-blot analysis\n\nThe antibodies for total or phospho-ERK1/2, caspase-1, total or\nphospho-NF-jB p65 (S536) were purchased from Cell Signaling;\nthe antibody for total Cot from Santa Cruz; the antibodies for phos-\npho-Cot (T290), b-actin and a-tubulin from Abcam Inc.; the anti-\nbodies for MnSOD, GCLC from Abnova; the antibody for NLRP3\nfrom AdipoGen; the antibody for 3-nitrotyrosine from Millipore.\nTotal or nuclear proteins were extracted from treated cells as de-\nscribed previously [32]. The 20 lg of each total protein was elec-\ntrophoresed on 10% or 7.5% Mini-PROTEAN\ufffd TGX\u2122 precast gels\n(Bio-Rad) and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes.\nAfter blocking the membranes with 1% BSA blocking/dilution buf-\nfer, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary\nantibody at the recommended concentration overnight with shak-\ning at 4 \ufffdC and then rinsed. After incubation with corresponding\nsecondary antibodies, the protein bands were visualized using a\nSuperSignal\u2122 West Pico Trial Kit (PIERCE) and exposed to radio-\ngraphic films.

Oxidized protein detection\n\nProtein carbonyl modifications were detected and quantified\nusing the OxyBLOT\u2122 Assay (Millipore) according the manufac-\nturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, BEAS-2B cells were treated with Chry\nand LIB and protein lysates were incubated with 2, 4-dinitrophen-\nylhydrazine (DNPH). The DNP-derivative protein samples were\nseparated by SDS\u2013PAGE followed by Western blotting. The same\nmembranes were stripped and then reimmunoblotted with b-actin\nas a loading control.\n2.11. Lipid and aqueous peroxides assay\n\nLipid and aqueous peroxides in THP-1 conditioned medium\nwere measured with the OxiSelect\u2122 Hydrogen Peroxide Assay\nKit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nPeroxide in the medium converts Fe2+ into Fe3+, which reacts with\nan equal molar amount in the presence of acid to create a purple\nproduct that absorbs maximally between 540 and 600 nm. Sam-\nples were then reacted with xylenol orange in 96-well plate and\nread on the Synergy HT4. The peroxide content in unknown sam-\nples was calculated by comparison with the predetermined H2O2\nstandard curve.\n\n\n\nM. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 721\n2.12.

The probes were labeled with [c-32P] ATP\nusing T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) according to the man-\nufacturer\u2019s protocol. EMSA was performed as described previously\n[33]. The 6 lg of nuclear extracts from BEAS-2B cells exposed to\nChry, LIB or 10 ng/ml of TNF-a were used in the binding assay;\n1 ll of anti c-Fos antibody (Santa Cruz) were applied to supershift\nthe AP-1 complexes, respectively; cold AP-1 probes were also in-\ncluded at 1:100 M ratios for probe competition.\n\n2.13.

Cell viability and cytotoxicity. THP-1 cells differentiated with 100 nM PMA\nwere refreshed and exposed to 20 lg/ml or 40 lg/ml of chrysotile (Chry20, Chry40)\nand LIB (Lib20, Lib40), and 40 lg/ml glass beads (GB).

Results\n\n3.1. Cell viability in response to asbestos exposure\n\nCell viabilities were assessed with the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay and\nresults shown in Fig. 1A and B. Differences between the two cell\nlines were found in the responses to direct exposure of THP-1\nand BEAS-2B cells to 20 or 40 lg/ml of Chry (Chry20, Chry40)\nand LIB (Lib20, Lib40). After 24 h of exposure, Chry significantly re-\nduced the survival of THP-I cells compared to control, whereas LIB\nhad less of an effect (Fig. 1A). No reduction of cell viability was\nseen in BEAS-2B cells with the treatments compared to control;\nhowever, cell number based on the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay slightly\nincreased with LIB treatments (Fig. 1B). To confirm the result from\nFig. 1A, a LDH cytotoxicity assay was used in THP cells treated with\nChry and LIB for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h (Fig. 1C). Cell death gradually\nincreased with increasing exposure times. By 24 h, Chry40 had in-\nduced significant cell death (\ufffd60%), with lesser degrees induced by\nChry20, LIB40 and LIB20. Together the data indicate selective cyto-\ntoxicity in macrophages exposed to asbestos compared to epithe-\nlial cells.\n\n3.2. IL-1b and caspase-1 responses in THP-1 cells\n\nCytokine and chemokine concentrations were measured in the\nsupernatant of the culture medium from treated THP-1 cells using\nthe human Bio-Plex array (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for\ncomplete set of data). IL-1b was the most prominently induced\ncytokine. Fig. 2A shows the results of induction of IL-1b in 3 inde-\npendent experiments when THP-1 cells were treated with Chry\nand LIB for 24 h. Chry20 induced a 4-fold and Chry40 a 6-fold in-\ncrease in IL-1b secretion compared to the control; whereas Lib40\ninduced IL-1b secretion by only 2.9-fold. Meanwhile GB and con-\ntrol resulted in similar levels of IL-1b. Other cytokines found to\nbe significantly induced included IL-1Ra, G-CSF and IL-2 (see Sup-\nplementary Table 2).\n\nThe combination of cell death and IL-1b secretion suggested the\npossible involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3\nexpression was hence determined by Western-blot and showed\nthat NLRP3 protein level was higher in all treatments compared\nto control. However, none of treatments achieved statistical signif-\nicance compared to control (Fig. 2B).\n\nPro-caspase-1, an assembling member of the inflammasome\ncomplex, is proteolytically activated from a proenzyme to produce\ntwo active subunits, p20 and p10, with p20 being identifiable by\nimmuno-blotting. Fig. 3A shows a representative blot and a sum-\nmary of data obtained from three independent experiments. Re-\nsults suggest that active p20 was induced by the Chry\ntreatments, especially Chry40, but to a lesser degree by LIB treat-\nments with no effect by GB. To further confirm the activation of\ncaspase-1 in Chry-treatments, the caspase-1 FLICA assay was per-\nformed and the result revealed that Chry40 clearly increased cas-\npase-1 activity in the THP-1 cells (Fig. 3B).\n\nThe activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1b are two\nimportant consequences of inflammasome activation. To verify\nwhether blocking caspase-1 activation would reduce maturation\nof IL-1b in macrophages, a caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK\n(ZYF) was used in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and treated with\n40 lg/ml asbestos. Application of ZYF showed a trend towards\n\n\n\nFig. 2. IL_1b release and NLRP3 priming. (A) Release of IL-1b in THP-1 cells was analyzed with a Bio-Plex 27 cytokine array.

Meanwhile, Fig. 3C shows\nthat IL-1b was significantly induced by Chry20 and Chry40 with\nless effect of Lib40 and no effect of GB. ZYF significantly repressed\nthe Chry40 and Lib40 effects resulting in little IL-1b detectable in\nthe medium. These results suggest that IL-1b secretion in response\nto asbestos is caspase-1 dependent.\n\n3.3. Comparison of ROS production in Chry and LIB treated THP-1 cells\n\nOxidative stress is another potential mediator for particle-in-\nduced inflammation in cells. Two antioxidant related enzymes,\nFig. 3. Activation of caspase-1.

IL-1b levels in media analyzed with Milliplex Pl\nChry or LIB treatments with control; \ufffd indicates p 6 0.05 when comparing ZYF-treated v\nsuperoxide dismutase (SOD) and c-glutamate cysteine ligase cata-\nlytic subunit (GCLC), were selected as the indicators of oxidative\nstatus since SOD expression is often low in the presence of oxida-\ntive stress whereas GCLC expression is induced if cells are chal-\nlenged by a reduction in GSH levels. Blake et al. have reported in\nmurine macrophages that internalization of LIB asbestos fibers\ngenerated a significant increase in intracellular ROS, decreased\nGSH levels, and impaired total SOD activity [34]. To clarify the oxi-\ndative stress status in Chry- and LIB- treated THP-1 cells, the\nexpression of manganese SOD (MnSOD) and GCLC were compared\nby Western blots. The upper panel of Fig. 4A shows protein blots of\nthe two enzymes in THP-1 cells treated with either Chry or LIB; the\ning both active p20 subunits and other caspase-1 protein components in Chry- and\ntor, ZYF. b-actin in the same blot served as a loading control.

Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 723\nlower bar-graphs summarizes MnSOD and GCLC expression in\nthree experiments. Induction of MnSOD was found in response to\nChry but not seen in GB and LIB-treated cells. Meanwhile, an in-\ncrease of GCLC was seen in LIB treated cells but there was little\nin GB and Chry-treated cells. The difference between the responses\nto Chry and LIB treatments suggests that the two particulates in-\nduced oxidative stress to different degrees. Protein carbonyl mod-\nifications were then determined using the OxyBLOT\u2122 Assay. A\nrepresentative blot (Fig. 4B) shows that THP-1 cells treated with\nLib40 displayed a dramatic increase in the number and degree of\noxidized proteins as compared to control, GB and Chry40-treated\ncells. This suggests that more oxidative stress is generated by LIB\namphiboles compared to Chry. Reactive nitrogen species is another\nindicator of oxidative stress. Protein tyrosine nitration in Chry- and\nLIB- treated THP-1 cells was also compared and shown in a repre-\nsentative blot in Fig. 4C. LIB induced more 3-nitrotyrosine forma-\ntion than Chry treatments. Finally, the existence of lipid\nperoxides in conditioned medium was evaluated with the OxiSe-\nlect\u2122 Hydrogen Peroxide Assay as shown in Fig. 4D. LIB treatments\nresulted in more lipid peroxide in conditioned medium than Chry\ntreatments with most of the peroxide found in the lipid rather than\naqueous fraction. There was a significant difference between the\nresponses to Lib20 compared to Chry20.\n\n3.4. Role of IL-1b in BEAS-2B responses to THP-1-conditioned medium\n\nBEAS-2B cells were directly treated with Chry and LIB for 24 h.\nThe induction of IL-6 by direct exposure of epithelial cells to Chry\nhas been described elsewhere [17,35]; therefore in the present\nwork, Chry-40 was used as a \u2018\u2018positive control\u2019\u2019. IL-6 was found\nto be significantly induced by Chry40 and less so by Lib40 in di-\nrectly treated BEAS-2B cells, as shown in Fig. 5A.\n\nBEAS-2B cells were then grown in THP-1 conditioned medium\nfor 24 h as well. Because the IL-1b levels in GB-conditioned med-\nium was consistent with control, as described in Section 3.2, GB-\nconditioned medium was not used in the conditionally treated\nBEAS-2B cells. Several cytokines were found to be induced by con-\nditioned medium (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The most\nsignificant change occurred in IL-6 levels as shown in Fig. 5B. In\ncomparison to Fig. 5A, direct treatment with Chry40 induced a\n4.8-fold increase of IL-6 compared to control; whereas the increase\nin IL-6 by Chry40-conditioned medium was only 1.5-fold. The in-\ncrease in IL-6 by LIB-conditioned medium was less than seen with\nChry-conditioned medium. These data support the contention that\ninduction of IL-6 by THP-1 conditioned medium may be related to\nIL-1b.\n\nActivation of the MAPK cascade is a prominent finding in epi-\nthelial cells directly treated with asbestos [16,36]. Recently, an-\nother inflammatory protein kinase, Cot (cancer osaka thyroid\noncogene), which is also known as Tpl2 (tumor progression locus\n2) or MAP3K8 and functions upstream of MAPK signaling has been\ndescribed [37]. BEAS-2B cells directly treated with Chry and LIB\nparticles showed increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and phos-\nphorylation of Cot kinase at Tyr290 compared to control (see Sup-\nplementary Fig. 1A and B). To determine whether conditioned\nmedium had the same stimulatory function as directly treated\nBEAS-2B cells, activation of ERK and Cot was examined in BEAS-\n2B cells treated with THP-1 conditioned medium. Fig. 6A shows\ninduction of P-ERK and P-Cot by Chry- and LIB-conditioned med-\nium, similar to effects seen in directly treated cells.\n\nSince the transcription factor NF-jB has also been suggested to\nplay a key role in the regulation of IL-6 expression and IL-1b is\nknown to specifically induce phosphorylation of NF-jB p65 at\nSer536 [38], the phosphorylation status of NF-jB p65 at Ser536\nwas also examined in conditionally treated BEAS-2B cells. The re-\nsults revealed that phosphorylation of NF-jB p65 at Ser536 was in-\nduced by Chry40-conditioned medium (Fig. 6B). Activation of AP-1,\nwhich is downstream of MAPK pathways, is another important fea-\nture of asbestos-treated epithelial cells. Thus, the binding activity\nof AP-1 was compared by EMSA, as shown in Fig. 6C, and demon-\nstrated that the binding activity of AP-1 was augmented by both\nChry40 and Lib20 conditioned medium.\n\nTo determine if IL-1b itself could activate BEAS-2B cells to se-\ncrete IL-6 as it appears to have done with conditioned medium,\nwe treated cells with recombinant human IL-1b protein. IL-1Ra,\nan antagonist protein of IL-1b, was also used in parallel to test its\neffect on inhibition of IL-1b. Fig. 7A summarizes the IL-1b effect\non IL-6 secretion. Treatment of BEAS-2B with 10 ng/ml of IL-1b in-\nduced \ufffd1.6-fold increase in IL-6 secretion compared to control, but\nincreasing the dose beyond 10 ng/ml did not show a dose-depen-\ndent increase of IL-6 (data not shown). The effect of 100 ng/ml of\nIL-1b on IL-6 was even lower than the effect of 10 ng/ml. This find-\ning is consistent with an effective dose in pharmacology (ED50)\nwhere the ED50 of recombinant IL-1b is commonly reported to\nbe much less than 10 ng/ml. The IL-1Ra molecule is structurally re-\nlated to IL-1b but has mutations rendering it incapable of forming a\ncomplex with IL-1b/IL-1RI/IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-\n1RAcP) [39]. IL-1Ra-treatment did successfully suppress IL-6\nsecretion.\n\nAlthough BEAS-2B cells treated with conditioned medium did\nnot have direct contact with asbestos fibers, both direct and condi-\ntioned medium treatments resulted in phosphorylation of MAPK\nand secretion of IL-6. In addition, IL-1b itself can stimulate BEAS-\n2B in the same manner. The component in the conditioned med-\nium that mediated the inflammatory message from THP-1 cells\nto BEAS-2B cells is likely to be IL-1b. The specificity of the IL-1b ef-\nfect in conditioned medium was hence tested by IL-1Ra to see\nwhether IL-1Ra competitively blocked IL-1b in the conditioned\nmedium and consequently affected the cellular responses of\nBEAS-2B cells. BEAS-2B cells were treated with THP-1-conditioned\nmedium, in addition to Chry40 and Lib40 with or without 40 lM of\nZYF (Chry40, Chry40 + ZYF, Lib40, Lib40 + ZYF) for 24 h. 400 ng/ml\nof IL-1Ra inhibitor was added to another set of Chry40- or Lib40-\nconditioned media (Chry40 + IL-1Ra, Lib40 + IL-1Ra). Fig. 7B illus-\ntrates the corresponding changes in IL-6 by the Milli-Plex 2 Assay\ndone in triplicate. Conditioned medium of Chry40 + ZYF slightly\ndecreased IL-6; however, addition of IL-1Ra to Chry40-conditioned\nmedium had a much greater effect on the suppression of IL-6 re-\nlease. In contrast, LIB treatments showed the same trends, but\nnone of the differences reached significance. Fig. 7C shows a repre-\nsentative of Western-blots on the top and two summary graphs be-\nlow. Results in Fig. 7C indicates the same trend of the inhibitory\neffects of IL-1Ra on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Cot by\nChry40-conditioned medium.\n\nIn summary, both IL-6 and MAPK results demonstrate that\nblocking of IL-1b leads to down-regulation of the effects of\nChry40-conditioned medium on BEAS-2B. This suggests that IL-\n1b in Chry-conditioned medium is responsible for triggering\ninflammatory responses in BEAS-2B cells. In contrast, blocking of\nIL-1b appears to play a smaller role in the effects induced by LIB.\n\n3.5. Comparison of cytotoxicity and inflammatory effects based on\nmatched surface area\n\nWe have compared the effects of Chry and LIB using mass con-\ncentrations of 20 and 40 lg/ml that is equivalent to mass-per-area\nof 5 and 10 lg/cm2. To further evaluate whether the total surface\narea (SA) of particles affected the respective responses, the other\napproach which measures \u2018\u2018the total surface area per unit of\ncross-sectional area\u2019\u2019 was also examined. According to the refer-\nenced SA values shown in Table 1, the SA of Chry is 28.83 m2/g, Lib-\nby-6 mix is 5 m2/g, and the GB control is 3 m2/g. Two\n\n\n\nFig. 4.

Although both\nparticles had shown similar trends of cytotoxicity, Chry elicited a\ntotally different inflammatory response than LIB. Release of IL-1b\nin Fig. 8C was dramatically increased in Chry150 with an opposite\neffect with Lib150, suggesting that Chry150 resulted in an inflam-\nmatory form of cell death with increased cytokines; whereas\nLib150 resulted in a cell death without inflammation.

These data suggest that Chry had a much\ngreater effect on IL-1b and IL-6 secretion than LIB, which was inde-\npendent of matched total surface area.\n\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. IL-1b acts as a secondary mediator\n\nThe present data elucidate the role of IL-1b in the primary re-\nsponses of the macrophage and its interaction with epithelial cells\nas follows: (1) when exposed to Chry and LIB, THP-1 cells under-\nwent a caspase-1 mediated inflammasome activation that resulted\nin an inflammatory form of cell death which now known as pyrop-\ntosis [40] and produced the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1b; (2)\nexogenous IL-1b treatment activated BEAS-2B and triggered\nBEAS-2B inflammatory responses; (3) THP-1 conditioned medium,\ncontaining secreted IL-1b, mimicked the effect of IL-1b treatment;\nand (4) blocking IL-1b by IL-1Ra antagonist protein diminished the\neffects of conditioned medium on BEAS-2B. Together, it appears\nthat the IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium acts as the secondary\nmediator that stimulates the BEAS-2B immune response to Chry\nand LIB.\n\nHowever, activation of target cells by IL-1b is tightly regulated\nat many levels, both extracellularly and intracellularly [39,41].\nThe extracellular regulation includes the presence of naturally\noccurring inhibitors, such as the receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra. In\naddition to the release of IL-1b, THP-1 cells also released IL-1Ra\nsimultaneously, as shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Thus,\nthe effect of endogenous IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium\nwas naturally restricted when it was applied to BEAS-2B cells. All\nof these inhibitory effects could explain why a dramatic 10-fold\nhigher level of IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium treated with\nChry40 was limited to only 1.5-fold greater release of IL-6 by\nBEAS-2B cells.\n\n4.2. Chry and LIB differentially activate the inflammasome in THP-1\ncells\n\nIn the present work, through comparison of THP-1 cells re-\nsponses to Chry with LIB, we demonstrated that chrysotile asbestos\nhas more effect on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome than\nLIB. Although Fig. 2B did not show that the NLRP3 expression in\nChry treatments is higher than in LIB, activation of caspase-1 and\nrelease of IL-1b were greater in Chry than LIB treatments. NLRP3\ninflammasome activation has been defined as a rapid process in\nwhich caspase-1 cleavage is induced. The process is independent\nof upstream de novo transcription [42]. Cell priming through mul-\ntiple signaling receptors that induce NLRP3 expression is necessary\n\n\n\nFig. 8.

Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 727\nbut not sufficient for NLRP3 activation [43]. This priming can be\novercome solely by constitutive NLRP3 expression. Actually, mac-\nrophages appear to express high levels of NLRP3 constitutively\nand can bypass the requirement of NLRP3 expression [44,45].\nTherefore, it is the activation of caspase-1, rather than expression\nof NLRP3, that is a key indicator of activation of NLRP3 inflamma-\nsome in THP-1 cells.\n\nEnvironmental toxicants (such as asbestos) and damage-associ-\nated molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate the NLRP3 inflamma-\nsome, but the mechanisms by which these structurally distinct\nmolecules trigger NLRP3 oligomerization and inflammasome acti-\nvation are currently unclear and have been intensely debated in\nthe literature [46]. A model in which the generation of ROS is\none of the crucial elements for NLRP3 activation has been sug-\ngested [47]. However, recent studies in mice and humans defective\nin the generation of ROS failed to support this hypothesis and\nstrongly suggested anti-inflammatory effects of ROS [48,49]. Fur-\nthermore, SOD was reported to be required for the activation of\ncaspase-1; SOD1 deficiency led to more ROS in macrophages but\ncaused caspase-1 inhibition by specific oxidation and glutathiony-\nlation [50].\n\nIn this study, Chry did not generate more intracellular ROS than\nLIB (Fig. 4), which was associated with more protein oxidation and\ntyrosine nitration. In addition, Chry promoted production of\nMnSOD protein but LIB did not. It seems unlikely that ROS were\ndriving activation of the inflammasome in Chry treated THP-1 cells.\n\nHowever, an alternative model of inflammasome activation that\ntakes into account the size of the activators is the lysosome rupture\nmodel, which is particularly useful in explaining NLRP3 inflamma-\nsome activation by large particulate activators, such as Chry.\nAccording to this model, when phagocytosed particulates are too\nlarge to be efficiently cleared, inefficient clearance of the activating\nparticle following phagocytosis leads to phagosomal destabiliza-\ntion and lysosomal rupture [47]. Lysosomal damage results in the\nrelease of lysosomal proteases into the cytosol that mediates\nNLRP3 inflammasome activation [51,52]. Since the selected model\nfor inflammasome activation is closely related to the particulate\nsize, it is reasonable to link the consequences of THP-1 cells in re-\nsponse to Chry and LIB with their remarkably different physical\nsizes. Chrysotile fibers belong to the group of longer and thinner fi-\nbers; the length of Chry is about 3 times that of LIB, and the mean\nsurface area is about 5\u20136 times that of LIB (see Table 1), suggesting\nthat Chry has more potential to result in aggressive lysosomal rup-\nture and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. It has\nbeen well-demonstrated that longer fibers are incapable of under-\ngoing phagocytosis in vitro and in animals [21]. Long fibers have a\ngreater potency than short fibers in assays of pro-inflammatory\nand genotoxic activity [53], and stimulate greater release of IL-1b\nby macrophages [5]. Therefore, further study of the correlations\nbetween particle size and activation of the inflammasome would\nbe particularly interesting. In contrast, LIB probably stimulates\nmore ROS production via a tightly controlled ROS-mediated model\n[51] in which, ROS primes NLRP3 on the one hand, but may impact\ninflammasome activation and down-regulate caspase-1 activity on\nthe other hand.\n\n4.3. Signaling cascade in BEAS-2B cells mediated by the conditioned\nmedium\n\nWe have demonstrated that IL-1b is a major player in THP-1\nconditioned medium, leading to the initiation of the inflammatory\nresponse in the BEAS-2B cells. Besides IL-1b, we also detected lip-\nids peroxides in conditioned medium (Fig. 4D) which is possibly\nanother \u2018\u2018alarm\u2019\u2019 signal that triggers responses in BEAS-2B. How-\never, this should be specifically identified and confirmed in future\nstudies.\n\nCombining our findings with those from others, the process\nthrough which IL-1b triggers BEAS-2B release of IL-6 likely consists\n\n\n\nFig. 9. Proposed schema for Chry and LIB induced signal transduction from the macrophage to the epithelium. In the macrophage \u2018\u2018priming\u2019\u2019 step, the pro-inflammatory\nsignals mediate activation of receptors and induction of NLRP3, procaspase-1 and pro-IL-1b. When macrophages are exposed to chrysotile fibers, phagocytosis is followed by\nphagosomal destabilization and lysosomal rupture. Lysosomal damage results in the release of cathepsin B into the cytosol that triggers three members of NLRP3\ninflammasome to assemble and subsequent activation of ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD). This second step eventually activates pro-caspase-\n1, which in turn cleaves pro-IL-1b. In comparison to chrysotile, the relatively smaller size of the Libby amphibole probably results in more ROS production via a tightly\ncontrolled ROS-mediated model in which, ROS activate NLRP3, although high oxygen tension can also impact inflammasome function and down-regulate caspase-1 activity.\nIn the epithelial cell, IL-1b signal transduction is initiated through a ligand-induced conformational change in the first extracellular domain of the IL-1RI that facilitates\nrecruitment of IL-1RacP. Meanwhile, IL-1Ra can block the IL-1b signaling. The trimetric complex rapidly assembles two intracellular signaling proteins, MYD88, and IRAK,\nthen through TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) linked to the downstream protein kinase cascades, including MAPK kinase family, Cot and IjB kinases (IKKs). The\nactivation of ERK1/2 or other MAPKs leads to activation of the AP-1 transcription factor; the IKKb-mediated phosphorylation of p65 modulates NF-jB activity. Both AP-1 and\nNF-jB can directly up-regulate its target gene, IL-6. IL-6 further contributes to asbestos-related pathological phenotypes, such as asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma.\n\n728 M. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730\n\n\n\nM. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 729\nof the following steps, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The initial step in IL-\n1b signal transduction is a ligand-induced conformational change\nin the first extracellular domain of the IL-1RI that facilitates\nrecruitment of IL-1RacP. Through conserved cytosolic regions\ncalled Toll- and IL-1R-like (TIR) domains, the trimetric complex\nrapidly assembles two intracellular signaling proteins, myeloid dif-\nferentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and interleukin-1\nreceptor\u2013activated protein kinase (IRAK) [41]. The IL-1R\ufffdTLR\nreceptor-mediated signals, which are linked to the downstream\nprotein kinase cascades, have been studied extensively. Members\nof the MAPK kinase (MAPKKK; called MAP3 K here) family, includ-\ning MEKK1, 2, 3 and Cot (Tpl2 or MAP3K8) are critical in this pro-\ncess [54\u201356]. The activation of ERK1/2 or other MAPKs leads to\nactivation of the AP-1 transcription factor, which could directly\nup-regulate its target gene, IL-6. In addition, the IKKb-mediated\nphosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 requires the upstream kinases\nCot (Tpl2) and PKCf [57]. Then, in turn, IL-6 may act as a significant\nautocrine growth factor in epithelial cells [58,59] to further induce\nasbestos-related pathological phenotypes, such as asbestosis, lung\ncancer, and mesothelioma.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nWe have investigated the signal transduction from the THP-1\nmacrophages to bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) in response\nto Chry and LIB through direct treatments of THP-1 cells followed\nby THP-1 conditioned medium treatments of BEAS-2B. We found\nthat direct treatments of THP-1 cells with Chry and LIB differen-\ntially activated the inflammasome in processing IL-1b. IL-1b in con-\nditioned medium acts as a secondary mediator to trigger BEAS-2B\ncells signaling cascades, including ERK, Cot, and then AP-1 and NF-\nkB, to induce IL-6, which then leads epithelial cells to pathologic\nphenotypes. Using IL-1Ra could interrupt the interaction and\nmay have a potential therapeutic effect when exposure to patho-\ngenic particles occurs.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Brooke T.
