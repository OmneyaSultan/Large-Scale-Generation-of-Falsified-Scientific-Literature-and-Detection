Kamdar2\u00a4, Mrinal K. Maiti1,2*\n\n1 Advanced Laboratory for Plant Genetic Engineering, Advanced Technology Development Centre, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India,\n\n2 Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India\n\nAbstract\n\nDiacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity is an essential enzymatic step in the formation of neutral lipid i.e.,\ntriacylglycerol in all living cells capable of accumulating storage lipid. Previously, we characterized an oleaginous yeast\nCandida tropicalis SY005 that yields storage lipid up to 58% under a specific nitrogen-stress condition, when the DGAT-\nspecific transcript is drastically up-regulated. Here we report the identification, differential expression and function of two\nDGAT2 gene homologues- CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b of this C. tropicalis. Two protein isoforms are unique with respect to the\npresence of five additional stretches of amino acids, besides possessing three highly conserved motifs known in other\nreported DGAT2 enzymes. Moreover, the CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b are characteristically different in amino acid sequences\nand predicted protein structures. The CtDGAT2b isozyme was found to be catalytically 12.5% more efficient than CtDGAT2a\nfor triacylglycerol production in a heterologous yeast system i.e., Saccharomyces cerevisiae quadruple mutant strain H1246\nthat is inherently defective in neutral lipid biosynthesis. The CtDGAT2b activity rescued the growth of transformed S.\ncerevisiae mutant cells, which are usually non-viable in the medium containing free fatty acids by incorporating them into\ntriacylglycerol, and displayed preferential specificity towards saturated acyl species as substrate. Furthermore, we document\nthat the efficiency of triacylglycerol production by CtDGAT2b is differentially affected by deletion, insertion or replacement\nof amino acids in five regions exclusively present in two CtDGAT2 isozymes. Taken together, our study characterizes two\nstructurally novel DGAT2 isozymes, which are accountable for the enhanced production of storage lipid enriched with\nsaturated fatty acids inherently in C. tropicalis SY005 strain as well as in transformed S. cerevisiae neutral lipid-deficient\nmutant cells. These two genes certainly will be useful for further investigation on the novel structure-function relationship\nof DGAT repertoire, and also in metabolic engineering for the enhanced production of lipid feedstock in other organisms.\n\nCitation: Dey P, Chakraborty M, Kamdar MR, Maiti MK (2014) Functional Characterization of Two Structurally Novel Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase2 Isozymes\nResponsible for the Enhanced Production of Stearate-Rich Storage Lipid in Candida tropicalis SY005.

Studies in the past decade have documented\n\nthat oleaginous microbes are complementary sources (or even\n\nsuperior in few instances) to plant and animals for lipid feedstock\n\nrequired for various applications in food and nonfood industries\n\n[2\u20135]. The predominant component of microbial storage lipid is\n\ntriacylglycerol (TAG), which is a non-polar, water-insoluble ester\n\nof glycerol with three fatty acids. TAG molecules are stored in\n\nspecialized sub-cellular organelles, known as lipid droplets or lipid\n\nbodies that are enclosed within monolayer of phospholipids and\n\nhydrophobic proteins. Lipid bodies of some oleaginous microbes\n\nalso contain small proportion of steryl esters. Lipid body structures\n\nare also found in plant seeds, and analogous to animal adiposomes.\n\nThe TAG is a pivotal component in living organisms for lipid\n\nhomeostasis, which is fundamental to biological membrane\n\nsystems and signal transduction processes; in addition to its role\n\nin storage of energy and carbon required for cellular activities.\n\nTAG molecules of lipid bodies may serve to sequester the harmful\n\nlipids or unusual free fatty acids that are toxic to the cells.\n\nMoreover, the TAG turnover is related to several pathological\n\nconditions in animals including human, e.g. obesity, coronary\n\nheart disease, hypertriglyceridemia and type-2 diabetes. On the\n\nother hand, the TAG metabolism is crucial for plant-pathogen\n\ninteraction, pollen maturation, seed development and seedling\n\ngermination in plants; whereas TAG metabolism has important\n\nrole in starvation, cellular growth and development in microor-\n\nganisms. Therefore, proper understanding of the TAG metabolism\n\nand its role in lipid homeostasis is central to several aspects of basic\n\nand applied researches, including healthcare and bioenergy.\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e94472\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0094472&domain=pdf\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0094472&domain=pdf\n\n\nThe major route to TAG biosynthesis that is conserved in all\n\neukaryotic organisms including yeasts is the acyl-CoA-dependent\n\nKennedy pathway, where the fatty acids are supplied to glycerol\n\nmolecules as acyl-CoA species. In this pathway, the acyl-\n\nCoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT, EC 2.3.1.20) catalyzes\n\nthe final and committed step to transfer the 3\nrd\n\nfatty acid to the\n\ndiacylglycerol (DAG) to make TAG. On the contrary, in the acyl-\n\nCoA-independent route of TAG formation in mammals, plants\n\nand yeasts, the transfer of 3\nrd\n\nfatty acid to DAG occurs from\n\nanother DAG or phospholipid by separate enzymes. Thus, the\n\nDGAT is a key regulatory enzyme associated mainly with the\n\nendoplasmic reticulum to pool the carbon and energy flux towards\n\nTAG production in eukaryotes. There are at least two known\n\nmicrosomal DGAT family members, DGAT1 (type-1 DGAT) and\n\nDGAT2 (type-2 DGAT), which do not share substantial sequence\n\nhomology, and are proposed to have distinct physiological roles in\n\nTAG metabolism in microbes, plants and animals [6]. DGAT1 is\n\na member of the superfamily of membrane-bound O-acyltrans-\n\nferases [7], whereas the DGAT2 belongs to a family that includes\n\nacyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase and acyl-CoA:wax\n\nalcohol acyltransferase [8]. In contrast to these enzyme families,\n\na soluble form of DGAT has been identified in cotyledons of\n\nArachis hypogaea [9] and Arabidopsis thaliana [10], and is grouped into\n\nthe DGAT3 (type-3 DGAT) family. There is another class of\n\nDGAT enzymes known as the \u2018PDAT family\u2019, members of which\n\nutilize the acyl group from phosphatidylcholine for the TAG\n\nbiosynthesis [11], in one of the acyl-CoA-independent routes\n\nmentioned earlier. A novel bifunctional DGAT/wax ester\n\nsynthase (ADP1) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus has been identified,\n\nwhich is responsible for the synthesis of wax esters as the main\n\nconstituent of storage lipid in addition to a minor amount of TAGs\n\n[12].\n\nOrthologues of both DGAT1 and DGAT2 have been found to\n\nbe widely distributed in plants and animals. Although DGAT2\n\ngenes are very common among the fungi and algae, the DGAT1\n\ngene is rare in these microorganisms [6,13,14]. Reverse genetic\n\nstudies in DGAT knock-out mice have demonstrated that the\n\nDGAT2 plays a dominant role in TAG biosynthesis in mammals\n\n[15]. Expression levels of DGAT2 are also considered to be related\n\nto the skin disease psoriasis [16]. Therefore, DGAT2 represents an\n\nimportant therapeutic target for management or treatment of\n\nthese disorders. In certain plant species, such as castor bean and\n\ntung tree (Vernicia fordii) DGAT2 plays a role in the selective\n\naccumulation of unusual fatty acids into TAG [17,18]. Overex-\n\npression of the DGAT2 gene in crop plants represents a potential\n\nmean of producing novel value-added oils to meet the growing\n\ndemands from various industries [19]. A number of studies have\n\nbeen carried out to understand the fatty acid biosynthesis and lipid\n\nproduction pathways to alter the quality and quantity of storage\n\nlipid in higher plants. Overexpression of key enzymes of the\n\nKennedy pathway (in contrast to the prokaryotic or plastidial\n\npathway responsible for fatty acid biosynthesis) is by far the most\n\nsuccessful strategy until now to increase the content of storage lipid\n\nin Brassica napus, Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum [20\u201323].\n\nIn recent years, it has been suggested by many researchers that\n\nthe genetic engineering of key factors of lipid production pathways\n\ncould be a promising approach to increase the storage lipid\n\ncontent in plant, microalgae and fungi including yeasts for\n\neconomic production of lipid feedstocks, which may be useful in\n\nseveral applications, such as biodiesel and nutraceuticals. The\n\nDGAT gene is one such crucial regulatory factor towards TAG\n\naccumulation, as explained earlier. Realizing the importance of\n\nDGAT enzyme in storage lipid production for various aspects,\n\nseveral scientists all over the world are engaged in biochemistry,\n\nmolecular biology and biotechnology of this enzyme [6]. Hence, it\n\nis indispensable for bioprospecting diverse microorganisms from\n\nvarious ecological niches for DGAT enzymes having novel\n\nstructure and function, eventually to redesign the TAG biosyn-\n\nthesis pathway in bioreactor for greater yield of lipid feedstock.\n\nThere are not many reports on the characterization of the genes\n\nencoding for DGAT enzymes in oleaginous yeast species available\n\ntill date. One DGAT1 from the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica\n\n[24] and a soluble DGAT in another oleaginous yeast Rhodotorula\n\nglutinis [25] have been studied. To our knowledge, one such\n\npublished report so far exists on DGAT2 from Y. lipolytica [26].\n\nVery recently, we have characterized an oleaginous yeast Candida\n\ntropicalis isolate SY005 that can produce storage lipid up to 58%\n\nunder the specific nitrogen-limiting condition (having a C:N ratio\n\nof 150:1), when a drastic (,22 fold) up-regulation of DGAT-\nspecific transcript was observed unlike the situation for malic\n\nenzyme gene [27]. From the transcript profiling data, it was\n\nanticipated that different homologues of DGAT gene in the C.\n\ntropicalis might be responsible for the enhanced accumulation of\n\nstorage lipid during specific nitrogen-stress condition.\n\nTherefore, we aimed to investigate on the molecular nature of\n\nthe DGAT-specific activity that was responsible for the enhanced\n\nproduction of storage lipid in this particular yeast strain. The\n\npresent report documents molecular cloning of the two homo-\n\nlogues of DGAT2 gene from C. tropicalis SY005 strain followed by\n\nbioinformatics analyses and heterologous expression of the cloned\n\ngenes in neutral lipid-deficient mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain\n\nH1246. The study reveals that two isozymes - CtDGAT2a and\n\nCtDGAT2b, are not only structurally unique among other\n\nreported DGAT2s, but characteristically different from each other\n\nin predicted protein structures and biochemical functions. The\n\nmolecular nature of two novel DGAT2 gene homologues of C.\n\ntropicalis SY005 strain explains the phenotypic trait for enhanced\n\nproduction of storage lipid enriched with saturated fatty acids in\n\nendogenous and heterologous yeast systems.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCloning of the CtDGAT2 gene from C. tropicalis SY005\nisolate\n\nThe BLAST analysis was carried out to search for the gene\n\nencoding the DGAT-like protein in the Candida tropicalis sequences\n\navailable in NCBI database. Amino acid sequence of the\n\nYALI0E32769g protein (a major acyl-CoA dependent DGAT\n\nfrom oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica and an orthologue of S.\n\ncerevisiae DGAT2 family) was used as the input sequence to find out\n\nrelated protein(s) in C. tropicalis. Among the 9 hits obtained through\n\nBLAST search within the nonredundant protein database of\n\nCandida group, the sequence with highest level of amino acid\n\nidentity with the YALI0E32769g was found to be an unchar-\n\nacterized hypothetical protein of 569 amino acids [GenBank\n\naccession number XP_002546731.1, indicated by black arrow in\n\nFigure S1A], belonging to the C. tropicalis MYA-3404 strain. This\n\nhypothetical protein also contains the domain specific for DGAT,\n\nLPLAT and MGAT superfamily protein (Figure S1B).\n\nA set of specific forward and reverse primers (Table S2) was\n\ndesigned on the basis of this hypothetical DGAT2 homologous\n\nsequence. A DNA fragment of ,1.7 kb was amplified by PCR\nfrom the genomic DNA of the oleaginous strain C. tropicalis SY005\n\nthat was available to us. The amplicon was cloned into TA cloning\n\nvector (pTZ57R/T) with InsTAclone PCR Cloning Kit (Fermen-\n\ntas, India) using E. coli DH10B as the host (Figure S2). The insert\n\nDNAs from recombinant plasmids of few randomly selected clones\n\nwere sequenced.\n\nTwo Novel DGAT2 Genes of Candida tropicalis SY005\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e94472\n\n\n\nSemi-quantitative RT-PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from yeast cells grown on four\n\ndifferent nitrogen-stress conditions using RNA extraction kit\n\n(Qiagen, India) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA\n\nquantity was determined by O.D. reading at 260/280 nm in a\n\nspectrophotometer (Eppendorf Biospectrophotometer), and the\n\nquality of RNA was determined by observing the integrity of\n\nrRNA bands in 1.2% agarose gel. For RT-PCR analysis, a set of\n\nspecific primers was designed (Table S2) based upon the\n\nnucleotide sequence of the portion flanking the stretch of repeated\n\nglutamic acid residues of CtDGAT2 homologues to amplify this\n\nparticular part of the cDNA, as there is characteristic length-wise\n\ndifference of six nucleotides between the two homologues. The 1\nst\n\nstrand cDNA was synthesized by respective gene-specific reverse\n\nprimers with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription\n\nKits (Applied Biosystems) using 3 mg total RNA as template\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Preliminary optimiza-\n\ntion experiments were carried out to make the RT-PCR semi-\n\nquantitative. The exponential phase of PCR was detected between\n\n20 and 28 cycles (data not shown), and subsequently the PCR for\n\n24 cycles were carried out using the 1\nst\n\nstrand cDNA prepared\n\nfrom the total RNA extracted at four different nitrogen-stress\n\nconditions. The RT-PCR amplicons (80 bp- and 86 bp-specific\n\nfor CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b, respectively) were subjected to\n\nelectrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide gel and visualized under\n\nUV trans-illuminator following ethidium bromide staining.\n\nBioinformatics analyses\nMultiple sequence alignment was conducted using newly\n\nisolated two CtDGAT2 proteins along with reported DGAT2\n\nfrom other organisms by Jellyfish sequence analysis software\n\n(http://www.jellyfishsoftware.com/index.htm;jsessionid = 12AB6\n\n43BBE591CBD2D1124E79A274AD4.node2). Hydropathy profiles\n\nwere analyzed by Kyte-Doolittle method (http://gcat.davidson.\n\nedu/DGPB/kd/kyte-doolittle.htm) [28]. Putative functional mo-\n\ntifs present in the two isozymes were identified using PROSCAN\n\n(http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl?page = /\n\nNPSA/npsa_proscan.html), and transmembrane helices\n\nwere predicted using TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/\n\nservices/TMHMM/). The secondary structures of the two\n\nCtDGAT2 isozymes were predicted using phyre2 webserver\n\n(http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id = index).\n\nThree-dimensional structure of CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b\n\nwere developed using MODELLER 8v2 taking the crystal\n\nstructure of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from\n\nMethanocaldococcus jannaschii DSM 2661 (PDB ID: 3RHD) as the\n\ntemplate showing sequence identity of .35% with both isozymes\n\nrevealed by PSI-BLAST [29]. Energy minimization of the\n\nresulting model was carried out by Insight II program (version\n\n2000.1, 2000; Accelrys), and the best model was stereo-\n\nchemically evaluated by PROCHECK (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/\n\nthornton-srv/software/PROCHECK). All the pictorial repre-\n\nsentations were prepared using PyMol (http://www.pymol.org).\n\nPreparation of different mutated version of CtDGAT2\ngene constructs\n\nFive deletions, 2 replacements and 1 insertional mutation of the\n\nCtDGAT2b gene were prepared by PCR amplification using\n\nspecific set of forward and reverse primers (Table S2). The full\n\nlength CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b genes along with all the mutated\n\nversions of the CtDGAT2b gene were subcloned individually in the\n\npYES2 plasmid (Invitrogen) for subsequent transformation into\n\nthe S. cerevisiae quadruple mutant (QM) strain (described below).\n\nMoreover, the full length CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b genes and few\n\nselected mutated versions of CtDGAT2b gene were further\n\nsubcloned separately into pYES2/CT vector (Invitrogen) carrying\n\na C-terminal V5 epitope fused with 6XHis tag to study\n\nrecombinant protein expression in transformed QM cells of S.\n\ncerevisiae.\n\nStrains of S. cerevisiae used for transformation\nThe S. cerevisiae BY742 strain was used as the wild-type (WT)\n\nyeast. The quadruple mutant (QM) strain H1246 (MATD are1-\nD::HIS3, are2-D::LEU2, dga1-D::KanMX4, lro1-D::TRP1 ADE2)\nof S. cerevisiae has knockout mutations for the DGA1, LRO1,\n\nARE1 and ARE2 genes, and thus is defective in TAG and sterol\n\nbiosynthesis. This QM yeast strain (kindly provided by Dr. S.\n\nStymne, Scandinavian Biotechnology Research, Alnarp, Sweden)\n\nwas used as the host for heterologous expression of two CtDGAT2\n\nhomologous genes and all the mutated versions of CtDGAT2b\n\ngene. The QM yeast cells were transformed with either the control\n\n(non-recombinant) plasmid or recombinant plasmid carrying the\n\nrespective gene by the lithium acetate-PEG method using S.C.\n\nEasyComp transformation kit (Invitrogen) following the protocol\n\nprovided in the manual. The transformants were selected on plates\n\nlacking uracil and cultivated in yeast nitrogen base (YNB) with 2%\n\n(w/v) dextrose. Cells were then harvested, washed with water, and\n\ninoculated in induction medium, where dextrose was replaced by\n\n2% (w/v) galactose and 1% (w/v) raffinose to induce the transgene\n\nexpression.\n\nQualitative analysis of lipid\nFluorescence microscopic analyses of the Nile red-stained wild-\n\ntype (WT) yeast cells and transformed QM cells, harboring either\n\nthe pYES2 non-recombinant plasmid or recombinant plasmid\n\nwith the particular gene, were carried out to examine the presence\n\nof storage lipid in yeast cells as described previously [30], and the\n\nsamples were observed under laser-scanning confocal microscope\n\nwith 488 nm excitation and 585 nm emission filters (Fluo View\n\nFV1000 confocal microscope, Olympus). The standard chloro-\n\nform:methanol extraction procedure was followed for lipid\n\nextraction following Bligh and Dyer method [31] with slight\n\nmodification as described previously [27]. The neutral lipid\n\nfractions were resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC)\n\nfollowing the reported method [32] on Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck,\n\nGermany) in solvent system of petroleum ether:diethyl ether:glacial\n\nacetic acid (70:30:1, v/v), and identified by comparing with\n\nrespective standards.\n\nQuantitative estimation of total lipid\nBoth gravimetric measurement [31] and Nile red fluorescence\n\nassay [30,33] were performed to estimate lipid content of wild-type\n\ncells, QM cells and QM cells transformed with individual\n\nCtDGAT2 gene construct. Yeast cells were grown on induction\n\nmedium for 4 days, and biomass was harvested by filtration, and\n\nlyophilized to store at 270uC for future use.

After that, 95 ml cell suspension was\ntaken from each of the culture, and 5 ml Nile red stain was mixed\nwith it, and incubated in dark for 5 minutes. Cell suspension was\n\nwashed with PBS buffer and the fluorescence intensity was\n\nmeasured before and after addition of Nile red. The first\n\nmeasurement was subtracted from the second measurement, and\n\nthe results were divided by A600 nm with appropriate dilutions.\n\nBoth types of quantitative estimations were conducted with three\n\nindividual cultures for each set of experiments and with three\n\nreplicates.\n\nIn vivo fatty acid supplementation assay\nThe test for cytotoxic effect due to free oleic acid in growth\n\nmedium was carried out to understand the enzymatic fraction of\n\nCtDGAT2b following the method described before [25], with\n\nslight modification. Oleic acid was dissolved in ethanol at 0.5 M\n\nconcentration and later diluted in warm medium with non-ionic\n\nsurfactant Tween-80 (0.01%, v/v) immediately before yeast\n\ninoculation. Wild-type and QM cells were grown on YNB\n\nmedium with uracil (URA+) and 2% dextrose. On the contrary,\nthe QM strain containing either the non-recombinant pYES2\n\nplasmid or the recombinant plasmid with the CtDGAT2b gene\n\nwas grown in YNB without uracil (URA-) medium containing 1%\n\nraffinose and 2% galactose for the induced expression of the\n\ntransgene.

The FAME\n\nconversion of each neutral lipid fraction was checked by TLC\n\nalong with a standard FAME (data not shown). Finally, small\n\nvolume (3\u20135 ml) of the prepared FAME sample was analyzed by\ngas chromatography (PerkinElmer, Clarus 500), fitted with a flame\n\nionization detector and Omegawax-250 capillary column (30 m\n\nlength, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 mm film thickness,\nSigma). Identification and quantification of individual chromato-\n\ngraphic peaks were carried out by means of external standard\n\n(Supelco 37-Component FAME Mix, Sigma) and their corre-\n\nsponding calibration curves.\n\nSDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis\nTotal protein from transformed S. cerevisiae cells was isolated\n\nusing breaking buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM\n\nEDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF) followed by intermittent\n\nvortexing with acid-washed glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich, India). For\n\nimmunoblotting, representative protein samples of equal amount\n\nwere separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently electro-trans-\n\nferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then\n\nrocked for 2 h at room temperature in blocking solution [PBS\n\nbuffer supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 (v/v) and 2% BSA (w/\n\nv)]. Chromogenic detection was carried out with Opti-4CN kit\n\n(Bio-Rad) after incubating the membrane in appropriately diluted\n\nrespective primary antibody (1:4000 for mouse monoclonal anti-\n\nHis antibody) followed by corresponding secondary antibody\n\n(1:2000 for HRP conjugated anti-mouse, G Bioscience).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nIn our previous report, while characterizing an oleaginous yeast\n\nC. tropicalis SY005, differential regulations of two key genes i.e.,\n\nmalic enzyme and DGAT involved in lipid productivity were\n\ntested during four different nitrogen-stress conditions [27]. The\n\ninvestigation documented ,22 fold upregulation of the DGAT\ngene-specific transcript during maximum lipid production stage\n\ncorrelating to a specific nitrogen-stress with the C:N ratio of 150:1.\n\nFrom the transcript profiling data, it was hypothesized that\n\ndifferent homologues of DGAT gene in the C. tropicalis might be\n\nexpressed at different stages of its growth or life cycle, and\n\ndefinitely upregulated during specific nitrogen-stress condition for\n\nthe enhanced accumulation of storage lipid [27].\n\nDifferential expression of two DGAT2 gene homologues\nunder nitrogen-stress condition for enhanced storage\nlipid production in Candida tropicalis SY005 strain\n\nTo further understand our previous findings in detail, we cloned\n\nand sequenced DGAT-specific gene from this oleaginous yeast.\n\nSequence analysis of the newly cloned insert DNAs revealed the\n\npresence of two homologous genes of type-2 DGAT in this strain\n\nof C. tropicalis (Figure S3), designated as CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b\n\nwith the GenBank accession numbers KJ437597 and KJ437598,\n\nrespectively. The CtDGAT2a homologue showed 100% nucleotide\n\nsequence identity with the reported sequence [XP_002546731.1]\n\nof C. tropicalis MYA-3404 available in public database, whereas the\n\nCtDGAT2b is different in 21 nucleotides, resulting in alteration of 9\n\namino acids (Figure S3). To find out any differential expression of\n\nthe transcript corresponding to the two CtDGAT2 homologues at\n\nfour different nitrogen-stress conditions during enhanced storage\n\nlipid accumulation, RT-PCR was carried out. Analysis of RT-\n\nPCR amplicons showed that the expression of CtDGAT2a\n\nhomologue was detectable in all four stress conditions, gradually\n\nincreasing from C:N ratio of 50:1 to 200:1 (Figure 1A). On the\n\nother hand, the expression of CtDGAT2b isoform was found to be\n\npredominant in 150:1 (C:N) stress condition (Figure 1A), where the\n\nlipid accumulation was also observed to be maximum [27]. These\n\nresults indicated differential expression of two homologues of\n\nCtDGAT2 gene at different nitrogen-stress conditions correlated to\n\nthe enhanced production of storage lipid in C. tropicalis SY005\n\nstrain.\n\nIn the past, presence of more than one isoform of DGAT2 has\n\nbeen reported in microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, where five\n\ntype-2 DGAT homologous genes contribute towards TAG\n\nproduction [13]. Among the plants, although occurrence of\n\nDGAT2 gene has been reported in several species [6], two isoforms\n\nof DGAT2 have been documented so far in Arachis hypogaea [35].\n\nHowever, no other reports are available so far except the present\n\nstudy, where more than one homologue of DGAT2 gene has been\n\ncharacterized in fungus, especially in oleaginous yeast. Although,\n\ndetail genetics of C. tropicalis SY005 strain with respect to the\n\nCtDGAT2 gene has not been carried out, it is possible that the\n\nCtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b homologues could be two alleles of the\n\nsame gene.\n\nTwo Novel DGAT2 Genes of Candida tropicalis SY005\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e94472\n\n\n\nTwo Novel DGAT2 Genes of Candida tropicalis SY005\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e94472\n\n\n\nTwo isoforms- CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b are unique in\nprimary structure among the reported DGAT2s\n\nTo verify in silico the DGAT2-specific conserved motifs in the\n\nnewly cloned isoforms, the amino acid sequences of CtDGAT2a\n\nand CtDGAT2b were aligned with homologous sequences of\n\nDGAT2 obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mortierella ramanni-\n\nana, Arabidopsis thaliana, Vernicia fordii, and Caenorhabditis elegans using\n\nJellyfish sequence allignment software. Here five types of different\n\norganisms i.e., yeast, mold, model plant, tung tree and nematode\n\nwere considered as representative organism of species that are\n\nevolutionary diverged. Three regions with remarkable sequence\n\nconservation are observed amongst all the DGAT2 enzymes\n\n(Figure 1B). First, the motif YFP (\n129\n\nYFP\n131\n\nin ScDGAT2) is\n\ncompletely conserved (\n152\n\nYFP\n154\n\n) in the two CtDGAT2 isoforms.\n\nSecond, the motif HPHG (\n193\n\nHPHG\n196\n\nin ScDGAT2) is also\n\nconserved (\n234\n\nHPHG\n237\n\n) in the CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b\n\nisoforms. The third motif consisting of RXGFX(K/\n\nR)XAXXXGXXX(L/V)VPXXXFG(E/Q) spans the longest con-\n\nserved region in DGAT2-homologous proteins. This motif is\n\nfound in between the amino acid residues 288 and 311 in\n\nScDGAT2, 394 and 417 in CtDGAT2a, and 396 and 419 in\n\nCtDGAT2b. However in ScDGAT2, this motif is in close\n\nproximity to Cys\n314\n\nresidue, which has been previously demon-\n\nstrated to be the locus of N-ethylmaleimide-mediated enzyme\n\ninhibition. Even though the two CtDGAT2 isoforms are yeast\n\nderived, the Cys is replaced by corresponding Val\n420\n\nin\n\nCtDGAT2a and Val\n422\n\nin CtDGAT2b, analogous to the situation\n\nin DGAT2 of A. thaliana. It is noteworthy that a putative neutral\n\nlipid-binding domain, FLXLXXXn (where n is a nonpolar amino\n\nacid) commonly found in proteins of DGAT2 family including\n\nScDGAT2 (\n71\n\nFVLF\n74\n\n), is not present in the newly cloned two\n\nCtDGAT2 isoforms as well as in A. thaliana DGAT2. More\n\ninterestingly, compared to other reported DGAT2 proteins, there\n\nare five unique stretches of amino acids present in CtDGAT2a\n\nand CtDGAT2b, designated in this study as D1, D2, D3, D4 and\n\nD5 domains (Figure 1B), in addition to the conserved motifs\n\nmentioned earlier. A phylogenetic analysis using the amino acid\n\nsequences of DGAT2s revealed that the two CtDGAT2 isoforms\n\nare intimately related to one another and have close relationship to\n\nthe DGAT2 proteins from other species of yeasts and fungi, but\n\ndistantly related to that of other organisms (Figure S4).\n\nFurther in silico analysis was carried out to investigate the\n\npotential structural features of two CtDGAT2 isoforms by\n\ncomparing the hydropathy profile of DGAT2 proteins from S.\n\ncerevisiae and Vernicia fordii, where topological orientations were\n\nexperimentally tested [36]. The distributions of sequence motifs in\n\nC. tropicalis, S. cereviseae, and V. fordii DGAT2 proteins were\n\nanalyzed in Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plots [28]. Although the\n\nDGAT2 proteins of three organisms display apparently similar\n\nplots, there are characteristic differences (Figure 2). The N-\n\nterminal region of each protein contains a hydrophilic stretch\n\nfollowed by a hydrophobic region, except that the hydrophilic tail\n\nin VfDGAT2 is significantly shorter. The ScDGAT2 has a\n\ncontinuous sequence of mostly hydrophobic amino acids between\n\n192\nnd\n\nand 250\nth\n\nresidues (Figure 2), which contains the conserved\n\nmotif HPHG (Figure 1B); in contrast, neither of the CtDGAT2\n\nisoform has continuous hydrophobicity in similar region (Figure 2)\n\nbut HPHG motif is present within both (Figure 1B). Interestingly,\n\nboth the CtDGAT2 isoforms have other two exclusive hydrophilic\n\nregions between residues 250-300 and 350-400 (highlighted by\n\ngreen boxes D3 and D4, respectively in Figure 2), which are not\n\npresent in DGAT proteins of other two organisms.\n\nCtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b are characteristically different\nin amino acid sequences and at the predicted secondary\nand tertiary protein structure\n\nThe derived polypeptide sequences of two newly cloned gene\n\nhomologues- CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b were analyzed in details\n\nusing bioinformatics tools to find out any differences between\n\nthese two at the level of primary, secondary and tertiary\n\nprotein structure. PROSCAN (http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/\n\nnpsa_automat.pl?page = /NPSA/npsa_proscan.html) programme\n\nidentified five putative functional motifs, and two of these display\n\ndifferences between CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b with respect to\n\nthe position as well as amino acid composition (Table S1).\n\nAnalysis of the predicted secondary protein structures using\n\nphyre2 program (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/\n\npage.cgi?id = index) revealed the existence of differences between\n\nthe two isoforms at several positions of a-helices and b-sheets\nthroughout the length of the proteins (Figure 3A). The membrane\n\ntopology distribution of CtDGAT2a and CtDGAt2b isoforms was\n\nevaluated, showing almost the same predicted internal structures.\n\nUsing TMHMM (TMHMM Server v. 2.0), we identified one\n\npotential transmembrane helix at the amino acid position 91\u2013113\n\n(Figure S5), suggesting that these proteins are located in the\n\nmembrane system. Interestingly, the CtDGAT2b isoform indicates\n\na higher probability of the presence of yet another transmembrane\n\nregion between the residue numbers of 220\u2013300 compared to\n\nCtDGAT2a (Figure S5).\n\nThrough analysis of the predicted 3-D structures of both\n\nCtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b, four striking differences were clearly\n\nvisible in the structural overlap of the two models (Figure 3B). Two\n\nextra large side chain loops are observed in CtDGAT2a, formed\n\nby residues 425\u2013435 and 365\u2013375 as indicated by A and D,\n\nrespectively. On the contrary, a prominently large side chain loop\n\nis formed in CtDGAT2b due to residues 385\u2013430 as indicated by\n\nB. Moreover, there is a slight difference between the two isoforms\n\nin the orientation of one a-helix that is indicated at the position C,\ncomprising the amino acid residues 450\u2013500 (Figure 3B).\n\nSince two CtDGAT2 isoforms are unique in amino acid\n\nsequence compared to the reported DGAT2 proteins, particularly\n\nwith respect to the five additional domains D1 to D5, we\n\nFigure 1.

Moreover, on the basis of the significant\n\ndifferences in the predicted primary, secondary and tertiary\n\nprotein structures, we also hypothesized that the two isoforms of\n\nCtDGAT2 might have different physiological functions in vivo.\n\nHence we constructed two recombinant vectors of pYES2 using\n\nCtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b genes, and studied the heterologous\n\nexpression of these two isoforms in neutral lipid-deficient\n\nquadruple mutant S. cerevisiae H1246 strain to establish their\n\nbiochemical functions.\n\nBoth the isoforms are functionally active, and the\nCtDGAT2b isozyme is catalytically more efficient than\nCtDGAT2a for storage lipid production in heterologous\nyeast system\n\nYeast cells usually accumulate TAG and sterol esters during\n\nstationary phase of growth in cytosolic lipid bodies [37]. The\n\nmutant S. cerevisiae H1246 strain, which lacks the genes essential for\n\nthe formation of TAG (DGAT and PDAT genes) and sterol esters\n\n(ARE1 and ARE2 genes), does not form these lipid bodies. Since\n\nthe activity of at least one of these four genes is sufficient to restore\n\nthe formation of lipid bodies, we wanted to determine whether\n\nlipid bodies could be established in this mutant strain upon\n\nexpression of the full length CtDGAT2 isoforms.\n\nThe transformed S. cerevisiae cells harboring the recombinant\n\npYES2 with either CtDGAT2a or CtDGAT2b gene were induced\n\nusing galactose, the total protein samples were harvested, and\n\nverified through western blotting. Analysis revealed that the two\n\nrecombinant proteins i.e., the full length CtDGAT2a and\n\nCtDGAT2b of predicted molecular mass ,63kDa gave positive\nsignals on western blot (Figure 4A), confirming the presence of\n\nheterologously expressed protein after 6 h of induction. This time\n\nperiod was found to be the optimal incubation time for induction\n\nof the recombinant CtDGAT2 proteins in transformed yeast cells.\n\nLipid-specific fluorescent dye Nile red was used to visualize\n\nmicroscopically the presence of lipid bodies in S. cerevisiae wild-type\n\n(WT), quadruple mutant (QM) cells transformed with the non-\n\nrecombinant plasmid pYES2 and QM cells expressing either\n\nCtDGAT2a or CtDGAT2b. The emission maximum of Nile red\n\nconjugated with neutral lipids differs from that of the dye-polar\n\nlipid complex. Moreover, the intensity of fluorescence caused by\n\nthe interaction of the dye with neutral lipid is much higher than\n\nthat with polar lipid, making Nile red suitable for our purpose of\n\nqualitative assessment.\n\nAs expected, lipid bodies were detected in the wild-type S.\n\ncerevisiae cells, but absent from the QM strain harboring only the\n\ncontrol plasmid (Figure 4B). However, expression of either\n\nCtDGAT2a or CtDGAT2b in QM cells successfully restored the\n\nability to form the neutral lipid bodies (Figure 4B), reflecting the\n\nfunctional activities of both CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b enzymes\n\nto interact with the S. cerevisiae lipid metabolic pathway. Following\n\nexpression, total lipid extracts from the transformed and non-\n\ntransformed yeast cells were prepared, and then subjected to thin\n\nlayer chromatography. Analysis revealed that the TAG could not\n\nbe detected in QM yeast cells lacking the endogenous DGAT and\n\nPDAT activity, whereas the wild-type cells having both the\n\nendogenous genes accumulated normal level of TAG as usual\n\n(Figure 4C).

Lipid-specific Nile red dye moves\n\nfreely across cellular membrane and thus makes it possible to\n\nperform the quantitative neutral lipid assay in living cells,\n\neliminating the need for sample preparation. Moreover, Siloto et\n\nal. have proved that the DGAT activity can be quantified by Nile\n\nred fluorescence spectrometry assay, which is comparable with the\n\nstandard in vitro radioactive assay [34].\n\nTherefore, we also used this simple and reliable fluorescence\n\nspectrometry assay after staining with Nile red to quantify the\n\namount of TAG that accumulated in the S. cerevisiae wild-type cells,\n\nQM cells transformed with the control plasmid pYES2 and QM\n\ncells expressing either CtDGAT2a or CtDGAT2b. The fluores-\n\ncence increase (DF) of QM cells expressing each CtDGAT2\nisozyme was found to be significantly more than wild-type S.\n\ncerevisiae cells and extremely high compared to the QM cells\n\nharboring the non-recombinant plasmid without the gene of\n\ninterest (Figure 4D). Estimation showed that the accumulation of\n\nTAG is 12.5% more in the QM cells transformed with the\n\nCtDGAT2b gene compared to that with the CtDGAT2a gene.\n\nTherefore, the finding elucidated that the isozyme CtDGAT2b is\n\ncatalytically superior and capable of producing more storage lipid\n\nthan the CtDGAT2a isozyme.\n\nPreviously, the functions of DGAT2 enzymes from three\n\nmicroalgae species, Ostreococcus tauri, Thalassiosira pseudonana and\n\nPhaeodactylum tricornatum have been confirmed by restoring the\n\nTAG biosynthesis in this neutral lipid-deficient quadruple mutant\n\nstrain H1246 of S. cerevisiae [38,39,32]. Among the plants, activities\n\nof Brassica napus DGAT1 and Tropaeolum majus DGAT1 have also\n\nbeen characterized by using the same strain [34,40].\n\nThe CtDGAT2b is capable of incorporating exogenous\nfatty acids in TAG, and is having preferential saturated\nfatty acid specificity in heterologous yeast expression\nsystem\n\nThe DGAT enzyme can carry out the metabolic channeling of\n\nexogenous or unusual fatty acid into TAG, besides incorporating\n\nthe normal cellular fatty acids into the later. Wild-type S. cerevisiae\n\ncells grow normally without any growth defect in the presence of\n\nunsaturated fatty acids, especially when free oleic acid is in the\n\nmedium. However, the yeast neutral lipid-deficient QM cells with\n\nor without the non-recombinant plasmid exhibit a growth defect in\n\nthe medium containing free fatty acids. To test whether the\n\nCtDGAT2b isozyme is equally efficient in rescuing yeast cells from\n\nfree fatty acid toxicity, the QM cells transformed with either the\n\nnon-recombinant or recombinant plasmid carrying the CtDGAT2b\n\ngene and wild-type cells without any plasmid were grown in media\n\ndevoid of any free fatty acid or containing oleic acid of different\n\nconcentrations. In media lacking free fatty acids, both wild-type\n\nand QM cells exhibited normal growth, but the QM strain started\n\nshowing cytotoxic effect with the addition of 0.025 mM oleic acid\n\nin the medium (Figure 5A). When the concentration of oleic acid\n\nin the medium increased to 0.5 mM, the growth of QM cells was\n\narrested due to toxicity, but wild-type yeast cells continued to grow\n\nwith little cytotoxic effect. However, upon overexpression of the\n\nCtDGAT2b enzyme, the growth of QM cells was rescued at the\n\ncritical oleic acid concentration, which was found to be toxic to the\n\nQM cells with or without the non-recombinant plasmid\n\n(Figure 5A).\n\nIt is known that lipid bodies are present in the wild-type S.\n\ncerevisiae cells, and completely absent in the QM strain. To assess\n\nwhether the cells rescued from free fatty acid toxicity actually form\n\nlipid bodies, QM cells transformed with the non-recombinant\n\nplasmid or recombinant plasmid carrying the CtDGAT2b gene\n\nwere visualized by confocal microscopy after Nile red staining.\n\nThe analysis revealed cytoplasmic lipid droplet formation in QM\n\ncells transformed with the recombinant plasmid, but no such lipid\n\nbodies were found in cells transformed with the non-recombinant\n\nplasmid (data not shown). From these findings, it is evident that the\n\nCtDGAT2b isozyme is efficient in mobilizing the free fatty acid\n\npool into storage lipids.\n\nTo find out whether other unsaturated fatty acids, besides oleic\n\nacid could be incorporated into TAG of QM yeast cells upon\n\nexpression of the CtDGAT2b, we compared growth phenotype of\n\nQM cells transformed with the non-recombinant plasmid and\n\nthose with the recombinant plasmid carrying the CtDGAT2b gene\n\non solid media supplemented with different fatty acids, like a-\nlinolenic acid (ALA), arachidonic acid (ARA) and erucic acid (EA).\n\nAfter 4 days of incubation at 30uC on solid media, it was revealed\nthat QM cells transformed with the CtDGAT2b gene grew\n\nsuccessfully on solid media supplemented with different fatty acids\n\nthan QM cells without the gene of interest (Figure 5B).\n\nTo verify any preference for specific fatty acid to incorporate\n\ninto TAG by acyltransferase activity of CtDGAT2b, the QM cells\n\nwith the gene and the wild-type cells without the gene were grown\n\nin liquid media supplemented with or without the above\n\nmentioned three exogenous fatty acids i.e., ALA, ARA and EA\n\nas these are not naturally present in yeast cells. In the absence of\n\nsupplementary fatty acid, the recombinant CtDGAT2b formed\n\nTAG by utilizing endogenous fatty acids, and showed a clear\n\npreference for saturated C16:0 and C18:0 fatty acids as compared\n\nto the endogenous ScDGAT of wild-type yeast, which was more\n\nselective towards monounsaturated C16:1 and C18:1 acyl species\n\n[Figure 5C (i)]. Thus, TAGs formed by the activity of CtDGAT2b\n\nare substantially more saturated than those formed by the wild-\n\ntype ScDGAT. In three fatty acid supplementary experiments, the\n\nsame trend of endogenous fatty acid utilization specificity was\n\nobserved for TAG formation by both the recombinant\n\nCtDGAT2b and the wild-type ScDGAT. With respect to the\n\nexogenous fatty acid utilization, the wild-type ScDGAT showed\n\nmore preference towards supplemented ALA during TAG\n\nformtaion compared to the recombinant CtDGAT2b yeast cell\n\n[Figure 5C (ii)], whereas the opposite selectivity was observed in\n\ncase of ARA or EA supplementation [Figure 5C (iii, iv)].\n\nFew reports documented on the substrate specificity of DGAT2\n\nenzymes in the past [6]. The V. fordii DGAT2 showed preferential\n\nincorporation of a-eleostearic acid in TAGs of seed [17]. On the\ncontrary, the DGAT2 enzyme of castor bean and Vernonia\n\ngalamensis displayed higher selectivity for substrates containing\n\nricinoleic and vernolic acid, respectively [18,41]. Among the fungi,\n\nthe Mortierella ramanniana DGAT2 showed enhanced activity\n\ntowards medium-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, like myristoyl-CoA [42],\n\nwhereas the DGAT2 of yeast S. pombe was found to prefer palmitic\n\nacid over oleic acid [43]. In our present study, we observed that\n\nthe CtDGAT2b has substrate selectivity more towards saturated\n\nthan unsaturated acyl species in heterologous yeast expression\n\nsystem. This has definite correlation to our earlier report and well\n\njustifies the fact that the oleaginous C. tropicalis natural isolate\n\nSY005 is capable of producing storage lipid enriched with\n\nsaturated fatty acids, particularly stearic acid.\n\nTwo Novel DGAT2 Genes of Candida tropicalis SY005\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e94472\n\n\n\nLipid productivity efficiency of CtDGAT2b in\nheterologous yeast system is affected by deletion,\ninsertion or replacement of amino acids in five exclusive\nregions other than the highly conserved DGAT-specific\nmotifs\n\nSince two CtDGAT2 isoforms are unique with respect to the\n\npresence of five additional stretches of amino acids i.e., D1 to D5\n\ncompared to other reported DGAT2 proteins (Figure 1B),\n\nmutagenesis analyses were carried out within these domains to\n\nunderstand the detailed functions of these novel acyltransferases.\n\nAmong the two functionally active isozymes, since the CtDGAT2b\n\nis capable of yielding more TAG compared to CtDGAT2a in\n\nheterologous expression system, the former was selected as\n\ncandidate gene for in-depth analysis. For this investigation,\n\ninitially 5 deletion genetic constructs were prepared in addition\n\nto the full length CtDGAT2b isoform. Subsequently one more\n\ndeletion, one insertional and two replacement mutant gene\n\nconstructs were prepared.\n\nFirstly, to verify whether the 5 deleted gene constructs\n\n(Figure 6A, B) do indeed encode a protein with DGAT activity,\n\ntransformed QM cells were grown as usual to check for cell\n\nmorphology and induced by galactose to observe for the\n\nexpression of recombinant protein. Analysis revealed that the 5\n\ndeleted gene constructs i.e., DD1, DD2, DD3, DD4 and DD5 along\nwith the full length CtDGAT2b upon transformation into QM\n\nyeast cells showed no alteration in cell growth morphology\n\n(Figure 6C), and resulted in the expression of expected size\n\nrecombinant protein, as depicted for few samples (Figure 7C).\n\nSubsequently, formation of lipid bodies in transformed QM cells\n\nwas monitored through Nile red staining followed by confocal\n\nmicroscopy (Figure 7A). Among the five deleted constructs tested,\n\ntrace amounts of TAGs were detected in the QM cells expressing\n\nthe deleted genes DD1(1\u201321), DD4(341\u2013384) and DD5(481\u2013571);\nwhereas those expressing DD2(170\u2013187) and DD3(252\u2013271)\nvariants showed significant amount of TAGs inside the cells\n\n(Figure7A).\n\nFurther, to quantify the differential lipid accumulation, total\n\nlipid extracts from transformants were analyzed by thin layer\n\nchromatography (Figure 7B), and lipid contents were estimated by\n\nNile red fluorescence spectrometry assay (Figure 7E). Analyses\n\nrevealed that the deletion of D1 segment of amino acids (1\u201321) at\n\nthe N-terminal region of the protein, resulted in an enzyme with\n\nless than 64% of activity compared to the full length CtDGAT2b\n\nas reflected by TAG content of transformed cells (Figure 7E).\n\nAmong the other segments, D2(170\u2013187) and D3(252\u2013271), being\n\nlocated in the middle region displayed a little decrease of enzyme\n\nactivity ,34% and ,23% respectively, in TAG accumulation\ncompared to the CtDGAT2b. On the other hand, the deletions of\n\nthe segment D4(341\u2013384) located in the middle region and the\n\nsegment D5(481\u2013571) situated at the C terminal region of protein\n\nresulted very significant decreases in enzyme activity, as reflected\n\nby 76% and 88% decrease in TAG accumulation, respectively\n\ncompared to the full length CtDGAT2b (Figure 7D). These\n\nfindings indicate that the hydrophilic regions at the middle and C-\n\nterminal tail of CtDGAT2 are more sensitive to any alteration\n\nthan N-terminus in terms of enzyme activity. Another interesting\n\ninference from these results is that the deleted segment D4(341\u2013\n\n384), being located in the middle part of the CtDGAT2b with\n\nthree predicted phosphorylation sites (Table S1) and carrying an\n\nunique glutamic acid stretch of 10 residues could play a critical\n\nrole in enzyme activity. To further verify the importance of this\n\nrepeat of glutamate, we created yet another deleted gene construct\n\nDD6(365\u2013374) to exclude this repeat of gutamic acids (Figure 7D).\n\nFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of CtDGAT2b in S. cerevisiae QM strain rescues the yeast cells from the cytotoxic effect due to free fatty\nacid in growth medium. (A) Growth rescue of transformed QM cells in oleic acid containing media. Yeast nitrogen base media was used for the\ngrowth of wild-type (WT) and non-transformed QM cells with dextrose and uracil, whereas raffinose and galactose with no uracil was used for the QM\ntransformant (QM-pYES2 or QM-CtDGAT2b) to induce the expression of transgene. Two microliters of yeast cells (O.D. 1), after serial dilutions (1021,\n10\n\n22\n, 10\n\n23\n, 10\n\n24\nand 10\n\n25\n) were spotted on solid media without or with 0.025 mM and 0.5 M oleic acid. (B) Growth phenotype of QM cells harboring\n\nnon-recombinant plasmid pYES2 (QM-pYES2) and recombinant plasmid with the CtDGAT2b gene (QM-CtDGAT2b) on solid media supplemented with\nthree different fatty acids- a-linoleic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4), erucic acid (C22:1) after 4 days at 30uC. (C) Fatty acid composition of TAGs\nisolated from the wild-type yeast (WT) and transformed QM cells (QM-CtDGAT2b) grown in liquid media (i) without any free fatty acid, and\nsupplemented with (ii) a-linolenic acid (ALA), (iii) arachidonic acid (ARA) and (iv) erucic acid (EA).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0094472.g005\n\nTwo Novel DGAT2 Genes of Candida tropicalis SY005\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e94472\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the deletion mutant DD6(365\u2013374) resulted a similar\ndecrease of about ,70% in enzyme activity (Figure 7E) compared\nto the full length CtDGAT2b, implying that the whole D4(341\u2013\n\n384) segment is not accountable for the critical enzyme activity,\n\nrather a specific deca-glutamic acid stretch is more imperative, and\n\nthis repeat sequence has positive effect on the enzyme activity. As\n\nmentioned earlier that the CtDGAT2b is capable of yielding\n\n12.5% more TAG compared to the CtDGAT2a isozyme in QM\n\nyeast cells (Figure 4) and it naturally possesses a repeat of 10\n\nglutamic acids compared to that of eight glutamic acids in\n\nCtDGAT2a exactly in the same position of the polypeptide\n\n(Figure 1B). In the context of these findings, we hypothesized that\n\nthe insertion of extra glutamic acids in this region might have\n\nmore positive effect on the enzyme activity. Thus, we incorporated\n\nadditional two glutamic acids in CtDAT2b to make a stretch of\n\ntwelve glutamic acids in this region from residue 365 to 376 at\n\nposition 364, creating one insertional gene variant, D7(364::365\u2013\n\n376) (Figure 7D). Surprisingly, this insertional mutant showed an\n\nincrease of more than 40% in enzyme activity compared to the full\n\nlength CtDGAT2b (Figure 7E), resulting in the creation of a\n\nhyperactive mutant version of CtDGAT2.\n\nTo examine further whether this enhanced acyltransferase\n\nactivity of CtDGAT2b is specific to only negatively charged amino\n\nacid repeat in this position, we inserted a stretch of 10 lysine (K), a\n\npositively charged amino acid in place of negatively charged\n\nglutamic acid (E) at the same position to make the first\n\nreplacement gene variant, D8(364::KKKKKKKKKK)\n\n(Figure 7D). In contrast to D7 variant, this mutant D8 resulted a\n\ndecrease in enzyme activity of about ,80% compared to the wild-\n\ntype CtDGAT2b (Figure 7E), suggesting the augmentation effect\n\non the enzymatic activity in D7 variant was sequence specific to\n\nglutamic amino acids. We had also replaced the naturally\n\noccurring 10 glutamic acids in CtDGAT2b by 10 residues of\n\nalanine (A), a nonpolar and nonreactive amino acid that doesn\u2019t\n\ngenerally play major role in protein function, at the same position\n\n(Figure 7D). In comparison to D7 and D8, this second\n\nreplacement gene mutant D9(364::AAAAAAAAAA) caused\n\n,40% decrease in the activity of enzyme with respect to the full\nlength CtDGAT2b (Figure 7E).\n\nPreviously, site-directed mutagenesis on the conserved motifs of\n\nS. cerevisiae DGAT2 revealed the functional role of this enzyme and\n\ntopological orientation of the DGAT2-specific signature motifs\n\n[33]. Similar kind of studies carried out on the signature motifs of\n\nS. cerevisiae DGAT1 demonstrated that the mutagenesis of His-426\n\nto alanine impaired the ability of DGAT1 to synthesize\n\ntriacylglycerols [44]. Among the plant species, mutagenesis\n\nexperiment was conducted on the signature regions putatively\n\ninvolved in enzyme function or regulation of DGAT1 of\n\nTropaeolum majus [40].\n\nThe present mutagenesis study for the first time provides\n\nevidence that the additional non-conserved domains are very\n\ncrucial in the regulation of DGAT2 enzyme, besides the highly\n\nconserved DGAT-specific motifs. Recognizing the essential role of\n\nhighly conserved DGAT2-specific motifs, we have documented\n\nthat the additional five domains (D1 to D5) of CtDGAT2 play vital\n\nfunction in influencing the acyltransferase activity in the C.\n\ntropicalis SY005 strain for neutral lipid production. More impor-\n\ntantly, the unique stretch of 10 negatively charged glutamic acid\n\nFigure 6.

Additionally, a hyperactive version of\n\nCtDGAT2 enzyme with 12 glutamic acid residues has been\n\ndeveloped and tested during the course of this study, in contrast to\n\nthe naturally existing CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b having eight\n\nand 10 glutamic acid residues, respectively.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have cloned and functionally characterized two novel\n\nhomologues of DGAT2 gene from the oleaginous yeast C. tropicalis\n\nSY005 strain, which is a natural producer of enhanced storage\n\nlipid enriched with saturated fatty acids, particularly stearate. The\n\ntwo isozymes- CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b open up the scope for\n\nfurther investigation on the novel structure-function relationship in\n\nthe repertoire of DGAT enzymes. It is worthy to mention here\n\nthat the C. tropicalis SY005, which we have studied, is a natural\n\nisolate from the rhizospheric soil; but the pathogenic yeast C.\n\nalbicans is responsible for the fungal disease, known as candidiasis\n\nin animals including human. Therefore, we are tempting to\n\nspeculate that similar kind of structurally novel DGAT2 enzyme(s)\n\nmay be present in the pathogenic yeasts or fungi, and could be the\n\ntarget to design drug molecules to selectively inactivate the TAG\n\nproduction, leading to the blockage in the life cycle of this\n\norganism. Additionally, the newly cloned CtDGAT2b gene or its\n\nhyperactive mutant version will be useful for the enhanced\n\nFigure 7.
