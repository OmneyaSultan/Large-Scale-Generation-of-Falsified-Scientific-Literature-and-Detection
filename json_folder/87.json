Based on phenotypic results, PCR sequencing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blotting,\nthe isolate was assigned to E. faecium with a chromosomally located VanD allele most closely related to the\nVanD1 allele.\n\nGlycopeptides inhibit cell wall synthesis through the inter-\naction of their N termini with the D-alanyl-D-alanine termini of\npeptidoglycan precursors. The resulting complexes prevent the\ntransglycosylases from incorporating disaccharide pentapep-\ntide subunits into the growing peptidoglycan chain, thereby\ninhibiting cell wall synthesis (15). Since 1988, many reports\ndescribed the increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococci\nfrom Europe and the United States (6, 13). This resistance to\nglycopeptides occurs via a common mechanism involving mod-\nification of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway (8). Five\nphenotypes of acquired glycopeptide resistance have been\nidentified in enterococci. VanA and VanB are the most com-\nmon types. They are caused by complex gene clusters that may\nbe plasmid and/or transposon carried (8). VanE and VanG\ntypes have each been identified in single strains of Enterococ-\ncus faecalis (11, 15). Finally, to date, five Enterococcus faecium\nstrains with VanD resistance have been reported in the United\nStates, in Canada, and in Brazil (4, 7, 16, 18, 19). These isolates\nwere recovered from stool cultures, urine, and blood cultures\nfrom immunocompromised patients. Each contained a distinct\nvanD allele, vanD1 to vanD5 (4, 7, 16, 18, 19).\n\nSince November 2003, a 56-year-old man had been regularly\nadmitted to the hematology and oncology unit of N\u0131\u0302mes Uni-\nversity Hospital for the treatment of an acute myeloid leuke-\nmia. He was hospitalized on February 2004 for febrile neutro-\npenia. Physical examination did not reveal a focal site of\ninfection. E. faecium was isolated from three blood cultures.\nDespite an intravenous antibiotic therapy using levofloxacin\nand quinupristin/dalfopristin, the patient died 5 days after his\nadmission.\n\nE. faecium was determined biochemically using the Vitek\n2-AST N017 identification card (Biomerieux, Marcy-l\u2019Etoile,\n\nFrance). Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined with the\nE-test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on blood agar\nplates, and antibiotic MICs were interpreted according to the\nrecommendations of the Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing\nCommittee of the French Society for Microbiology with En-\nterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecium B91 (VanA\ufffd), and\nE. faecium B132 (VanB\ufffd) as reference strains (20). The three\nisolates from the blood cultures showed the same resistant\npattern. They were resistant to penicillin G (MIC, 16 \ufffdg/ml),\ngentamicin (MIC, \ufffd2,000 \ufffdg/ml), streptomycin (MIC, \ufffd2,000\n\ufffdg/ml), tetracycline (MIC, 16 \ufffdg/ml), linezolid (MIC, \ufffd4 \ufffdg/\nml), daptomycin (MIC, 16 \ufffdg/ml), and macrolide-lincosamide-\nstreptogramin B-type antibiotics (MIC, \ufffd8 \ufffdg/ml). They were\nalso resistant to vancomycin (MIC, \ufffd256 \ufffdg/ml) and teicopla-\nnin (MIC, \ufffd256 \ufffdg/ml). They were susceptible only to quinu-\npristin/dalfopristin (MIC, 0.5 \ufffdg/ml) and intermediate to levo-\nfloxacin (MIC, 2 \ufffdg/ml). Levels of growth of these strains in\nthe absence of and following the addition of vancomycin (8\n\ufffdg/ml) were identical (data not shown), indicating that resis-\ntance was expressed constitutively. One of the three isolates\nwas genotypically studied and named E. faecium NEF1.\n\nTo determine the genotype responsible for the unusual re-\nsistance of this strain, we used a multiplex PCR assay previ-\nously described by Dutka-Malen et al., which allows simulta-\nneous detection of the glycopeptide resistance genotypes vanA\nand vanB, which encode D-alanine-D-lactate (D-Ala-D-Lac) li-\ngases, and vanC-1 and vanC-2/3, which encode D-Ala-D-Ser\nligases (9). At the same time, multiplex PCR allows the iden-\ntification to the species level of the following clinically relevant\nenterococci: E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. gallinarum, and E. cas-\nseliflavus/E. flavescens. In this assay, PCR amplicons are dis-\ncriminated from each other based on their molecular sizes.\nThis protocol was modified according to Patel et al. in order to\nbypass the DNA extraction procedure and to process the PCR\nassay directly on an isolated colony from blood agar or Muel-\nler-Hinton plates (17).

Mul-\ntiplex PCR performed on the enterococcal isolate resistant to\nvancomycin and teicoplanin yielded a 550-bp amplified frag-\nment specific for an internal fragment of the gene encoding\nD-Ala-D-Ala ligase of E. faecium. However, despite the high\nlevel of resistance to glycopeptides of this E. faecium isolate,\nnone of the vanA, vanB, vanC1, or vanC2/3 resistance deter-\nminants could be amplified. Using degenerate V3 (5\ufffd-GAR\nGAT GGI TSC ATM CAR GGW-3\ufffd) and V4 (5\ufffd-MGT RAA\nICC IGG CAK RGT RTT-3\ufffd) primers, which allow amplifica-\ntion of fragments internal to genes encoding related ligases\n(12), we obtained a 630-bp fragment. This fragment was cloned\n\ninto pGEMT (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield the pGEMT-\nVan plasmid and introduced into Escherichia coli via transfor-\nmation. The insert was sequenced. The deduced 223-amino-\nacid partial peptide showed approximately 90% identity with\nfive VanD ligases listed in the GenBank database. Primer walk\nsequencing was carried out to amplify the entire D-Ala-D-Lac\nligase (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Deduced amino\nacid sequences were aligned using ClustalW (http://www.ebi\n.ac.uk/clustalw/). The complete region detected was predicted\nto encode a ligase of 343 amino acids (Fig. 1). This VanD\npeptide showed 85 to 95% amino acid identity to the VanD2\n(AF153050 [16]), VanD3 (AF175293 [3]), VanD4 (AF277571\n[7]), and VanD5 (AAR37060 [2]) ligases and 68% and 67%\nidentity with, respectively, the VanA and VanB (B1 and B2)\nligases (M97297 [1], U35369 [10], and AY145441 [14]) (Table\n1). It shared a maximum of 98% amino acid identity with the\nVanD1 ligase (AF130997 [5]).\n\nTo search for a possible chromosomal location of the vanD\nallele, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of I-CeuI-re-\nstricted DNA as previously described (2). A transfer of DNA\nfrom electrophoresis gel to a nylon membrane was accom-\nplished by capillary transfer. For DNA probing of the Southern\nblot, we used an amplification product obtained by PCR of E.\nfaecium NEF1 using the vanD1 primers previously described\n(18). This product was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP follow-\ning the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Boehringer Mannheim,\nIndianapolis, Ind.) and hybridized on I-CeuI-restricted pat-\nterns (Fig. 2). The vanD1 probe hybridized with E. faecium\nNEF1 DNA, confirming the chromosomal localization of this\nresistance gene as previously described for the vanD1 gene\n(18). All these results point to the fact that the resistance gene\nin E. faecium NEF1 is most closely related to the vanD1 allele.\n\nIn this study, we reported to the best of our knowledge the\nfirst strain of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium from Europe\nthat contains a vanD allele. Since this episode of bacteremia,\nno further strains belonging to this genotype have been iso-\nlated in our hospital. Similar to previous patients reported with\nVanD-type glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus, this patient\n\nFIG. 1.

For a few months, our patient had been treated several\ntimes with vancomycin, but, during this period, the patient had\nno enterococcal infections. He received also \ufffd-lactams (amoxi-\ncillin plus clavulanic acid, imipenem, and cephalosporins),\nfluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and pristinamycin. How-\never, he did not have any links with the United States, Canada,\nor Brazil, the countries where the five VanD-type glycopep-\ntide-resistant E. faecium strains have been previously de-\nscribed. Interestingly, the five E. faecium strains with VanD-\ntype resistance reported before were isolated in patients with\nmultiple medical problems: diabetes mellitus, aplastic anemia,\nand, above all, three cases of orthoptic liver transplantation.\n\nPhenotypically, this E. faecium presents a very high level of\nresistance against teicoplanin compared with the other de-\nscribed vanD phenotypes. It may represent constitutive high-\nlevel expression of the vanD gene cluster. The resistance gene\nin E. faecium NEF1 is most closely related to the VanD1 allele.\nThe E. faecium NEF1 peptide showed 98% amino acid identity\nto the VanD1 ligases and a vanD1 probe hybridized with the E.\nfaecium NEF1 DNA. The residues believed to comprise the\nactive site of VanA are conserved in all enterococcal D-Ala-D-\nAla ligases, including our isolate (7) (Fig. 1). It will be inter-\nesting to characterize the entire vanD operon in E. faecium\nNEF1 to detect potential variations in its organization com-\npared to vanD1 to vanD5 operons.\n\nWe showed that the vanD gene of our isolate was chromo-\nsomally located as previously described for the other VanD\nisolates (8). This distribution may contribute to the paucity of\nVanD-type resistant strains in contrast to the widespread and\nincreasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci car-\nrying vanA or vanB genes in France.\n\n(This work was presented in part in 6th European Congress\nof Chemotherapy and Infections, Paris, France, December\n2004, abstr. 348/78P.)\n\nWe are very grateful to Josiane Campos for performing the entero-\ncoccal multiplex PCR assay.\n\nThis work was supported by Universite\u0301 de Montpellier 1 (BQR, BQ\n68).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
