It is known that autoantibodies can enter viable cells and this\nphenomenon has functional consequences including activation of apoptotic process. The objective of this work was to explore whether autoan-\ntibodies contained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera trigger apoptotic process in an experimental model represented by the human salivary gland\ncell line A-253. To define if the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways are activated, we examined which caspases are critical for inducing cell death.\nThe results have demonstrated that morphological changes and DNA laddering, consistent with apoptotic cell death, occurred in A-253 cells\ntreated with IgG from Sjo\u0308gren sera. Sjo\u0308gren IgG induced cleavage and activation of the effector caspase-3 and degradation of the caspase-3\nsubstrate poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated, since both caspase-8 and caspase-9\ncleavages occurred. In conclusion, autoantibodies contained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera mediate apoptosis of the A-253 cell line in a\ncaspase-dependent manner.\n\ufffd 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

S syndrome is an autoimmune rheumatic disease\nthat targets salivary and lachrymal glands, leading to glandu-\nlar atrophy characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and\nxerostomia [7e9]. SS may occur alone, defined as primary\nSS, or in association with other autoimmune diseases, such\nas rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\nor scleroderma, when it is defined as secondary SS [10].\n\nAlthough there is a high correlation between the pres-\nence of serum autoantibodies and the development of SS,\nit is still unclear why cellular components, participating\n\nmailto:m.sisto@anatomia.uniba.it\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/08968411\n\n\n39M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\nin important biosynthetic and structural functions, are tar-\ngeted for autoimmune reactions, and the exact role of these\nantibodies in the pathogenesis of the disease is uncertain.\n\nThe association of apoptosis with autoantibodies produc-\ntion is of recent interest, in fact numerous diseases of definite\nor possible autoimmune aetiology have lately been shown to\ndisplay abnormalities in apoptosis [11]. Apoptosis or pro-\ngrammed cell death (PCD) is a physiological process that as-\nsures cellular exchange; this natural machinery eliminates the\napoptotic material present in blebs and apoptotic bodies [12].\nStudies performed over the last years have demonstrated that\nthe caspases, a family of cysteine-dependent, aspartate-\ndirected proteases, play a critical role in the initiation and\nexecution of apoptosis [13]. Caspases are synthesized as\ninactive zymogens that become activated by cleavage via\nupstream proteases and, once activated, lead to cell death\nvia two distinct caspase-dependent pathways. The first\ninvolves the death receptor, or extrinsic pathway, which is\ninitiated by TNF-receptor family members and involves the\nactivation of initiator caspase-8 and/or caspase-10. The alter-\nnative intrinsic pathway, dependent on Fas and various cell\nstress stimuli, triggers the cell death process via mitochon-\ndrial release of Cytochrome c and the activation of initiator\ncaspase-9. The active forms of caspase-8 and caspase-9\ncleave and activate the downstream effectors caspase-3,\ncaspase-6, and caspase-7 [14e16]. Once activated, caspases\ncleave a variety of intracellular polypeptides of cytoplasmic\nand nuclear localization, such as poly(ADP-ribose)polymer-\nase (PARP) and these scissions disrupt survival pathways\nand disassemble architectural components of the cell, contrib-\nuting to the morphological and biochemical changes that\ncharacterize apoptotic cell death. Data in literature have dem-\nonstrated that in autoimmune conditions the caspases are over\nactivated [17] and the tolerance is broken by different factors,\nincluding an inappropriate removal of apoptotic material.\nThis impairment promotes an antigen-driven response against\nintracellular antigens [18]. In the past few years, the expres-\nsion of the apoptosis-regulating protein in the salivary glands\nof SS patients has been reported, suggesting a role for apo-\nptotic cell death in the pathogenesis of glandular damage in\nthis autoimmune disease [19]. Several authors have demon-\nstrated that in SS there is an increased apoptosis of salivary\ngland epithelium, together with the expression of Fas and\nFasL, suggesting the induction of PCD through a classic\nFaseFasL interaction [17]. In addition, in SS the glandular\nepithelium is increasingly sensitive to apoptosis, in contrast\nto the resistance to PCD exhibited by the infiltrating glandu-\nlar lymphocytes [17,20]. At present, the mechanisms underly-\ning the glandular tissue destruction observed in SS patients\nare not fully understood. Our goal in this research was to\ndemonstrate that, in an experimental model represented by\nthe human salivary gland cell line A-253, autoantibodies con-\ntained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera directed against cel-\nlular antigens trigger the apoptotic process. In addition, by\nexamining which caspases are critical for inducing cell death,\nwe show that both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic path-\nways are activated.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. A-253 cell culture\n\nA-253 cells from human epidermoid carcinoma of the sub-\nmaxillary gland (American Type Culture Collection, number:\nHTB-41) were cultured in McCoy\u2019s 5a modified medium\n(GIBCO, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bo-\nvine serum (FBS; SIGMA, MO, USA), 1% (v/v) antibiotic so-\nlution (100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin)\n(SIGMA), 2 mM L-glutamine (SIGMA) and incubated in a\nhumidified 5% CO2e95% air incubator at 37\n\n\ufffdC.\n\n2.2. Patients and controls\n\nSera were obtained from nine healthy volunteers and nine\npatients with primary Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome, all fulfilling the\nAmericaneEuropean Consensus Group Classification criteria\nfor SS [1]. None of the patients examined met the clinical or\nserological criteria for additional connective tissue disease.\nNone of the patients suffered from acute viral or bacterial in-\nfections at the time of the study. Informed consent for studies\ninvolving human subjects was obtained and the studies were\nconducted according to the tenets of the Declaration of\nHelsinki.\n\n2.3. Preparation and purification of human IgG\n\nIgG was obtained from Sjo\u0308gren and healthy sera by precip-\nitation with ammonium sulphate at 50% (w/v), followed by\nthree washes in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and repreci-\npitation with 33% (w/v) ammonium sulphate. The resulting\nprecipitate was submitted to dialysis against phosphate buffer,\npH 7.4, at 4 \ufffdC overnight. Subsequently, IgG was purified on\nprotein G Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden)\nas recommended by the manufacturer. The IgG containing\neluates, spectrophotometrically evaluated (l\u00bc 280), were\nconcentrated to 20 mg/ml.\n\n2.4. ELISA autoantibodies\u2019 tests\n\nThe nine Sjo\u0308gren and healthy sera, processed to obtain IgG\nfractions, were chosen submitting them to indirect solid phase\nenzyme immunoassays to detect autoantibodies against nu-\nclear protein SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La) (ENA combi, ELISA\nkit, DIAMEDIX, FL, USA), autoantibodies against nuclear\nantigens SSA-52 (Ro 52), SSA-60 (Ro 60), SSB (La), RNP/\nSm, RNP-70 Kd, RNP-A, RNP-C, Sm-BB0, Sm-D, Sm-E,\nSm-F, Sm-G, Scl-70, Jo-1, dsDNA, ssDNA, poly-nucleosome,\nmono-nucleosome, histone-complex, Histone H1, Histone\nH2A, Histone H2B, Histone H3, Histone H4, PM-Scl-100,\nCentromere B (ANA Detect ELISA kit, DIAMEDIX, FL,\nUSA), and autoantibodies directed against the cytoskeletal\nprotein a-fodrin (Anti-Alpha Fodrin detection kit, DIAME-\nDIX). Briefly, prediluted controls and patient samples were\nplaced in microtiter plates precoated with the above-\nmentioned antigens. After 30 min incubation at room\n\n\n\n40 M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\ntemperature, an HRP-conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin\nG was added to each well to detect specific autoantibodies con-\ntained in the control and patient sera. The same bioassay was\nused for the detection of autoantibodies in the control and patient\nIgG fractions. The colorimetric reaction was performed using\ntetramethylbenzidine, a chromogenic substrate oxidised by\nHRP. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the\noptical density was measured at 450 nm with an automated\nmicroplate reader. The amount of colour was directly propor-\ntional to the concentration of autoantibodies present in samples.\n\n2.5. Internalization of autoantibody by\nimmunofluorescence\n\nThe internalization of SS IgG by A-253 cells was studied\nby fluorescence microscopy. The A-253 cells (1\ufffd 106 cells/\nwell) were distributed in well microculture plates (Nunc, Den-\nmark) in which a 175-mm cellocate glass (Eppendorf, Ger-\nmany) had been previously placed. The cells were incubated\nwith SS IgG (200 mg/ml) at 37 \ufffdC for 2 h. After washing\nwith PBS, the cells were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformalde-\nhyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v)\nTriton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The fixed cells were then in-\ncubated with goat anti-human IgG-FITC antibody (sc-2456;\n1:200; from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) at room\ntemperature for 40 min. Intracellular IgG were observed under\na fluorescence microscope. To confirm the internalization of\nautoantibodies cells were pretreated for 2 h with cytochalasin\nD (15 mg/ml) and then treated with SS IgG for 2 h at 37 \ufffdC.\nHealthy IgG were used as control.\n\n2.6. A-253 cell treatment\n\nTo evaluate the apoptosis, cell cultures were subjected to\ndifferent treatments as follows: (1) treatment with IgG fractions\n(200 mg/ml) purified from healthy sera (H IgG) for 48 h; (2)\ntreatment with IgG fractions (200 mg/ml) purified from Sjo\u0308gren\nsera (SS IgG) for 48 h; (3) treatment with IgG (200 mg/ml) pu-\nrified from healthy sera for 48 h after pre-incubation for 2 h\nwith cytochalasin D (SIGMA) (15 mg/ml) an agent disrupting\ncytoskeletal filaments; and (4) treatment for 48 h with IgG pu-\nrified from Sjo\u0308gren sera (200 mg/ml) after pre-incubation for\n2 h with cytochalasin D (15 mg/ml). Controls included both un-\ntreated cells and cells incubated for 48 h with the pro-apoptotic\nagent actinomycin D (SIGMA) (5 mg/ml).\n\n2.7. Determination of apoptosis\n\n2.7.1. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of A-253\ncell apoptosis\n\nTo detect apoptotic cells, the Vibrant Apoptosis assay kit\n(Molecular Probes, Inc., OR, USA) was employed. This assay\nuses the green fluorescent non-permeant nuclear dye YO-\nPRO-1 that is able to enter apoptotic cells and propidium\niodide (PI), that stains necrotic cells. After incubation on ice\nfor 20 min, the cells were immediately observed under fluores-\ncence microscopy using a green reference filter (l\u00bc 490 nm)\nfor YO-PRO-1 and a red reference filter (l\u00bc 530 nm) for PI.\nApoptotic cells appear green-stained, necrotic cells appear\nred-stained, viable cells show little or no fluorescence. To de-\ntermine the optimum concentration of Sjo\u0308gren IgG to employ\nin the experimental procedure, the same YO-PRO-1 assay was\nused. The A-253 cells were treated with growing concentra-\ntions of SS IgG (10, 50, 100, and 200 mg/ml) for 48 h. The\nA-253 cells treated with the same concentrations of healthy\nIgG were used as control. The percentage of apoptotic cells\nwas determined by counting at least 100 cells.\n\n2.7.2. DNA fragmentation of A-253 cell line\nDegradation of the A-253 cell line DNA was used as an in-\n\ndex of apoptosis. A-253 (107) cells from each treatment were\nwashed in PBS and lysed in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA,\n1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice. Then 1 ml of DNA-\nzol (Molecular Research Center Inc., OH, USA) was added to\ncells in the presence of proteinase K (100 mg/ml) for 30 min at\n37 \ufffdC. After centrifugation at 11 000\ufffd g for 20 min at 10 \ufffdC,\nthe supernatant was collected and RNAse A (20 mg/ml) was\nadded for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC, in order to eliminate contaminating\nRNA. The DNA extracted was precipitated in 100% (v/v) eth-\nanol and centrifuged at 11 000\ufffd g for 20 min. Purified DNA\nwas dissolved in 8 mM NaOH, separated by electrophoresis\nin a 2% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide\nstaining.\n\n2.7.3. Caspase-3 activation analysis\nActive caspase-3 enzyme is a heterodimer composed of two\n\n17 kDa and two 11 kDa subunits derived from a 32-kDa pro-\nenzyme (pro-caspase-3) by cleavage at multiple aspartic acid\nsites. The caspase-3 precursor is firstly cleaved to produce\nthe p11 subunit and the 20 kDa (p20) peptide. Subsequently,\nthe p20 peptide is cleaved to generate the mature p17 subunit\n[21]. We adopted two different approaches to visualize the\nintracellular activation of caspase-3 during the apoptotic\nprocess, immunofluorescence and enzymatic assays. In the\nimmunofluorescence assay, treated A-253 cells were fixed\nfor 10 min in 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde diluted in PBS plus\n0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. After treatment with 0.2% (w/v) bo-\nvine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 10 min to minimize\nnon-specific absorption of antibodies, the coverslips were in-\ncubated, for 45 min at room temperature, with the rabbit\nanti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (pAb; 80806E; 1:1500;\nPharmingen, Germany), specific for the 17 kDa subunit, and\nfor 30 min with the bovine anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (sc-2365;\n1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Finally, the slides were\nmounted and examined under a fluorescence microscope.\n\nThe enzymatic activity of caspase-3 in lysates of A-253\ncells was evaluated using the CaspACE\ufffd colorimetric assay\nsystem (Promega Corporation, WI, USA). This assay is based\non the recognition of specific amino acid sequences by\ncaspase-3 and the proteolytic cleavage of DEVD-pNA by\ncaspase-3 into the chromophore p-nitroanline ( p-NA). Briefly,\nA-253 cells, treated as described in Section 2.6, were har-\nvested, washed twice in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then lysed\nwith a cell lysis buffer, according to the manufacturer\u2019s\n\n\n\n41M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\ninstructions. The amount of total proteins extracted was quan-\ntified by Bradford\u2019s method [22] and equal amounts (50 mg) of\nproteins from the total cell lysate were used in the assay. Pro-\ntein lysates were transferred to a flat-bottomed microtitre plate\nand the reaction buffer plus the caspase-3 substrate DEVD (N-\nacetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde)-pNA were added. After 4 h\nof incubation at 37 \ufffdC, the caspase-3 activity was detected by\nmeasurement of the free p-nitroaniline ( p-Na), released by\ncleavage of the substrate, in an absorbance spectrophotometer\nat 405 nm. To assess the specificity of the reaction, the com-\npetitive inhibitor of caspase-3, Z-VAD-FMK [valylalanylas-\npartic acid (VAD) fluoromethyl ketone (FMK), 20 mM] was\nadded to the samples. The results are expressed as mean\ufffd SE\nof nine experiments performed in duplicate.\n\n2.7.4. Determination of caspases-8 and caspase-9\nenzymatic activity\n\nTo distinguish between the two major pathways of caspase\nactivation possibly induced by autoantibodies from Sjo\u0308gren\nsera, we evaluated caspases-8 and caspase-9 activity in A-\n253 cells submitted to the treatments as indicated above.\nThe caspase-8 and caspase-9 colorimetric protease assay kits\n(BioSource International Inc., CA, USA) were used.\n\nCaspase-8, involved in the extrinsic pathway of caspase\nactivation, exists in cells as a 55-kDa proprotein which is\nactivated to produce p18/p17 subunits. The caspase-8 precur-\nsor is firstly cleaved to produce the p17 subunit and the p20\npeptide. Subsequently, the p20 peptide is cleaved to generate\nthe mature p18 subunit. Caspase-9, activated in the intrinsic\npathway of programmed cell death, exists in cells as an inac-\ntive 46 kDa proenzyme which is cleaved to active 35 and\n10 kDa subunits [21]. The kits are able to assay the amount\nof active caspase-8, that recognizes the IETD (Ile-Glu-Thr-\nAsp) amino acid sequence, and the amount of active cas-\npase-9 that recognizes the LEHD (Leu-Glu-His-Asp) amino\nacid sequence. These amino acid sequences correspond to\ncleavage sites of the inactive 32 kDa caspase-3 precursor.\nThe tests include a substrate for active caspase-8, IETD-\npNA, composed of the chromophore p-nitroaniline ( p-NA)\nand a synthetic tetrapeptide IETD, and a substrate for active\ncaspase-9, LEHD-pNA, composed of the chromophore p-ni-\ntroaniline ( p-NA) and a synthetic tetrapeptide LEHD. Briefly,\ntreated cells (5\ufffd 106) were lysed with 50 ml of the cell lysis\nbuffer, followed by freezing and thawing cycles. For the assay,\n100 mg of protein lysates was mixed with caspase assay\nbuffers in a 96-well microtiter plate. Then, IETD-pNA or\nLEHD-pNA substrates were added to the wells and the micro-\nplate was incubated at 37 \ufffdC for 2 h in the dark. Upon cleav-\nage of the substrate by active caspase-8 or caspase-9, free p-\nNA light absorbance was quantified using a microplate reader\nat l\u00bc 405 nm. Comparison of the absorbance of p-NA from\napoptotic samples or control samples allowed the determina-\ntion of caspase-8 and caspase-9 activity.\n\n2.7.5. Western blot analysis\nThe total cellular content of active caspase-3, caspase-8,\n\ncaspase-9 and of the substrate of active caspase-3, PARP,\nwas analysed by western blot. A-253 cells, treated as in Sec-\ntion 2.6, were washed twice, detached with ice-cold PBS, col-\nlected and centrifuged at 600\ufffd g for 10 min. The supernatant\nwas removed and the pellet was incubated with lysis buffer\n[1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mM TriseHCl, 137 mM NaCl,\n10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsul-\nfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 mM leupeptin hemisulfate salt,\nand 0.2 U/ml aprotinin] for 30 min on ice. After incubation,\nthe obtained lysate was vortexed and then centrifuged at\n12 800\ufffd g for 10 min; the protein concentration in the super-\nnatant was spectrophotometrically determined by Bradford\u2019s\nprotein assay, and the lysate was subjected to sodium dodecyl\nsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Pro-\ntein samples were diluted with sample buffer (0.5 M TriseHCl\npH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10% w/v SDS, 5%(v/v) b2-mer-\ncaptoethanol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and then\nboiled for 3 min. Proteins (25 mg/lane) and prestained stan-\ndards (BioRad Laboratories, CA, USA) were loaded on 10%\n(PARP) or 15% (all proteins except PARP) SDS-polyacryl-\namide precast gels. All the experiments were carried out in du-\nplicate. After electrophoresis, the resolved proteins were\ntransferred from gel onto nitrocellulose membranes. A blot\nbuffer [20 mM Tris/150 mM glycine, pH 8, 20% (v/v) metha-\nnol] was used for gel and membrane saturation and blot. The\nblot conditions were the following: 200 mA (constant amper-\nage), 200 V for 110 min. After the transfer to nitrocellulose,\nequal loading of each lane was confirmed by Ponceau S stain-\ning. Blots were then blocked by PBS, pH 7.2, with 0.1% (v/v)\nTween-20, 5% w/v non-fat dried milk for 1 h and washed\nthree times with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20ePBS 1\ufffd (TePBS).\nMembranes were then incubated for 90 min with goat anti-\ncaspase-3 pAb (sc-1225; 1:500), rabbit anti-PARP pAb\n(sc-7150; 1:500), rabbit anti-caspase-9 (sc-8355; 1:200), rabbit\nanti-caspase-8 (sc-7890; 1:500); all pAbs from Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology.

Morphological analysis of apoptotic A-253 cells\n\nFor analysis of the nuclear morphology, A-253 cells,\nstained with the Vybrant Apoptosis assay kit, were observed\nunder fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3, the per-\ncentage of apoptotic A-253 cells treated with IgG purified\nfrom Sjo\u0308gren sera (78.9\ufffd 0.7) was significantly higher\n( p< 0.01) than the percentage of apoptotic cells observed in\nuntreated control cells (1.2\ufffd 0.1). No significant difference\n( p> 0.05) was revealed between the percentage of apoptotic\nA-253 cells treated with IgG purified from healthy sera\n(1.3\ufffd 0.1) and control cells (1.2\ufffd 0.1).\n\n3.5. IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera induce DNA\nfragmentation\n\nDNA fragmentation analysis in A-253 cells treated as de-\nscribed in Section 2 yielded these results: DNA fragmentation\nwas observed in cells treated with the pro-apoptotic agent ac-\ntinomycin D, as in cells treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren\nsera. Moreover, SS IgG-induced DNA fragmentation was pre-\nvented by preliminary treatment with cytochalasin D. No DNA\nfragmentation was observed in untreated control cells and in\ncells treated with IgG purified from healthy donors (Fig. 4).\n\n3.6. IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera induce caspase-3\nactivation\n\nIn the immunofluorescence assay, the cells in which\ncaspase-3 was activated appeared green-stained.

Untreated cells (lane C)\nand cells treated with actinomycin D (lane Act) were used as control. The\n\nmolecular weight standard was run in lane M.

A-253 untreated control cells (A) and cells treated with IgG purified from healthy donors sera (C) did not show intracellular caspase-3 ac-\n\ntivation. Actinomycin D-treated A-253 cells (B) and cells treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera (D) showed intracellular activation of caspase-3 (in the\n\nfigure, green-stained cells appear white). Scale bar\u00bc 10 mm. The results are representative of nine experiments.\n(Fig. 5B) and in cells treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren\nsera (Fig. 5D). By contrast, A-253 untreated control cells\n(Fig. 5A) and cells treated with IgG purified from healthy\nsera (Fig. 5C) did not show intracellular caspase-3 activation.\nMoreover, pretreatment with cytochalasin D prevented\ncaspase-3 activation induced by SS IgG cell treatment (data\nnot shown).\n\nFig. 6 shows the active caspase-3 proteolytic activity mea-\nsured by the CaspACE\ufffd colorimetric assay system. A signif-\nicantly higher ( p< 0.01) caspase-3 enzymatic activity was\nobserved in A-253 cells treated with IgG from Sjo\u0308gren sera\nin comparison with untreated control cells. No significant dif-\nferences in caspase-3 activity were observed between A-253\ncells treated with IgG from healthy sera and untreated control\nsera ( p> 0.05). A significant ( p< 0.01) reduction in caspase-\n3 enzymatic activity was observed when A-253 cells were\npretreated with cytochalasin D and then with SS IgG in com-\nparison with cells treated with SS IgG alone. The specificity\nof the reaction, assessed using the competitive inhibitor of\ncaspase-3, Z-VAD-FMK was reliable because treatment with\nthis substance blocked DEVD-pNA cleavage (data not\nshown).\n3.7. IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera induce activation of\nboth caspase-8 and caspase-9\n\nFig. 7 shows the active caspase-8 (Fig. 7A) and the active\ncaspase-9 (Fig. 7B) proteolytic activity measured by the\ncaspase-8 and caspase-9 colorimetric protease assay kits. A-253\ncells treatment with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera led to\nthe activation of both of these caspases, involved in different\napoptotic pathways. In fact, a significantly higher ( p< 0.01)\ncaspase-8 enzymatic activity was observed in IgG from\nSjo\u0308gren sera-treated A-253 cells in comparison with untreated\ncontrol cells. No significant differences in caspase-8 activity\nwere observed between A-253 cells treated with IgG from\nhealthy sera and untreated control sera ( p> 0.05). A signifi-\ncant ( p< 0.01) reduction in caspase-8 enzymatic activity\nwas observed when A-253 cells were treated with cytochalasin\nD plus SS IgG, in comparison with cells treated with SS IgG\nalone. The same results were observed for caspase-9 activa-\ntion, in fact, SS IgG treatment of A-253 cell line led to the ac-\ntivation of caspase-9, and the enzymatic activity of caspase-9\nwas significantly higher ( p< 0.01) than in untreated control\ncells and cells treated with H IgG. Moreover, caspase-9\n\n\n\n45M.

IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera induce proteolytic\ncleavage of initiator and executor caspases\n\nCleavage of the initiator caspases-8 and caspase-9 and of\nthe effector caspase-3 and active caspase-3 substrate, PARP,\nwas analysed by western blot. Western blot analysis of\ncaspase-3 protein activation was performed using the anti-\ncaspase-3 antibody, specific for peptide mapping at the\nC-terminus of the caspase-3 subunit p20, as a probe. The\nantibody recognizes both the caspase-3 precursor and\nthe active caspase-3 subunit p20. The presence of the\n20 kDa band was evaluated in A-253 untreated control cells\nand in cells treated with actinomycin D, IgG purified from\nSjo\u0308gren sera, and IgG purified from healthy sera. The band\ncorresponding to the p20 subunit detected in actinomycin\nD-treated cells was evident in SS IgG-treated cells as well.\nOnly the caspase-3 precursor was detectable in untreated con-\ntrol cells and in cells treated with H IgG (Fig. 8 panel A). To\nconfirm caspase-3 activation, the expression of the 89 kDa\nfragment of PARP, resulting from cleavage of endogenous\n116 kDa PARP by active caspase-3, was analysed. In A-253\ncontrol cells and in cells treated with IgG from healthy do-\nnors, the full length 116 kDa PARP was expressed. Treatment\nof A-253 with actinomycin D and with IgG from Sjo\u0308gren\npatients induced the cleavage of the full length PARP in the\n89 kDa subunit (Fig. 8 panel B). Western blot analysis of\nthe caspase-8 protein activation was performed using the\nanti-caspase-8 antibody, specific for the p20 subunit, which\nis able to recognize both the inactive pro-caspase-8 and the\nactive p20 fragment. Pro-caspase-9 cleavage was revealed\nusing the anti-caspase-9 antibody, specific for the p35 active\nsubunit. As shown in Fig. 9, SS IgG treatment induced\npro-caspase-8 (Fig. 9 panel A) and pro-caspase-9 (Fig. 9 panel\n\ncaspase-3 assay\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nC Act H IgG SS IgG H IgG+\nCyt D\n\nSS IgG+\nCyt D \n\nc\na\ns\np\n\na\ns\ne\n-\n3\n \na\nc\nt\ni\nv\ni\nt\ny\n\nFig. 6.

Discussion\n\nThis study was undertaken to determine whether autoanti-\nbodies against several antigens contained in IgG purified\nfrom Sjo\u0308gren sera trigger apoptosis in human salivary gland\ncell line A-253. Our findings demonstrate that in A-253 cells\nautoantibodies induce (1) the activation of both the intrinsic\nand the extrinsic apoptotic pathways; (2) then the cleavage\nand activation of effector caspase-3; and, finally, (3) morpho-\nlogical changes typical of apoptosis. On the contrary, IgG\npurified from healthy sera have no effects on A-253 cells.\n\nThe ability of some autoantibodies to enter viable cells and\nreact with cellular antigens is accepted from several authors.\nIn varying experimental models, both in vitro and in vivo, it\n\nA\n\nB\n\ncaspase-8 assay\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nC Act H IgG SS IgG H IgG+\nCyt D\n\nSS IgG+\nCyt D\n\nc\na\ns\np\n\na\ns\ne\n-\n8\n \na\nc\nt\ni\nv\ni\nt\ny\n\ncaspase-9 assay\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nC Act H IgG SS IgG H IgG+\nCyt D\n\nSS IgG+\nCyt D\n\nc\na\ns\np\n\na\ns\ne\n-\n9\n \na\nc\nt\ni\nv\ni\nt\ny\n\nFig. 7.

Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\nhas been proven that antibodies to intracellular constituents\ncan enter living cell types from many tissues, causing various\nfunctional alterations [23e36]. Autoantibodies that penetrate\nlive cells include polyclonal and monoclonal anti-DNA\n[24,37e39], anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) [23,40], anti-Ro\n[41,42], anti-La [43], anti-proteinase 3 [44], anti-synaptosomal\n[45], anti-neuronal [46,47], anti-ribosomal protein P [48], and\nanti-a-fodrin [49], a gene protein product of recent identifica-\ntion. In particular, it has been reported that polyclonal IgG\nanti-RNP isolated from autoimmune patients penetrate live hu-\nman peripheral blood mononuclear cells [40,23], keratinocytes\n[50] and epithelial cells [38]. Furthermore, human polyclonal\nanti-DNA IgG isolated from systemic lupus erythematosus\nserum penetrate and localize in the cell nucleus of peripheral\nblood T lymphocytes [28,51,52], human and murine renal\ntubular cells [53].\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been investigated for the penetra-\ntion of autoantibodies [23,53e55]; it has been proposed that\ndifferent antibodies may preferentially use distinct penetration\npathways [27,53], including the engagement of Fc receptors\non cells, originally described by Alarco\u0301n-Segovia et al. [23],\nor the cross-reaction of antibodies with proteins located on\nor near the cell surface such as myosin 1, a 110-kDa cell sur-\nface receptor, in the case of monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies\n[56e58].\n\nSeveral findings suggest that there is a relationship between\nthe binding and penetration of autoantibodies into different\ncell types and the initiation of events leading to various func-\ntional cellular alterations. Autoantibodies can thereby modify\ncell functions, arrest the progression of the cell cycle and ab-\nrogate the expression of some genes [33]. One of the most in-\nteresting effects of autoantibody penetration is the induction of\nprogrammed cell death [24,28,35,46,47].\n\nFig. 8. Proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in A-253 cells. Cell lysates\n\nof A-253 cells were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE (15% for caspase-3\n\nand 10% for PARP) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for west-\n\nern blot analysis. Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies for caspase-3\n\n(panel A), PARP (panel B) and b-actin (panel C). Act, actinomycin D-treated\n\ncells; C, untreated control cells; H IgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from\n\nhealthy sera; SS IgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera.\n\nGrowing evidence suggests that the deregulation of apopto-\n\nsis is involved in autoimmunity. Autoimmune diseases are\ncharacterized by aberrations in the repertoire of lymphocytes\nthat infiltrate target organs in response to autoantigens arising\nfrom inappropriate apoptosis of target cells [59]. Often, the\npresence of autoreactive lymphocytes is involved in the pro-\ngression of the autoimmune diseases triggered by autoanti-\nbodies\u2019 penetration [60e62]. Numerous investigations have\nfocused on the role of CD95/Fas in organ-specific autoimmu-\nnity as shown in Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis [63], Grave\u2019s disease\n[64], insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [65] and systemic\nlupus erythematosus [66]. In SLE there is evidence of an\nincrease of the soluble Fas mediator, that would inhibit the\napoptotic process, but this feedback is not absolutely decisive\nfor autoimmune cell survival, because a high level of lympho-\ncyte apoptosis was concurrently found [67].\n\nRecently, research advances have supported the idea that,\nonce they have penetrated cells, autoantibodies can be directly\npathogenic and directly trigger the apoptotic pathway, depend-\ning on their antigen specificity [68]. Shiraga and Adamus\nshowed that anti-retinal autoantibodies of the paraneoplastic\nretinopathy syndrome, specific to recoverin and to enolase,\nbut not normal antibodies, can induce activation of the apopto-\ntic process via the intrinsic pathway in living retinal cells [69].\nFurthermore, DNA-specific autoantibodies can enter cultured\nmesangial cells [70], endothelial cells [71], and lymphoid cells\n[33], causing apoptosis.\n\nApoptosis also seems to play a central role in the pathogen-\nesis of Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome. S syndrome has been demon-\nstrated to proceed along two pathological phases: an early\nphase in which the salivary and lachrymal tissues undergo in-\nappropriate PCD and a later phase of lymphocyte infiltration\nand autoimmune aggression, in which further progressive\nglandular destruction and functional disability occur [72].\n\nFig. 9. Proteolytic cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9 in A-253 cells. Cell\n\nlysates of A-253 cells were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE (15%) and\n\ntransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for western blot analysis.

Act, actinomycin D-treated cells; C, untreated\n\ncontrol cells; H IgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from healthy sera; SS\n\nIgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera.\n\n\n\n47M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\nApoptotic death in SS may be mediated through the tumor ne-\ncrosis factor-alpha receptor [73], CD95 [74,75] or the perforin\npathway [3]. Recent observations have detected increased pro-\nteolytic activity in salivary epithelial cells, including that of\nthe caspases, enzymes involved in the intracellular PCD, sup-\nporting the concept that excessive cell death contributes to the\npathogenesis of this disease [76].\n\nAt present, in Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome, there are no evidences\nof any correlation between autoantibody penetration of sali-\nvary epithelial cells and a direct role in causing apoptosis. In\nthis report, we demonstrate that, in our experimental model\nrepresented by a human salivary gland cell line A-253, autoan-\ntibodies contained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera, once\npenetrated into cells, are able to trigger cell death through\napoptotic mechanisms.\n\nUsing YO-PRO-1 staining, we observed morphological\nchanges consistent with apoptotic cell death in A-253 cells\ntreated with SS IgG. DNA fragmentation into variable length\noligonucleosomal fragments is one of the typical features of\napoptosis. Characteristic DNA laddering, observed in A-253\ncells treated with SS IgG, confirmed cellular apoptosis. Inhibi-\ntion of autoantibody internalization, by blocking endocytosis\nusing cytochalasin D, an agent that disrupts cytoskeletal fila-\nments, conserved the DNA integrity. In addition, to distinguish\nbetween the two major pathways of caspase activation, we\nevaluated caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 proteolytic\ncleavage and activation in A-253 cells treated with SS IgG.\nIn A-253 cells, the treatment with SS IgG-induced cleavage\nand activation of effector caspase-3, a key and pivotal execu-\ntioner protease, confirmed by cleavage of caspase-3 substrate\npoly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) that is cleaved and inac-\ntivated when caspase-3 is activated. Colorimetric and western\nblot analyses demonstrated that both the intrinsic and extrinsic\npathways were activated, since both caspase-8 and caspase-9\ncleavage occurred. Pretreatment of A-253 cells with cytocha-\nlasin D inhibited caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 cleavage\nand activation, confirming that this effect was caused by auto-\nantibody penetration. In the same experimental condition, IgG\npurified from sera of healthy donors did not have the apoptotic\neffect that SS IgG had.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that autoantibodies contained\nin IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera mediate apoptosis of a sali-\nvary gland cell line in a caspase-dependent manner, in which\nboth the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways play a role. This may\nbe an important step towards finding more appropriate mea-\nsures for the treatment of Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome.
