Phagocytic activity of naive RAW macro-\nphages was increased either by recombinant mouse (rm) TNF-a or by culture supernatant from 10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW macro-\nphages. This phagocytic activity was inhibited by addition of anti-rmTNF-a polyclonal antibody (pAb). 10t\u201312c CLA also increased\nthe level of PPARc protein and mRNA in RAW macrophages. When naive RAW macrophages were incubated with the culture super-\nnatant from RAW macrophages treated with 10t\u201312c CLA plus GW 9662, a PPARc antagonist, their phagocytic activity was signifi-\ncantly inhibited. In addition, GW 9662 antagonized the effect of 10t\u201312c CLA in stimulating TNF-a expression. These results suggest\nthat 10t\u201312c CLA modulates the phagocytic activity of RAW macrophages by upregulating TNF-a expression via a PPARc-dependent\npathway.\n\ufffd 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yang).\nas a regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipid\nmetabolism and is found in various cell types [3,4].\nPPARc is activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids\n(PUFAs), the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabetic\ndrugs, a variety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\nand endogenous ligands such as 15-deoxy-D12,14-PGJ2\n(15d-PGJ2) [5,6]. 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone, PPARc\nagonists, inhibit phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA)-induced\nproduction of interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and tumor necro-\nsis factor (TNF)-a in peripheral blood monocytes [7].\nHowever, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, also PPARc\nagonists, did not inhibit phorbol ester-induced TNF-a\n\nmailto:mpyang@chungbuk.ac.kr\n\n\n228 D.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227\u2013235\nrelease from human monocytic THP-1 cells [8]. This PPARc\nmay regulate inflammatory and immune responses by\nmodulating the activity of monocytes or macrophages.\n\nDietary fatty acids such as linoleic acid and arachidonic\nacid may act as PPARc ligands to modulate lipid metabo-\nlism and suppress carcinogenesis, cytokine production,\nacute inflammation, and lymphocyte proliferation [9\u201311].\nConjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a class of positional\nand geometric isomers of linoleic acid with conjugated\ndouble bonds ranging from 6,8 to 12,14 [12,13]. CLA\nhas shown a wide range of biologically beneficial effects\nsuch as anti-adipogenic activity, including reduction of\nbody fat and lowering cholesterol level, and anti-diabeto-\ngenic, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-atherosclerotic activity\n[14\u201316]. CLA can stimulate or inhibit immune cell func-\ntions. CLA increased TNF-a and IL-6 secretion and\ndecreased IL-4 secretion by splenocytes [17] and reduced\nIL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a production by macrophages [18].\nCLA modulates expression of genes regulated by PPARc\nin muscle and activates PPARc in vitro [19]. In addition,\nexpression of PPARc is enhanced in CLA-fed pigs [20].\nIn contrast, CLA down-regulates expression of PPARc,\nas well as its target genes, fatty acid binding protein and\nliver X receptor a in adipocytes [13]. Murine alveolar mac-\nrophages, which express high levels of PPARc, suppress\noxidative burst activity in response to PMA, expression\nof inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in response to\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-c, and production of\nIL-12 mRNA and protein in response to LPS [21]. These\nreports indicate that the effects of CLA in modulating\nimmune responses are similar to effects induced by ligands\nof PPARc.\n\nTwo CLA isomers, the cis9\u2013trans11 (9c\u201311t) CLA and\ntrans10\u2013cis12 (10t\u201312c) CLA are known to stimulate the\nimmune system [22]. The previous studies [23,24] revealed\nthat 10t\u201312c CLA has directly no effects on phagocytosis\nof peripheral blood phagocytes and on chemotaxis of poly-\nmorphonuclear cells (PMN). However, 10t\u201312c CLA was\nshown to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMC) to secrete soluble factor(s) that increased the che-\nmotactic and phagocytic activity of PMN, which may be an\nimportant mechanism to enhance the innate immune\nresponse. The phagocytic activity of PMN was demon-\nstrated to mediate through TNF-a produced by PBMC\nstimulated with egg white derivatives, one of immunostim-\nulants [25].\n\nWe examined whether TNF-a expression in the phago-\ncytic activity of RAW macrophages by 10t\u201312c CLA is\nassociated with PPARc activation.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. RAW macrophages\n\nThe BALB/c mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7\nwas purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul,\nKorea) and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s\nmedium (Gibco Co., Grand Island, NY, USA) with\n4.5 mg/ml L-glutamine supplemented with 10% heat-inacti-\nvated fetal calf serum (Gibco Co.) and 100 lg/ml strepto-\nmycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.\n\n2.2. Reagents\n\n10t\u201312c CLA (98% purity; Matreya Inc., Pleasant Gap,\nPA, USA) was purchased commercially. 10t\u201312c CLA\nstock solution was prepared by dissolving 10t\u201312c CLA\nin dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to final 50 mM and passed\nthrough a 0.45 lm-membrane filter (Milipore Co., Bed-\nford, MA, USA) before use. Recombinant mouse (rm)\nTNF-a, goat anti-rmTNF-a polyclonal antibody (pAb),\nrabbit anti-goat IgG alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugate,\nGW 9662 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), rmP-\nPARc, rabbit anti-PPARc pAb, goat anti-rabbit IgG\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Santacruz Bio-\ntechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and goat anti-\nrecombinant human (rh) IL-2 pAb (R&D Systems Inc.,\nMinneapolis, MN, USA) were also purchased\ncommercially.\n\n2.3. Culture supernatant\n\n10t\u201312c CLA and/or GW 9662, a PPARc antagonist,\nwere added to RAW 264.7 cells culture media with a min-\nimal volume (<0.1%) of DMSO as the solvent and the same\namount as vehicle DMSO was added to control cells with-\nout 10t\u201312c CLA treatment. The RAW 264.7 cells at a den-\nsity of 5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml in 24-well tissue culture plates (Nunc\nCo., Naperville, IL, USA) were incubated with 10 lM 10t\u2013\n12c CLA, in the presence or absence of 0.01\u20131 lM GW\n9662 at 37 \ufffdC in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. After\na 24 h-incubation, all culture supernatants were collected\nafter centrifugation at 5000g for 30 min, filtered through\na 0.45 lm-pore size membrane filter and stored at \ufffd70 \ufffdC\nuntil used. The viability of RAW 264.7 cells was consis-\ntently more than 90% at the time of culture supernatant\ncollection, as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion.\n\n2.4. Protein extraction and Western blot\n\nThe cultured RAW 264.7 cells were lysed in ice-cold\nPRO-PREP\ufffd (iNtRon Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea)\nprotein extraction solution, according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s protocol. Protein concentrations of RAW 264.7\ncells lysate and culture supernatant were determined using\nthe Bradford assay [26]. Electrophoresis of protein lysates\nwas performed using a 12% polyacrylamide separating\ngel (5% stacking gel) in a Tris\u2013glycine buffer system under\ndenaturing conditions. All samples were mixed with an\nequal volume of sample buffer, boiled, and loaded onto\nthe gel. Proteins were transferred (Trans-Blot\ufffd Cell;\nBio-Rad Lab., Hercules, CA, USA) onto 0.2 lm-nitrocel-\nlulose membranes (Sartorius AG., Gottingen, Germany)\nat 300 mA for 3 h. Non-specific binding sites were blocked\n\n\n\nD.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227\u2013235 229\nfor 3 h with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buf-\nfered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST),\nand washed briefly three times with TBST. Membranes\nwere subsequently incubated for 2 h at room temperature\nin 0.5% BSA\u2013TBST containing either a rabbit antipeptide\npAb raised against a synthetic PPARc peptide synthesized\nusing the mouse PPARc sequence, or goat anti-rmTNF-a\npAb. After washing three times with TBST, the membranes\nwere incubated with either anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with\nHRP or anti-goat IgG conjugated with AP in 0.5% BSA/\nTBST for 2 h. The membranes were washed twice with\nTBST and once with TBS. The membranes with HRP con-\njugated antibody were incubated in chemiluminescent sub-\nstrate and exposed to Kodak X-AR film (Eastman Kodak,\nRochester, NY, USA). The membranes with AP conju-\ngated antibody were incubated with nitro blue tetrazolium\nchloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/\nBCIP) (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Ger-\nmany) in alkaline phosphatase buffer containing 0.1 M\nTris\u2013HCl (pH 9.5), 0.1 M NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. The\nreaction was stopped by rinsing membranes with 20 mM\nEDTA in TBS.\n\n2.5. Phagocytic activity analyses\n\nOne hundred microliter of RAW 264.7 cells, adjusted\nto 5 \u00b7 106 cells/ml, was added to each well of a 24-well\nplate. The RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with\nrmTNF-a and culture supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells\n(5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) treated with either 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA\nalone or in combination with 0.01\u20131 lM GW 9662 for\n12 h at 37 \ufffdC under a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere.\nFor neutralization test, various concentrations of anti-\nrmTNF-a pAb were mixed with 10t\u201312c CLA-stimulated\nRAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant. Goat anti-rhIL-2\npAb was used as a control isotype IgG. The samples were\nmixed and incubated 30 min at room temperature. Ten\nmicroliter of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-latex\nbeads (1 \u00b7 109 beads/ml, latex bead size, 2.0 lm; Poly-\nsciences Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) were added to each\nwell for the final 2 h. RAW 264.7 cells incubated without\nFITC-latex beads were used as a negative control. The\ncultured cells were harvested gently by slow pipetting,\ncentrifuged at 400g for 3 min and washed three times with\nPBS containing 3 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid\n(EDTA). The supernatant was discarded and replaced\nwith 1 ml PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde to stabi-\nlize the cells. Phagocytic activity was measured by flow\ncytometry (BRYTE HS, Bio-Rad, Microscience Ltd.,\nEngland) and surface-adherent FITC fluorescence on\nRAW 264.7 cells was quenched by addition of 20 ll of\na 0.4% trypan blue solution to each tube before flow\ncytometry analysis. FITC fluorescence was measured\nbetween 520 and 560 nm on 5000 RAW 264.7 cells per\nsample. The cells were gated by forward and side light\nscatter characteristics. The results were expressed as per-\ncentages of absolute phagocytic activities.\n2.6. RNA isolation\n\nTotal RNA was prepared from RAW 264.7 cells using\nthe TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA).\nRAW 264.7 cells were mixed with 1 ml TRIzol reagent.\nChloroform (200 ll per 1 ml TRIzol reagent) was added\nand the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 15 s. The\nlysate was centrifuged for phase separation at 13,000g for\n10 min. After separation, the aqueous phase was trans-\nferred to a fresh tube, 500 ll of isopropyl alcohol was\nadded and the tube gently inverted to mix. The samples\nwere centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant was removed\nand the visible pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol.\nThe RNA pellet was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate\n(DEPC)-treated water, and the concentration of RNA\nwas determined by absorbance at 260 nm.\n2.7. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-\n\nPCR) analysis\n\nTotal RNA (2 lg) was reverse transcribed into first\nstrand complementary DNA (cDNA) using the Moloney-\nmurine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase\n(Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) and a random primer\n(9 mer). To determine the conditions under which PCR\namplification of PPARc, TNF-a, and cytochrome c\noxidase subunit I(1A) mRNA are in the logarithmic phase,\n1 ll samples were amplified using different numbers of\ncycles. The 1A gene was PCR amplified to control for\nRNA degradation and variation in mRNA concentrations\nin the reverse transcription (RT) reaction. PCR products\nand amplification cycles were linearly related in PPARc,\nTNF-a, and 1A mRNAs. Thirty cycles of PCR for PPARc\nand TNF-a and 25 cycles for 1A were used for quantifica-\ntion. The cDNA was amplified in a 20 ll PCR reaction\ncontaining 1 unit Taq polymerase in PCR buffer (Promega\nCo., Madison, WI, USA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dNTP,\nand 50 pmol of specific primers. PCR reactions were dena-\ntured at 95 \ufffdC for 1 min, annealed at 50 \ufffdC for 1 min, and\nextended at 72 \ufffdC for 1.5 min. The cDNA sequences for the\ndetection of transcripts of PPARc, TNF-a and 1A were\nobtained by RT using the following primers (Macrogen\nInc., Seoul, Korea). The PPARc primers were based on\nthe deposited cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No.\nNM011146): 5 0-GAA AAG ACC CAG CTC TAC AAC-\n3 0 (forward) and 5 0-GTT CAG CTG GTC GAT ATC\nAC-3 0 (reverse). The TNF-a primers were based on the\ndeposited cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No.\nNM013693): 5 0-CCT CCC TCT CAT CAG TTC TAT-3 0\n\n(forward) and 5 0-GAG GTT GAC TTT CTC CTC CTG\nGT-3 0 (reverse). The 1A gene primers (GenBank Accession\nNo. J01420) were: 5 0-CAC CGT AGG AGG TCT AAC G-\n3 0 (forward) and 5 0-GTA TCG TCG AGG TAT TCC G-3 0\n\n(reverse). PCR products (10 ll) were electrophoresed on a\n2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.\nPhotographs of the gels were scanned and analyzed using\n\n\n\n230 D.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227\u2013235\na digital analysis program (Gel Doc 1000, version 1.5,\nBio-Rad Lab.).\n\n2.8. Data analyses\n\nThe one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett\u2019s\ntest for each pair for multiple comparisons was used in\norder to determine statistical significance. Comparisons\nof two groups at each GW 9662 concentration were made\nby Student\u2018s t-test. All data expressed as mean \u00b1 standard\nerror of the mean (SEM).\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1.

A single protein band with a molecu-\nlar weight of 16\u201318 kDa was present in culture supernatant\nfrom RAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t\u201312c CLA and\nrmTNF-a samples, but not medium alone or culture super-\nnatant from RAW 264.7 cells incubated with vehicle\n(DMSO) instead of 10t\u201312c CLA (Fig. 1A). 10t\u201312c CLA\n(10 lM) stimulation of TNF-a mRNA expression in\nRAW 264.7 cells was also examined. As shown in\nFig. 1B, TNF-a mRNA expression of RAW 264.7 cells\nwas detected by RT-PCR and peaked after 1 h of incuba-\ntion with 10t\u201312c CLA.\n3.2.

Phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells. (A) Effect of culture supernatant from 10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW 264.7 cells on phagocytic activity of\nnaive RAW 264.7 cells. RAW 264.7 cells (5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) were incubated for 12 h with the culture supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells (5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml)\nthat had been treated with 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA for 24 h. (B) Effect of rmTNF-a on phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells. RAW 264.7 cells (5 \u00b7 105 cells/\nml) were incubated for 12 h with rmTNF-a at the indicated concentrations. Culture supernatant (12.5%) from RAW 264.7 cells treated with 10 lM 10t\u2013\n12c CLA for 24 h was used as the positive control. (C) Neutralization effect of anti-rmTNF-a pAb on phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by\n10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant. Anti-rmTNF-a pAb at the indicated concentrations and goat anti-rhIL-2 pAb as a control\nisotype IgG were added to the culture supernatant (12.5%) from RAW 264.7 cells (5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) treated with 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA for 24 h. RAW 264.7\ncell cultures were incubated with these samples for 30 min. All cultures were supplemented with 10 ll of FITC-latex beads (1 \u00b7 109 beads/ml) for the final\n2 h. The phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells was measured using flow cytometry. The data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 3, **P < 0.01, compared\nto control (in panel A), vehicle-treated RAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant (in panel B) and 10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW264.7 cell culture supernatant\n(12.5%) (in panel C).\n\nD.-H.

The phag-\nocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells was also significantly\nincreased (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner by addi-\ntion of 0.01\u201310 ng/ml rmTNF-a compared to the response\nto culture supernatant (12.5%) of RAW 264.7 cells treated\nwith vehicle (DMSO) instead of 10t\u201312c CLA for 24 h and\nwas highest at 1 ng/ml rmTNF-a (Fig. 2B). The effect of\nanti-rmTNF-a pAb on the phagocytic activity of RAW\n264.7 cells in response to the culture supernatant from\nRAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t\u201312c CLA was examined.\nThe enhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells to\nculture supernatant (12.5%) from RAW 264.7 cells\n(5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) treated with 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA for\n24 h was inhibited (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner\nby addition of 0.001\u20131 lg/ml anti-rmTNF-a pAb, when\ncompared to the activity induced by the 10t\u201312c CLA-trea-\nted culture supernatant alone (Fig. 2C).

As shown in\nFig. 4A, the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells\ninduced by 10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW 264.7 cell culture\nsupernatant was inhibited (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent\nmanner by culture supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells\ntreated with 10t\u201312c CLA plus GW 9662, compared to\n10t\u201312c CLA-treated culture supernatant alone. In\naddition, Western blot and RT-PCR analysis showed\nthat 0.01\u20131 lM GW 9662 antagonized the expression of\nTNF-a protein (Fig. 4B) and mRNA (Fig. 4C) of RAW\n264.7 cells induced by 10t\u201312c CLA, in a dose-dependent\nmanner.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nExpression of TNF-a is elevated in undifferentiated\nhuman monocytes or incompletely differentiated macro-\nphage RAW 264.7 cells in comparison to differentiated\nhuman macrophages [27]. High concentrations of the\nPPARc ligands troglitazone (30 lM) and 15d-PGJ2\n(10 lM) inhibited the expression of TNF-a as well as\ndecreased the cell viability in vitro [28]. In contrast,\n10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA, used in this study, up-regulated\nTNF-a expression and maintained a high RAW 264.7 cell\nviability of greater than 90%. The phagocytic activity of\nRAW 264.7 cells was enhanced by either culture superna-\ntant from RAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t\u201312c CLA or\nrmTNF-a. In addition, anti-rmTNF-a pAb neutralized\nthe enhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells stim-\nulated by culture supernatant from 10t\u201312c CLA treated\nRAW 264.7 cells. These findings indicate that 10t\u201312c\nCLA stimulates RAW 264.7 cells to produce TNF-a, which\nenhances the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells.\n\nTNF-a is a natural stimulant which promotes the phag-\nocytic activity of phagocytes [29]. It has beeen reported that\nthe enhanced phagocytic activity of PMN by culture super-\nnatant from PBMC treated with immunostimulating egg\nwhite derivatives, was due to TNF-a, but not IL-1 [25].\nRats fed a diet containing 10t\u201312c CLA have the enhanced\nphagocytic activity of phagocytes, correlated with an\nincrease in plasma TNF-a [30]. The CLA stimulated tumor\ncell killing ability of macrophages has been associated with\ninduction of TNF-a expression [31]. It has been also\nreported that CLA decreases the synthesis of prostaglandin\nE2 (PGE2) [32], and PGE2 has been shown to have\nprofound down-regulatory effects on various inflammatory\ncells [33]. PGE2 has been reported to regulate macrophage\nTNF-a production through negative feedback [34]. There-\nfore, one possible explanation for increased TNF-a\nexpression in porcine PBMC treated with t10c12-CLA\nmay be related to decreased PGE2 regulation of TNF-a.\n\nThe results demonstrated that 10t-12c CLA increased\nthe level of PPARc protein and mRNA in RAW 264.7\ncells. This finding is consistent with reports that the expres-\nsion of PPARc was increased in CLA-fed pigs [20] and\nthat the supplementation of CLA in the diet enhanced\nthe colonic expression of PPARc [35]. Since CLA under-\ngoes elongation and desaturation processes similar to those\nof polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as linoleic\nacid, D6 desaturase metabolites of CLA can also activate\nPPARc expression [12]. Thus, the induction of PPARc\nexpression may occur through direct binding of CLA as\nwell as active metabolites of CLA [36]. These results\nsuggest that CLA acts as a ligand of PPARc and activates\nPPARc.\n\nThe present study indicates that 10t\u201312c CLA stimulates\nboth PPARc and TNF-a expression in RAW 264.7 cells.\nWe used a specific and high affinity PPARc antagonist\n(nanomolar IC50, [37]), GW 9662, to elucidate the role of\nPPARc on TNF-a expression in RAW 264.7 cells induced\nby 10t\u201312c CLA. GW 9662 antagonized the effect of\n10t\u201312c CLA on TNF-a expression of RAW 264.7 cells\nas well as their phagocytic activity induced by TNF-a.\nThese results suggest that the effects of 10t\u201312c-CLA on\nTNF-a production in RAW 264.7 cells may be dependent\non the PPARc pathway. High affinity PPARc ligands such\nas the thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic agent AD-5075\nand the non-TZD insulin-sensitizing agent L-796,499 did\nnot inhibit production of TNF-a and IL-6 in RAW 264.7\ncells [38].\n\nIn conclusion, the overall results of this study show that\nthe effect of 10t\u201312c CLA on the phagocytic activity of\nRAW 264.7 macrophages might be mediated by TNF-a\nexpression via a PPARc-dependent pathway.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the National Livestock Re-\nsearch Institute and the ministry of Education and Human\nResources Development (MOE), the Ministry of Com-\nmerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE) and the Ministry\nof Labor (MOLAB) through the fostering project of the\nlab of Excellency.
