We previously\ndemonstrated that Mina53 is overexpressed in lung cancer patients from the early clinical stages. In\nthis paper, the association between disease prognosis and Mina53 expression in lung cancer patients\nis analyzed; we found that overexpression of Mina53 in lung cancer patients is associated with favor-\nable prognosis. Statistical analysis using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method showed that patients with negative\nstaining for Mina53 had significantly shorter survival than patients with positive staining for Mina53,\nespecially in stage I or with squamous cell carcinoma. Because the major cause of death in lung cancer\nina53\n-myc\nung cancer\npoptosis\nell invasion\nrognosis\n\npatients after surgery is distant metastasis, the effect on cancer cell invasiveness was analyzed for the\nmechanisms involved in the association with favorable outcome. Overexpression of Mina53 in H226B, a\nlung squamous cell carcinoma cell line, inhibited cancer cell invasion. Transfection with mina53 shRNA\nincreased the number of invading cells. These results suggest that Mina53 immunostaining is a useful\nprognostic marker \u2013 especially in the early stage of lung cancer \u2013 and that Mina53 negative patients\n\ncularl\nshould be managed parti\n\n. Introduction\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in\napan [1]. Despite development of a therapeutic strategy, improve-\n\nents in prognosis remain unsatisfactory. Early diagnosis can lead\no better prognosis: 5-year survival is 83.9% at pathologic stage\nA but only 66.3% at stage IB, according to a recent report of the\napanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry [2]. Aspects of\nancer progression, such as regional lymph node involvement or\nistant metastasis, are observed in over two-thirds of patients at\niagnosis [3]. Extrathoracic metastases are present in 13% of lung\nancer patients with small sized primary lesions (smaller than\ncm) [4]. Therefore, controlling progression is an important step\nowards prolonging the survival of lung cancer patients.\nMyc-induced nuclear antigen with a molecular mass of 53 kDa\n\nMina53) is overexpressed in various malignancies, such as colon\nancer, lymphoma, esophageal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

Mina53 is detected by immunohistochemistry\nusing anti-Mina53 monoclonal antibody [5\u201310]. To assess the\ninvolvement of Mina53 in lung cancer, we examined its expression\nin lung cancer tissues. We previously demonstrated that Mina53\nis overexpressed in 62% of lung cancer patients from the early\nclinical stages (manuscript submitted). In addition, the enforced\nexpression of Mina53 in NIH/3T3 cells induces cell transforma-\ntion, and mina53 transfected NIH/3T3 clones produce tumors in\nnude mice, suggesting that Mina53 has oncogenic potential. The\ndifferentially expressed genes examined by a cDNA microarray\nshowed that Mina53 regulates several genes related with cell adhe-\nsion, metabolism, and cytokine/growth factors such as epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and hepatocyte\ngrowth factor (HGF). These results suggest that Mina53 plays an\nimportant role in carcinogenesis associated with the cytokine net-\nwork.\nGenerally, patients in the early stage of lung cancer have good\nprognosis following radical resection: 5-year survival is 83.9% at\npathologic stage IA. Nevertheless, approximately 20% of lung cancer\npatients with stage IA show local recurrence or distant metastasis.\nTherefore, identifying patients at high risk of recurrence among\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcan\nmailto:sueokan@cc.saga-u.ac.jp\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2009.10.010\n\n\nCance\n\nt\ni\nI\ni\nw\np\na\n\n2\n\n2\n\nl\nM\nt\np\nm\ns\nm\no\nA\nf\nA\ns\nc\n\n2\n\np\nt\nb\np\nt\na\na\nM\nc\n[\nu\nt\nw\ns\na\ns\n\u2212\n6\nn\nt\nc\nK\n2\ns\n\n2\nm\n\ni\np\nb\nc\nd\no\nC\n\nK.

These results suggest that Mina53 may useful for risk\nssessment in early stage lung cancer patients.\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1. Tissue samples and lung cancer cell lines\n\nTissue samples were obtained from surgical specimens of 101\nung cancer patients. Study patients underwent treatment at Saga\n\nedical School Hospital with surgery but no chemotherapy or\nhoracic irradiation. The population was a consecutive series of\natients treated between 1998 and 2000. Clinical stage was deter-\nined by criteria of the International Union Against Cancer. The\n\ntudy protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Com-\nittee of Saga University and all patients gave informed consent for\n\nbtaining surgical specimens. Human lung cancer cell lines H226B,\n549, and a mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH/3T3 were purchased\n\nrom American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). H226B, and\n549 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal bovine\nerum at 37 \u25e6C in 5% CO2. NIH/3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM\nontaining 10% fetal bovine serum.\n\n.2. Immunohistochemical staining\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis with anti-Mina53 antibody was\nerformed as follows. For antigen retrieval, deparaffinized 4 \ufffdm-\nhin tissue sections were microwaved in 0.01 M sodium citrate\nuffer (pH 6.0). After tissue sections were blocked with 3% hydrogen\neroxide in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room tempera-\nure, each section was incubated overnight at 4 \u25e6C with anti-Mina53\nntibody, at a dilution of 1:500, and MIB-1 mouse monoclonal\nntibody against Ki-67 (DAKO Co., Carpinteria, CA), at 1:100. Anti-\nina53 monoclonal antibody was established using a hybridoma\n\nlone, M532, secreting an IgG2a antibody as described previously\n5]. A DAKO ENVISSION system (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) was\nsed for detection. Counter-staining was performed with hema-\noxylin. Immunohistochemical examination with each antibody\nas evaluated by the following criteria and scored according to\n\nequential arbitrary cutoffs. Staining of the cancer cell nuclei with\nnti-Mina53 antibody in whole tissue section, with no remarkable\ntaining of parenchymal cells, was taken as positive and scored as\n\n(0\u201310% positive cells), \u00b1 (10\u201330%), + (30\u201360%), or ++ (more than\n0%). The Ki-67 labeling index was defined as the percentage of\nuclear-stained cells among at least 1000 tumor cells for each sec-\nion; representative areas in each tissue section were selected and\nells were counted in at least four fields in these areas (score \u2212,\ni-67 labeling index from 0 to 10%; score \u00b1, 11 to/25%; score +,\n6 to/50%; score ++, more than 50%). All slides were concomitantly\ncored by three researchers.\n\n.3. Transient transfection of mina53 expression plasmid and\nina53 shRNA\n\nThe 1.5-kb HindIII/NotI fragment of mina53 cDNA was ligated\nnto the NheI/NotI site of pCAGGS mammalian expression vector to\nroduce pCAGGS/mina53 [4,11]. The cDNA fragment was obtained\n\ny PCR (GeneAmp 9600, PerkinElmer) using a cDNA library of HEL\nells as described previously [4]. One day after seeding in 10 cm\nishes, 5 \u00d7 105 cells were transfected with the indicated amount\nf pCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen,\norp. CA). After 30 h of incubation in complete medium, western\nr 69 (2010) 232\u2013238 233\n\nblot analysis was performed to determine the Mina53 expres-\nsion. The mina53 shRNA construct was established as follows. To\nobtain human U6 siRNA vector based on pcDNA3, the human U6\npromoter, which contains the cloning sites HindIII and BamHI,\nwas amplified from human genomic DNA with primer pairs 5\u2032-\nAGATCTGAATTCCCCAGTGGAAAGACGCGCAGGC and 5\u2032-AGATCTA-\nAGCTTCTCGAGGATCCCGCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAAACCCAAG,\nthen ligated into the BglII site of pcDNA3. To construct the\npcDNA3-GFP-hU6 siRNA vector, GFP cDNA fragment obtained\nfrom pEGFP-N3 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, CA)\nwas ligated into the multi-cloning site of human U6 siRNA vector.\nThe partial DNA fragments of human mina53 DNA were chemically\nsynthesized and cloned into pcDNA3-GFP-hU6siRNA cleaved with\nHindIII and BamHI to produce pU6shmina53(892)/GFP. The syn-\nthesized DNAs for pU6shmina53(892)/GFP were 5\u2032-GATCCCCAGG-\nTGGAATCCACAACTGTTTTC AAGAGAAACAGTTGTGGATTCCACCT-\nGTTTTTGGAAG and 5\u2032-AGCTCTTCCAAAAACAGGTGGAATCCACAA-\nCTGTTTCTCTTGAAAACAGTTGTGGATTCCACCTGGG. Transfection\nwas performed in the same way as with the mina53 expression\nplasmid.\n\n2.4. Western blot analysis\n\nWhole cell lysates were prepared from lung cancer cell lines\nor cancer tissues using lysis buffer containing Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0),\n150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1%\nsodium deoxycholate, 1 \ufffdg/ml leupeptin, 10 \ufffdg/ml aptrotinin, and\n1 mM phenolmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fifty micrograms of pro-\ntein were separated using a 10% NuPAGE electrophoresis system\n(NOVEX, San Diego, CA), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane\n(Schleicher & Schell, Inc., Keene, NH), blocked with 5% milk at 4 \u25e6C\novernight, and then reacted with anti-Mina53 or anti-Actin (Santa\nCruz Biotechnology, CA) antibodies. An ECL kit (Amersham Corp.,\nArlington Heights, IL) was used for detection.\n\n2.5. Analysis of cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis\n\nCells were transiently transfected by the indicated amount of\npCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS, then counted using trypan blue stain-\ning. After 5 \u00d7 103 cells were cultured, the number of cells was\ncounted at the indicated point in time. The experiments were\nundertaken three times. The analysis of cell cycle was performed\nas follows. At the indicated time following transient transfection\nof A549 cells with pCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS, both floating and\nadherent cells were collected by trypsinization and fixed with 2%\nparaformaldehyde followed by 70% ethanol. Cells were treated with\nRNase A (0.25 mg/ml) at 37 \u25e6C for 30 min and stained with pro-\npidium iodine (50 \ufffdg/ml). Cellular DNA content was analyzed by\nflow cytometry and the cell cycle profiles were determined with\nCELLQuestTM software (Becton Dickinson, NJ). As for analysis of\napoptosis, cells were simultaneously stained with Annexin V and\npropidium iodide (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Stained cells were conducted to a\nFACS analysis to determine the number of apoptotic cells.\n\n2.6. In vitro cell invasion assay\n\nThe in vitro cell invasion assay was performed using\nBD BioCoat\u00ae Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences,\nFranklin Lakes, NJ). Twenty-four hours after transfection with\npCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS, 1.0 \u00d7 105 cells were added to each of\n\nthe upper chambers with serum-free growth medium, whereas the\nlower wells contained growth medium with 5% FBS. After an addi-\ntional 22 h of incubation, non-invading cells on the upper side of\nthe chamber membranes were removed. Cells invading the oppo-\nsite side of the chamber membranes were examined.

Positive immunostaining with anti-Mina53 antibody\nrequently observed in early stage lung cancer\n\nClinicopathological characteristics of the 101 lung cancer\natients are summarized in Table 1. A representative case of\n\nmmunostaining with anti-Mina53 antibody is shown in Fig. 1.\nositive staining of Mina53 was detected in nuclei, especially in\nucleoli, in lung cancer tissue, but staining levels were low in\ndjacent non-cancerous tissue. Sixty-three (62%) of the patients\nhowed positive staining (+ or ++) for Mina53 immunohistochem-\nstry. By gender, smoking status, and subtype, proportions showing\nositive staining were: 38/66 (58%) among males, 25/35 (71%)\nmong females; 37/63 (59%) among smokers, 26/38 (68%) among\n\non-smokers; and 36/56 (64%) among adenocarcinomas, 20/32\n63%) among squamous cell carcinomas.

Effects of Mina53 on cell proliferation of a non-small cell lung\ncancer cell line or non-transformed cells\n\nBecause Mina53 positivity predicted favorable outcome in lung\ncancer patients, we next examined the effect of Mina53 on cell\nproliferation. Mina53 was detected in non-small lung cancer cell\nlines, A549, and H226B, but was present only negligibly in NIH/3T3\ncells (Figs. 3 and 5A). Following transfection of pCAGGS/mina53\ninto lung cancer cell lines, protein levels of Mina53 reached a peak\nafter two days and gradually decreased thereafter (Fig. 3A). The\npattern of Mina53 expression was different in NIH/3T3 cells; the\nprotein level was sustained for five days following transfection\n(Fig. 3B). Growth rates of lung cancer cell lines were not stimu-\nlated by transfection with pCAGGS/mina53; in fact, growth of A549\nwas inhibited (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, the growth rate of NIH/3T3\n\ncells transfected with pCAGGS/mina53 was not altered compared\nto those with pCAGGS (Fig. 3B). To investigate the mechanisms of\nreduced growth rate in A549, cell cycle analysis was performed\nusing FACS analyses. After transfection of pCAGGS/mina53 into\nA549, pre-G0/G1 phase cells increased in a time-dependent man-\n\n\n\n236 K.

Mina53 protein levels after transfection were determined\n\ner (Fig. 4A). In addition, staining with Annexin V and PI showed\nhat early apoptotic cells, which were Annexin V-positive and PI-\negative, were more frequently observed among cells transfected\nith pCAGGS/mina53 than among those transfected with pCAGGS\n\nFig. 4B).\n\n.4. Enforced expression of Mina53 suppressed cancer cell\nnvasion\n\nBecause cell growth inhibition associated with apoptosis\nccurred in A549 cells transfected with pCAGGS/mina53, but\not in H226B cells (data not shown), we examined the possi-\nility of an effect of Mina53 on cancer cell invasion. Mina53\nrotein level of H226B cells transfected with pCAGGS/mina53\nas elevated for five days following transfection, the same as\nith A549 cells (Fig. 5A), and number of migrating cells did\n\not differ between pCAGGS/mina53 and pCAGGS transfected cells\nFig. 5C). However, the number of invading cells transfected\nith pCAGGS/mina53 significantly decreased compared with those\n\nransfected with pCAGGS (Fig. 5B and D), whereas transfection of\nina53 shRNA increased the number of invading cells (Fig. 6C).\n\nig. 4. Enforced expression of Mina53-induced apoptosis in A549 cells. (A) At the indicate\nellular DNA content was analyzed with flow cytometry and the cell cycle profiles were\nnnexin V and propidium iodide, followed by flow cytometry to determine the apoptotic\nere transiently transfected by the indicated amount of pCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS,\nnumber of cells was counted at the indicated point in time. The experiments were\n\nstern blotting.\n\nThese results suggest that Mina53 inhibits cancer cell invasion of\nH226B cells.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOur study revealed an overexpression of Mina53 in lung cancer\npatients in the early clinical stages that is associated with favorable\nprognosis, especially in stage I or with squamous cell carcinoma\npatients. On the other hand, Mina53 expression has been associated\nwith poor prognosis in esophageal cancer, renal cell carcinoma,\nand neuroblastoma [8\u201310]. In the present study, death from lung\ncancer was associated with distant metastasis to areas such as the\nbrain, bone, and intrapulmonary regions. Therefore, we hypothe-\nsized that Mina53 exerts different effects according to cancer cell\ntype, inhibiting tumor progression in lung cancer cells.\n\nTransient transfection of Mina53 into A549 cells dose-\n\ndependently inhibited cell growth, whereas that into H226B or\nNIH/3T3 cells did not produce any effects. Because we previously\nreported that cell transformation and tumorigenicity are induced\nin NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing Mina53, it is possible that cells\noverexpressing Mina53 develop the potential for clonal expansion.\n\nd time after transient transfection with pCAGGS/mina53 or pCAGGS into A549 cells,\ndetermined as described in Section 2.

Cells invading to the opposit\nf migrating cells (C) and invading cells (D) are shown.\n\nowever, A549 cells overexpressing Mina53 could not be keep\nlive, instead succombing to apoptosis. These results suggest that\nhe growth stimulation effect of mina53 differs by cell type, and that\n\nina53 induces cell growth inhibition associated with apoptosis\nniquely in a lung cancer cell line.\n\nWith H226B (a squamous lung cancer cell line), although\nina53 overexpression did not induce apoptosis, it inhibited cell\nnvasion. Several discrete steps have been documented during\netastasis: loss of cellular adhesion, increased motility and inva-\n\niveness, entry and survival in the circulation, passage into new\nissue, and colonization of a distant site [12].

Numbers\n\nity and invasiveness are well known prerequisites for metastasis.\nResistance to microenvironmental death signals, such as nutri-\nent deprivation and hypoxia, is also important. It is possible that\nMina53 inhibits distant metastasis mediated through inhibition of\ncell invasion and induction of apoptosis, resulting in a favorable\noutcome in lung cancer patients having Mina53 overexpression.\n\nMina53 was originally identified in the human glioblastoma cell\n\nline, T98G, using the estrogen-inducible c-Myc system to condi-\ntionally activate c-Myc protein. Mina53 contains a JmjC domain\nin the amino acid sequence 128-271 [5]. JmjC domain-containing\nproteins were first predicted to be metalloenzymes that regulate\n\ntein levels of Mina53 in H226B cells were determined by western blotting at the\nin vitro cell invasion assay was performed using H226B cells 24 h after transfection\nlls (C) are shown.\n\n\n\n2 Cance\n\nc\ns\no\nt\ns\nm\ne\na\n[\nb\nt\nO\nt\nl\nt\nt\ns\ns\nh\nT\np\n\n5\n\nO\nt\nc\nr\nc\nl\ns\np\n\nC\n\nA\n\nc\nR\n\nA\n\nt\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n38 K. Komiya et al. / Lung\n\nhromatin remodeling [13]. Modification of histone methylation\nhowed either transcriptional activation or repression, depending\nn the lysine residue and methylation status. In connection with\nhis function, JmjC domain-containing proteins have both tumor-\nuppressor and oncogenic functions in a JmjC domain-dependent\nanner [14\u201318]. For example, JHDM1B/FBXL10 has a negative\n\nffect on cell size and cell proliferation of HeLa cells, which may be\nssociated with repression of transcription of ribosomal RNA genes\n19]. In addition, JHDM1B/FBXL10 expression is low in aggressive\nrain tumors, glioblastoma multiform, relative to normal brain\nissue, and expression levels are associated with tumor grade.\nn the contrary, JHDM1B/FBXL10 and JHDM1A/FBXL11 both con-\n\nribute to induction and/or progression of MoMuLV-induced T cell\nymphomas in rodents and overexpression of either protein immor-\nalizes mouse embryonic fibroblasts [20]. They have been reported\no have histone demethylase activity and to regulate gene expres-\nion [14,15]. Recently, mdig, a gene identical to mina53, has been\nhown to be involved in demethylation of tri-methyl lysine 9 on\nistone H3, resulting in increased ribosomal RNA expression [21].\nhese results suggest that JmjC domain-containing mina53/mdig\nroteins have varying functions depending on tissue and cell type.\n\n. Conclusions\n\nWe show that Mina53 function varies according to cell type.\nverexpression in non-transformed cells induces cell transforma-\n\nion and tumorigenicity, whereas overexpression in lung cancer\nells inhibits cell invasion and induces apoptosis. Considering these\nesults, it is possible that the role of Mina53 differs between cancer\nells and non-transformed cells, as well as with cell type. In overt\nung cancer, Mina53 inhibits distant metastasis, so clarifying the\nignaling of Mina53 could be helpful in developing a strategy for\nreventing or limiting cancer progression.\n\nonflict of interest\n\nNone declared.\n\ncknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Edu-\nation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and the Smoking\nesearch Foundation.\nppendix A.
