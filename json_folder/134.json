Modulations in the cell\ncycle regulator function and expression result not only in proliferative advantages, but also lead to tumor\nprogression and invasiveness of the cancer. In particular, cyclin D1 and p21 are often over-expressed in human\ncancers, correlating with high tumor grade, poor prognosis and increased metastasis. This prompted us to\ninvestigate the role of the cyclin D1/p21 signaling axis downstream of transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) in\nbreast cancer progression.\n\nMethods: Cyclins mRNA and protein expressions were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in\ntriple negative breast cancer cell lines. Co-localization and interaction between cyclin D1 and p21 were performed\nby immunocytochemistry and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. Cell migration was assessed by wound healing\nand quantitative time-lapse imaging assays. In addition, the effects of cyclin D1 on cellular structure and actin\norganization were examined by staining with F-actin marker phalloidin and mesenchymal intermediate filament\nvimentin. Finally, a mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model was used to assess mammary tumor growth and\nlocal invasion.\n\nResults: We found TGFb to specifically up-regulate the expression of cyclin D1 in triple negative breast cancer\ncells. Induction of cyclin D1 is also required for TGFb-mediated cell migration. Suppression of cyclin D1 expression\nnot only resulted in a rounded and epithelial-like phenotype, but also prevented TGFb-induced vimentin and\nF-actin co-localization at the cell edge as well as invadopodia formation. Furthermore, TGFb promoted the nuclear\nco-localization and physical interaction between cyclin D1 and p21. The co-expression of cyclin D1 and p21\nproteins are required for the initial steps of tumor development, as double knockdown of these two molecules\nprevented primary tumor formation in a Xenograft mouse model. Moreover, the in vivo studies indicated that\nlocally advanced features of the invasive tumors, including skeletal muscle, mammary fat pad and lymphovascular\ninvasion, as well as ulcerated skin, were attenuated in the absence of cyclin D1 and p21.\n\nConclusions: Thus, our findings highlight the cyclin D1/p21 signaling axis as a critical regulator of TGFb-mediated\ntumor growth initiation and local tumor cell invasion, both in vitro and in vivo.\n\nKeywords: Cyclin D1, p21Cip1, Transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2), Breast cancer, Migration, Invasion\n\n* Correspondence: jj.lebrun@mcgill.ca\n1Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, McGill University\nHealth Center, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\nDai et al.

To\ndevelop metastasis in a distant organ, cancer cells must\ninitially disseminate from the primary tumor and invade\nthrough the surrounding basement membrane and\nstroma into lymphatic or blood vessels, followed by sur-\nvival, extravasation and re-implantation at a secondary\nsite [2]. As cancer cell motility and invasiveness are cri-\ntical features in the initial development of metastasis,\nmany molecules involved in these processes are becom-\ning attractive therapeutic targets [3]. Understanding the\nmolecular mechanisms that govern these early processes\nmay provide insightful strategies for the prevention of\ncancer progression and metastasis.\nThe transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) superfam-\n\nily is comprised of many members, including activins,\nanti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, bone morphogenetic proteins,\ngrowth and differentiation factors, inhibins and TGFbs [4].\nAmong these family members, TGFb ligands and its\nreceptors are widely expressed in all tissues and the regu-\nlatory role played by these growth factors is of central\nimportance to human cancer development and progres-\nsion. TGFb can be released from storage sites in the extra-\ncellular matix (ECM) and bone, as well as secreted in a\nparacrine and autocrine manner by platelet, myeloid,\nmesenchymal and cancer cells [5-7]. The increasing\namount of TGFb1 is correlated with a high incidence of\ndistant metastasis as TGFb acts on the tumor cells and the\nsurrounding stroma to promote epithelial to mesenchymal\ntransition (EMT), ECM degradation, cell migration, cell\ninvasion, angiogenesis, immunosuppression and modifica-\ntion of the tumor microenvironment [8-11]. Intravital ima-\nging of live tumor-bearing nude mice demonstrated that\nactive TGFb signaling is heterogeneously distributed in a\nminority of cancer cells within primary mammary tumors\n[12]. The activation of TGFb signaling promotes single\ntumor cell migration and metastatic spread into blood ves-\nsels and lymph nodes. However, not all cells with active\nTGFb signaling are migratory, suggesting differential\nTGFb signaling events and specific downstream targets\nare required for this process.\nTGFb signal transduction begins with ligand binding\n\nto the TGFb type II receptor, which recruits and acti-\nvates the type I receptor. The activated type I receptor\nthen phosphorylates intracellular mediators known as\nreceptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and\nSmad3. This phosphorylation event allows for subse-\nquent heterotrimerization of two phosphorylated R-Smad\nsubunits with one common partner, Smad4 [13,14]. The\nSmad heterotrimer then translocates to the nucleus\nwhere it can bind DNA, but with a very low affinity [15].\nIn order to achieve high affinity binding, the Smads\nassociate with various DNA binding partners [16]. It is\n\nthought that these partner proteins, which act as co-\nactivators or co-repressors, are functionally expressed in\ndifferent cell types, thus providing a basis for tissue and\ncell type-specific functions for TGFb ligands [17].\nPerturbations in the regulation of the cell cycle machin-\n\nery often occur in human cancers, resulting in an imbal-\nance between cell growth and cell death [18]. In addition,\nseveral reports have proposed that deregulation of cell\ncycle regulators results not only in proliferative advan-\ntages, but also in increased tumor progression and aggres-\nsiveness traits [19]. Cell cycle progression is primarily\nmediated through interactions between the different\ncyclins with their respective cyclin-dependent kinases\n(CDKs). Among the different cyclins, cyclin D1 and cyclin\nE are associated with the G1-S phase transition [20].\nCyclin D1 interacts with CDK4 and 6, while cyclin E inter-\nacts more specifically with CDK2 [21-25]. The activity of\nthe cyclin-CDK complexes is regulated by two classes of\nsmall proteins referred to as cyclin-dependent kinases\ninhibitors (CDKIs). The INK4 family, which includes\np15INK4, p16INK4A, p18INK4C and p19INK4D, specifi-\ncally binds to CDK4 and 6, thereby preventing their asso-\nciation with the D-type cyclins [26-29]. The KIP family\nincludes p21CIP1/WAF1 (p21), p27KIP1 and p57KIP2\n[30-35]. While the KIP family members are usually asso-\nciated with cyclin E-CDK and cyclin A-CDK complexes,\nmany reports indicated that they also interact with cyclin\nD-CDK complexes [30,36-38].\nMany of these cell cycle regulators are primary targets of\n\nTGFb signaling in human cancers [39-41]. Interestingly,\nsome of these cell cycle regulators, in particular cyclin D1\nand p21, are often over-expressed in many human cancers\nand their levels are correlated with high tumor grade, poor\nprognosis, and increased metastasis in subsets of carcino-\nmas such as breast, prostate, cervical carcinomas and\nlymphomas [42,43]. We previously demonstrated that p21\nis a transcriptional co-regulator of Smad that mediates\nTGFb-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion in\nmetastatic breast cancer cells [44]. This prompted us to\nexplore the roles of other cell cycle regulators in promoting\ntumor progression in breast cancer, aside from their well-\nestablished functions in cell cycle regulation. Thus, we\ninvestigated the effects of cyclins, in particular cyclin\nD1, downstream of TGFb-mediated tumor progression.\nIndeed, several studies have supported the notion that\nthe oncogenic effects of cyclin D1 may not be simply due\nto enhanced tumor cell growth or proliferation. These\ninclude reports showing a lack of correlation between cell\nproliferation and cyclin D1 expression in several large\ncohorts of 779 breast cancer patients [45,46] and the fact\nthat elevated cyclin D1 expression is associated with a high\nincidence of metastasis and poor survival outcome [47,48],\nsuggesting that cyclin D1 may play a role in promoting\ninvasiveness of established tumors.\n\nDai et al. Breast Cancer Research 2013, 15:R49\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/15/3/R49\n\nPage 2 of 14\n\n\n\nIn this study, we found that TGFb induced mRNA and\nprotein expression of cyclin D1 in breast cancer cells with\na highly migratory phenotype. Moreover, we found TGFb\nto induce complex formation and nuclear co-localization\nof cyclin D1 and p21, indicating that these two proteins\nmay cooperate to mediate TGFb functions in aggressive\nhuman breast cancer cells. Furthermore, using gene silen-\ncing approaches, our results indicate that TGFb-mediated\ncyclin D1 expression is a prerequisite for TGFb-induced\nbreast cancer cell migration. Orthotopic injection of cyclin\nD1/p21 null human breast cancer cells in nude mice con-\nsiderably reduced mammary tumor growth in vivo, com-\npared to animals injected with parental tumor cells.\nMoreover, we found that following fat pad transplantation,\nparental breast cancer cells invaded into the surrounding\nmammary tissues, while these effects were blocked when\ncyclin D1 and p21 gene expression were silenced. Collec-\ntively, these data indicate that TGFb-mediated cyclin D1\nand p21 gene expression leads to increased breast cancer\nmigration and invasion in vitro and that blocking expres-\nsion of these two cell cycle regulators in aggressive human\nbreast tumors significantly reduced both tumor formation\nand local tumor invasion into the surrounding tissues\nin vivo.\n\nMethods\nCell culture and transfection\nHuman breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 (hereafter\nreferred to as MDA) and SCP2 (provided by Dr. Joan\nMassagu\u00e9) were cultured in DMEM containing 10%\nfetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine.\nSUM149PT, SUM159PT and SUM229PE (provided by\nDr. Stephen P. Ethier) were plated in F-12 HAM\u2019S nutri-\nent mixture (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT,\nUSA) containing 5% FBS, 5 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma-\nAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 1 \u03bcg/ml hydrocorti-\nsone (Sigma). SUM1315MO2 were cultured in F-12\nHAM\u2019S nutrient mixture (HyClone) containing 5% FBS,\n5 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma), and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth\nfactor (EGF) (Sigma). All cell lines were grown at 37\u00b0C\nin 5% CO2. Before stimulation with 5 ng/ml TGFb1\n(PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), cells were serum-\nstarved overnight. For cell transfection, flag-tagged p21\ncDNA (Addgene plasmid 16240), HA-tagged cyclin D1\ncDNA (Addgene plasmid 11181), scrambled and cyclin\nD1 siRNAs (Sigma) were transfected using Lipofecta-\nmine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according\nto the manufacturers\u2019 protocols.\n\nWestern blot analysis and immunoprecipitation\nProtein extraction buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH\n7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyro-\nphosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium ortho-\nvanadate, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (1 mM\n\nphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin hydro-\nchloride, 10 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin and 10 \u03bcg/ml pepstatin A)\nwere freshly prepared and kept at 4\u00b0C before cell lysis.\nAfter cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for\n15 minutes at 4\u00b0C, the concentration of total protein was\nquantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scienti-\nfic, Rockford, IL, USA). Cell lysates were boiled with 6\u00d7\nsodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Laemmli sample buffer for\nfive minutes and subjected to immunoblot using mouse\nanti-p21 and rabbit anti-cyclin D1 antibodies (1:1,000 dilu-\ntion, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).\np21 and cyclin D1 were immunoprecipitated overnight at\n4\u00b0C using their respective antibodies and followed by the\naddition of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare\nBio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for one hour at 4\u00b0C.\nThe immunocomplexes were washed four times with cold\nlysis buffer and then subjected to Western blot.\n\nReal-Time PCR\nTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNA\nand reverse transcription of total RNA was carried out\nusing M-MLV reverse transcriptase and random primers\n(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nSsoFast\u2122EvaGreen\u00d2 Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,\nUSA) was used for amplification of the cyclin D1 mRNA\nin a Rotor Gene 6000 PCR detection system (MBI Lab\nEquipment, Montreal Biotech Inc., Kirkland, QC, Canada).\nThe conditions for PCR were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40\ncycles (95\u00b0C for 5 s and 59\u00b0C for 20 s). The primer\nsequences were as follows: cyclin D1 forward primer,\nAGCTGTGCATCTACACCGAC; reverse primer, ACTC-\nCAGCAGGGCTTCGATCTG; GAPDH forward primer,\nGCCTCAAGATCATCAGCAATGCCT; reverse primer,\nTGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCACGAT.\n\nKinetic cell migration assay\nCell migration was performed as previously described [44].\nBriefly, 50,000 cells per well were cultured in Essen Image-\nLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, MI,\nUSA). The confluent cell layers were scratched to generate\na wound using the Essen Wound maker. Cells were then\ntreated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml of\nTGFb1. The images/videos of the wound were automati-\ncally taken at the exact same location using the IncuCy-\nte\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Wound width, wound\nconfluence or relative wound density were automatically\nmeasured by the IncuCyte software.\n\nTranswell cell migration assay\nTransfected cell suspensions (40,000 cells/well) were\nseeded in 24-well Cell Culture Inserts (8-\u03bcm pore size;\nBD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada).

The fluorescence intensity\nof migrated cells was measured at 700 nm in a near-\ninfrared fluorescence imager (Odyssey CLX, LI-COR\nBiosciences - Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE, USA) using\nthe Image Studio software (LI-COR Biosciences -\nBiotechnology).\n\nImmunofluorescence microscopy\nFor the invadopodia formation assay, cells were grown\non top of eight-well chamber slides coated with 100 \u03bcl\ngrowth factor-reduced Matrigel. After TGFb treatment\nfor 24 hours, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde\nfor 10 minutes, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for\n3 minutes, and blocked for 1 hour in 2% bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA). Fixed cells were incubated with primary\nantibodies against p21, cyclin D1, F-actin and vimentin\nfor one hour and followed by the secondary antibodies\nAlexa Fluor\u00ae568 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa\nFluor\u00ae488 goat anti-rabbit (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for\none hour. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen).\nConfocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510\nMeta Axiovert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberko-\nchen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using the 63\u00d7\nobjective.\n\nMammary fat pad injection of nude mice\nThe animal study and SCP2 cells used in the mice model\nwere approved by the McGill ethics committee (University\nAnimal Care Committee, UACC) and all the experimental\nanimal protocols were in accordance with the McGill Uni-\nversity Animal Care. Four- to six-week old female Balb/c\nnude mice (Charles River Laboratories International,\nWilmington, MA, USA) were used as a model for asses-\nsing mammary tumor formation and local invasion.\nAn anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine\n(5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1 mg/kg) was injected intra-\nmuscularly into mice (six per group). Fifty thousand par-\nental SCP2 cells or p21 and cyclin D1 double knockdown\nSCP2 cells in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) were injected\ninto the mice mammary fat pads using a 30-gauge needle.\nTumor growth and size were measured using a caliper. At\neight weeks post-injection, mice were sacrificed and mam-\nmary tumors with surrounding skin and tissues were fixed\nin 10% neutral-buffered formalin for one day. Sections of\nmammary tumor were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T.\n(VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) compound and\n9 \u03bcm thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and\neosin to assess local advanced features, including skeletal\nmuscle, mammary fat pad, and lymphovascular invasion as\nwell as skin ulceration. Images of the tumors were photo-\ngraphed by light microscope using 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 objectives.\n\nFor intratibia injections, parental and p21/cyclin D1-\ndepleted SCP2 cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramus-\ncularly into the left tibia of two group mice (six per\ngroup). The mice were monitored weekly for tumor bur-\nden. Digital radiography of hind limbs of all animals was\nused to monitor the development of skeletal lesions at\nfour, six and eight weeks post-injection in a MX-20\ncabinet X-ray system (Faxitron X-ray Corp.). On week\n8, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken.\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe difference between groups was analyzed using Stu-\ndent\u2019s t-test, and *P <0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\n\nResults\nTGFb induces cyclin D1 expression in highly migratory\nbreast cancer cells\nWe have previously shown that TGFb\u2019s pro-migratory and\ninvasive effects are mediated through the induction of p21\nin highly migratory triple negative breast cancer cells [44].\nDue to the fact that p21 is a universal regulator of cyclin/\nCDKs, this prompted us to investigate whether additional\ncell cycle regulators downstream of TGFb are involved in\nthis process. Moreover, because multiple studies have sug-\ngested that the oncogenic effects of cyclins may not be\nsimply due to enhanced tumor cell growth or proliferation\nbut may also involve tumor promoting functions [45-48],\nwe examined the effect of TGFb on protein expression\nlevels of cyclins A, B1, D1 and D2 in the human aggressive\nbreast cancer cell lines MDA and its metastatic sub-\nprogeny SCP2 [49]. As shown in Figure 1A, we found that\nTGFb significantly increased cyclin D1 protein expression\nin a time-dependent fashion. The effect of TGFb on cyclin\nD1 expression was specific, as protein levels of G1 and S\nphase regulators cyclin D2 and A remained unchanged in\nresponse to TGFb stimulation. The M phase cyclin B1 was\nbarely detectable. As a positive control, we measured the\nexpression of p21, which we have previously shown to be\npotently induced by TGFb in MDA cells [44]. TGFb\ninduced the expression of p21 in a similar temporal\nexpression pattern as cyclin D1 in these breast cancer\ncells. To assess whether TGFb regulates cyclin D1 at the\ntranscriptional level, we measured mRNA levels of cyclin\nD1 by quantitative PCR in SCP2 cells stimulated with\nTGFb for 2, 6 and 24 hours. Induction of cyclin D1\nmRNA by TGFb was already detectable at 2 hours and\nwas sustained for up to 24 hours (Figure 1B). These results\nhighlight cyclin D1 as a novel TGFb downstream target\ngene in human breast cancer cells.\nTo determine whether there was an association between\n\nTGFb induction of cyclin D1 and TGFb\u2019s pro-migratory\neffect, we measured the mRNA level of cyclin D1 in a\n\nDai et al. Breast Cancer Research 2013, 15:R49\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/15/3/R49\n\nPage 4 of 14\n\n\n\npanel of triple negative breast cancer cell lines which are\neither insensitive (SUM1315) or responsive (SUM149 and\nSUM159) to TGFb-mediated cell migration and invasion\n[44]. Interestingly, TGFb potently and persistently up-regu-\nlated cyclin D1 mRNA in the highly migratory cell lines\nSUM149 and SUM159, but not in the TGFb-insensitive\nSUM1315 cell line (Figure 1C). Together, these results\nindicate that TGFb-induced cyclin D1 expression corre-\nlates with TGFb-induced p21 gene expression and cell\nmigration, thus, suggesting that cyclin D1 may be asso-\nciated with p21 and participate in TGFb tumor-promoting\nfunctions in breast cancer cells.\n\nTGFb promotes cyclin D1 nuclear accumulation and\nco-localization with p21\nThe intracellular localization of cyclin D1 is important\nfor its function and is, therefore, tightly regulated [50].\nConstitutive accumulation of cyclin D1 in the nucleus\nhas been shown to promote tumor transformation [51].\nTo determine whether TGFb regulates cyclin D1 nuclear\n\nlocalization, we assessed the localization of cyclin D1 in\nMDA and SCP2 cells treated with or without TGFb for\n24 hours by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.\nCyclin D1 was predominantly found in the cytosol in\nunstimulated cells, whereas it appeared to be primarily\nretained within the nucleus after treatment with TGFb\n(Figure 2A).\nWe have previously shown that TGFb induces protein\n\nexpression and nuclear localization of p21 in triple nega-\ntive breast cancer cells [44]. The concurrent TGFb effect\non p21 and cyclin D1 prompted us to determine whether\nthese molecules co-localize within the nucleus in response\nto TGFb. As shown in Figure 2B, TGFb facilitates nuclear\nco-localization of cyclin D1 and p21 in MDA cells.

Moreover, the induction of\ncomplex formation between endogenous cyclin D1 and\np21 was also observed in both SUM149 and SUM159 cells\n(Figure 2D, middle and right panels). Collectively, these\nresults indicated that TGFb stimulates the formation of a\ncomplex between cyclin D1 and p21 in triple negative\nbasal-like breast cancer cells.\n\nCyclin D1 is required for TGFb-mediated cell migration\nGiven that TGFb enhanced cyclin D1 and p21 expression\nand complex formation in these human metastatic breast\ncancer cells, we investigated whether the TGFb pro-\nmigratory effect is mediated through cyclin D1. To\naddress this, SCP2 cells were transfected with scrambled\n(Scr) siRNA or cyclin D1 siRNA. Cell migration in\nresponse to TGFb was assessed by the scratch/wound\nhealing assay coupled to quantitative time-lapsed imaging\nfor up to 24 hours. As shown in Figure 3A, TGFb-\ninduced cyclin D1 protein expression in the SCP2 cells\ntransfected with Scr siRNA was blocked in cells trans-\nfected with cyclin D1 siRNA. As shown in Figure 3B, C,\nwhile TGFb stimulated rapid wound closure in SCP2\ncells transfected with the Scr siRNA, this effect was\ndelayed in SCP2 cells depleted of cyclin D1. TGFb-\ninduced wound closure was not affected by the mitotic\ninhibitor mitomycin C, suggesting that the effect of\nTGFb on cell migration was independent of cell prolifera-\ntion (Figure 3D). We further assessed the role of cyclin\nD1 downstream of TGFb-mediated cell migration, using\na Transwell migration assay. As shown in Figure 3E, F,\nknocking down cyclin D1 inhibited the TGFb pro-\nmigratory effects, consistent with what observed with the\nwound healing assay (Figure 3B, C).\nTo then address whether cyclin D1 and p21 have any\n\nsynergistic effect, p21 and cyclin D1 cDNAs were over-\nexpressed alone or in combination and the TGFb effect\non cell migration was examined using both the wound\nhealing and Transwell migration assays. As shown in\nFigure 3G, overexpression of cyclin D1 or p21 alone had\nlittle or no potentiation effect on TGFb-induced cell\nmigration. However, overexpression of both proteins\nclearly increased/potentiated the TGFb effect, suggesting\nthat these two proteins synergize their effect downstream\nof TGFb. This is consistent with our main finding and\nconclusion, showing that the two proteins cooperate to\nregulate TGFb-mediated breast cancer cell migration and\ntumor local invasion. Together, these results demonstrate\nthat cyclin D1 is required for TGFb-mediated migration\nin breast cancer cells.\n\nCyclin D1 is a downstream mediator in TGFb-regulated\nactin reorganization and invadopodia formation\nCyclin D1 has previously been reported to regulate cellu-\nlar migration in primary bone macrophages, mouse\nembryo fibroblasts (MEFs), and breast cancer cells\n[52-54]. For instance, cyclin D1-deficient MEFs display a\nmore spread phenotype, and an increased cell adhesion\nand actin stress fiber formation through inhibition of\nthrombospondin 1 and ROCK signaling [53]. Therefore,\nwe examined whether cyclin D1 effects on cellular struc-\nture and actin organization contribute to TGFb-mediated\ncancer cell migration. To this end, SCP2 cells transfected\nwith either Scr or cyclin D1 siRNAs were stimulated with\nTGFb and the dynamics of actin organization were\nassessed by staining with the fluorescently labeled F-actin\nmarker phalloidin and mesenchymal intermediate fila-\nment vimentin. As shown in Figure 4A, vimentin fila-\nments co-localized with F-actin at the leading edge of\naggressive SCP2 cells transfected with Scr siRNA, which\ndisplayed an elongated phenotype in response to TGFb.\nInterestingly, cyclin D1-deficient cells were rounded and\nexhibited more epithelial-like phenotype. Furthermore,\nsuppression of cyclin D1 expression not only prevented\nthe elongation of vimentin filaments, but also the co-\nlocalization with F-actin at the cell edge.\nVimentin is required for the elongation of invadopodia\n\nsubcellular structures, which are three-dimensional\nactin-rich protrusions [55]. Invadopodia are selectively\nfound in invasive cancer cells and are important for the\ndegradation of the ECM [56]. As cyclin D1 affects vimen-\ntin distribution, we investigated whether cyclin D1 could\nregulate invadopodia formation. SCP2 cells transfected\nwith either Scr or cyclin D1 siRNAs were seeded on top\nof growth factor-reduced Matrigel and treated with or\nwithout TGFb. Whereas Scr-transfected SCP2 cells sti-\nmulated with TGFb showed increased F-actin-bundled\nprotrusion and invaded into the Matrigel, this phenotype\nwas completely abolished by knocking down cyclin D1\nexpression (Figure 4B). All together, these results defined\nnovel functions for cyclin D1 as a TGFb downstream tar-\nget that is required for this growth factor to mediate\nvimentin elongation, induction of a migratory morpholo-\ngical phenotype, and the formation of invasive subcellular\nstructures in metastatic breast cancer cells.\n\nDepletion of cyclin D1 and p21 prevents mammary tumor\ngrowth and local invasion\nOverexpression of p21 and cyclin D1 is correlated with\npoor prognosis and aggressiveness in breast cancer. To\naddress the importance of p21 and cyclin D1 on breast\ncancer development in vivo, we injected either SCP2 con-\ntrol or double p21 and cyclin D1 knockdown cells into\nthe mammary fat pads of female Balb/c nude mice to\nmonitor primary tumor growth and local invasiveness.\n\nDai et al.

All tumors were taken with the\noverlaying skin and surrounding tissues and subjected to\nhematoxylin and eosin staining. As shown in Figure 5B,\nthe deep tumor margins in the control group were less\ndistinct, invading nearby structures, including skeletal\nmuscles and the mammary fat pad, and showed frequent\nlymphovascular invasion. However, the tumor margins in\nthe knockdown group were well encapsulated with a\nnon-invasive nature. In addition, we performed immuno-\nhistochemistry on primary mammary tumor derived\nfrom animals injected with parental and p21/cyclin D1-\ndepleted SCP2 cells. We assessed the expression of the\nTGFb-regulated gene PTGS2, which we have previously\nshown to be involved in mediating the TGFb effect on\ncell migration and invasion [44]. As shown in Figure 5C,\nusing tumors from four different mice in each group, we\nfound expression of PTGS2 to be clearly higher in paren-\ntal tumors compared to p21/cyclin D1-depleted tumors,\nfurther confirming that the p21/cyclin D1-depleted\ntumors displayed less invasive features.\nTo investigate the role of p21 and cyclin D1 on the\n\ndevelopment of bone osteolytic lesions, parental and dou-\nble knockdown SCP2 cells were injected intramuscularly\ninto the left tibia of two groups of nude mice. As shown in\nFigure 5D, following X-ray examination of the bones, both\ngroup of mice developed secondary tumors that caused\nsevere osteolytic bone lesions, suggesting that p21/cyclin\nD1 do not affect the later stages of bone metastasis. Col-\nlectively, these results indicate that while p21 and cyclin\nD1 are required for breast cancer cells to acquire an inva-\nsive phenotype, their effects are primarily occurring at the\nearlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction of\nlocal cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding tis-\nsues. This is also consistent with previous work, showing\nthat depletion of p21 alone did not affect the development\nof bone osteolytic lesions [44].\n\nDiscussion\nCyclin D1 is a well-characterized oncogene that is fre-\nquently overexpressed in human breast, lung, colon, pros-\ntate and hematopoietic carcinomas [60-62]. This is a\nunique feature among the three closely related D type G1\ncyclins (D1, D2 and D3), as amplification of cyclin D2 and\nD3 copy-number is rarely observed in human cancer. In\nfact, methylation of cyclin D2 resulting in loss of its\nexpression has been reported in breast, pancreatic and\nprostate cancer [63-65]. In addition to the association\nbetween cyclin D1 expression and human cancer, overex-\npression of cyclin D1 is tumorigenic, as supported by evi-\ndence that MMTV-driven cyclin D1 is sufficient for\nmammary hyperplasia and carcinoma development in\ntransgenic mice [66]. Furthermore, cyclin D1 is required\nfor many oncogenes, such as HER2 or Ras, to induce\nmammary tumor growth in mice [57-59]. The function of\n\ncyclin D1 in mammary oncogenesis in mice is mediated\nthrough the activation of its regulatory partner CDK4, as\nmice lacking CDK4 or expressing the CDK4/CDK6-speci-\nfic inhibitor INK4A are resistant to HER2-induced mam-\nmary tumor formation [58,67-69]. While these studies\naddressed the importance of cyclin D1 on breast tumor\ninitiation, its contribution to the development and pro-\ngression of established tumors remains unclear.\nSeveral studies support the notion that the oncogenic\n\neffects of cyclin D1 may not be simply due to enhanced\ntumor cell growth or proliferation. For instance, cyclin D1\nexpression did not correlate with Ki67 expression in a\ncohort of 779 breast cancer patients [45]. In another study\nof 1,740 breast cancer patients, cyclin D1 expression was\nnot tightly associated with proliferative genes that are\nregulated by the inactivation of CDK4 substrate RB [46].\nIn addition, high expression of cyclin D1 is associated with\nhigh incidence of metastasis and poor survival outcome\n[47,48]. Therefore, cyclin D1 is potentially required for\ncontinual development and progression of established\ntumors.\nIn this study, we investigated the function of cyclin D1\n\non breast tumor progression induced by TGFb, a potent\ntumor-promoting factor, in metastatic breast cancer cell\nlines. Our results showed that the effect of TGFb on cyclin\nD1 expression was specific, as protein levels of other\ncyclins in G1, S and M phase are unresponsive to TGFb\nstimulation. Furthermore, using a panel of tumorigenic tri-\nple negative breast cancer cell lines, which exhibit differen-\ntial responses to TGFb in terms of cellular migration, we\nfound cyclin D1 expression to correlate with p21 expres-\nsion and to be required for TGFb-induced cell migration.\nFurthermore, up-regulation of the cyclin D1 gene by\nTGFb is more potent and persistent in highly migratory\ncell lines compared with less motile cells. This is consis-\ntent with a previous study using intravital imaging of live\ntumor-bearing nude mice, showing that although TGFb\nsignaling promotes single tumor cell migration and meta-\nstatic spread into blood vessels and lymph nodes, not all\ncells with active TGFb signaling are migratory [12]. Our\nresults suggest that cyclin D1 is a specific downstream tar-\nget for TGFb-mediated cell migration.\nSubcellular localization and stabilization of cyclin D1\n\nplay an important role in human cancers [70]. We showed\na TGFb-induced nuclear localization of cyclin D1 in these\nmetastatic breast cancer cell lines. It has been demon-\nstrated that oncogenic actions of cyclin D1 are predomi-\nnantly nuclear in many cancers, as carcinogenic mutations\nand deletions often occur at the T286 site, which controls\ncyclin D1 protein turnover and nuclear export [71,72].\nMutated cyclin D1 with constitutive nuclear localization\nand impaired degradation not only enhanced cyclin D1\ntransformation efficiency in vitro, but also promoted\ntumor formation in vivo [73]. Our study further revealed\n\nDai et al. Breast Cancer Research 2013, 15:R49\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/15/3/R49\n\nPage 11 of 14\n\n\n\nthat TGFb-induced nuclear cyclin D1 promotes cell\nmigration by altering cell morphology and the formation\nof invasive subcellular structures in metastatic breast can-\ncer cells.\nCyclin D1 has been recognized as a multifunctional pro-\n\ntein, which regulates angiogenesis, lipogenesis, mitochon-\ndrial function and cell migration [53,54,74-78]. A recent\nstudy identified that more than 100 cyclin D1-interacting\nproteins are involved in the regulation of cell cycle, tran-\nscription, DNA repair, RNA metabolism, protein folding\nand cell structure [79], suggesting that these interactors\nmight influence various biological functions of cyclin D1.\nIt has been shown that p21 interacts with cyclin D1 to\npromote nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 [80]. In addi-\ntion, cyclin D1 associates with p21 to facilitate DNA\nrepair, and this function of cyclin D1 is independent of\nCDK4 activation [81,82]. We demonstrated that in the\ncontext of TGFb signaling, cyclin D1 associates with p21\nin metastatic breast cancer cells. Furthermore, depletion of\ncyclin D1 and p21 prevented mammary tumor formation\nand subsequent local invasion into surrounding tissues.\nOur previous study showed that p21 is required for\nTGFb-mediated cell migration and invasion; therefore,\nthese results not only highlight cyclin D1 as a novel TGFb\ndownstream target, but also indicate that cyclin D1 coop-\nerates with p21 to mediate the effect of TGFb on breast\ncancer progression.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, we showed that TGFb significantly induced\ncyclin D1 expression in metastatic breast cancer cells.\nTGFb-induced cyclin D1 and p21 proteins remain mostly\nco-localized in the nucleus and physically interact with\neach other. Importantly, we found that up-regulated p21\nand cyclin D1 play an important role in TGFb regulation\nof cellular migration and invasion by actin remodeling.\nThese results suggest that cyclin D1 and p21 may coop-\nerate with each other to mediate the tumor-promoting\neffects of TGFb in aggressive breast cancer cells.\n\nAbbreviations\nBSA: bovine serum albumin; CDKs: cyclin-dependent kinases; CDKIs: cyclin-\ndependent kinases inhibitors; DMEM: Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium;\nDMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ECM: extracellular matrix; EGF: epidermal growth\nfactor; EMT: epithelial to mesenchymal transition; FBS: fetal bovine serum;\nMEF: mouse embryo fibroblast; p21: p21CIP1/WAF1; R-Smads: receptor-\nregulated Smads; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulfate; TGF\u03b2: transforming growth\nfactor beta\n\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nMD and JJL were involved in designing all experiments, and analyzing and\ninterpreting data.
