We found that the glomeruli of diabetic NOD mice were infiltrated with T and B\ncells, as well as CD11c\u00fe dendritic cells, which had close contact with CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe T cells in the\ninfiltrates. We also found that IgG deposits in the glomeruli of diabetic NOD mice were accompanied by\nthe presence of complement C3. Moreover, the serum from diabetic mice contained autoantibodies\ndirected towards components of the glomeruli and these antibodies were not present in non-diabetic\nNOD mice. The immune changes in the kidney occurred together with increasing kidney weight and\nurinary albumin excretion along with duration of diabetes. We provide evidence that infiltrating\nlymphocytes and anti-kidney autoantibodies may be involved in diabetic nephropathy in autoimmune\ndiabetes in the NOD mouse. Understanding the role that the immune system plays in the pathogenesis of\ndiabetic nephropathy could lead to identification of new strategies and/or additional therapeutic targets\nfor prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy.\n\n\ufffd 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nDiabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal\nfailure in young people and affects about 40% of individuals with\nlong-standing type 1 diabetes [1]. Current therapy, which includes\ntreatment for hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia can\nslow the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy [2], but\neventually end-stage renal failure will still occur in a proportion of\npatients [3]. Therefore, the effects of currently used treatments\nmust be maximized and identification of new strategies and addi-\ntional therapeutic targets for treating diabetic nephropathy will be\nimportant.\n\nMany factors are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic\nnephropathy, which in humans is defined by a progressive rise in\n: \u00fe1 203 737 5558.\nx: \u00fe44 117 928 7896.\nsan Wong), li.wen@yale.edu\n\nstudy.\n\nAll rights reserved.\nalbuminuria, together with increasing blood pressure, leading to\na fall in glomerular filtration and ultimately end-stage renal failure\n[3]. Microalbuminuria may occur as early as 5 years after diagnosis of\ndiabetes [3]. Structural abnormalities include glomerular basement\nmembrane thickening, increased number of mesangial cells and\nmesangial expansion [4]. Metabolic factors, such as the formation of\nadvanced glycation end products and increased flux through the\npolyol pathways, have been implicated [5]. In addition, growth\nfactors (transforming growth factor TGF-b, insulin-like growth\nfactor IGF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF) may also\nplay a role [5,6]. Although the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy\nis not considered to be primarily immune mediated, nevertheless\nstudies examining renal biopsies in patients with type 1 diabetes\nhave noted T cell infiltration of the juxtaglomerular apparatus [7,8].\nMacrophages have also been detected in kidney sections from\npatients with diabetic nephropathy although no distinction was\nmade between patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [9].\n\nTo facilitate dissection of pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy,\na variety of experimental rat and mouse models have been used,\nmany of which relate to type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we\n\nmailto:susan.wong@bristol.ac.uk\nmailto:li.wen@yale.edu\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08968411\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/jautimm\n\n\nX. Xiao et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 32 (2009) 85\u20139386\nfocused on the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model that\ndevelops spontaneous autoimmune diabetes similar to human type\n1 diabetes [10]. Many studies of diabetic nephropathy were per-\nformed in chemically-induced diabetic animal models and NOD\nmice have not been studied much in terms of diabetic nephropathy,\nperhaps because of the potentially long and variable time to onset\nof diabetes [11]. However, a few studies have shown that NOD mice\ncould develop renal pathology after the onset of diabetes [12,13]. To\ntest the hypothesis that immune responses are involved in the\ndevelopment of diabetic nephropathy, we investigated cellular and\nhumoral immune parameters in spontaneous diabetic NOD mice.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Animals\n\nFemale NOD/Caj mice were used in this study. All the mice were\nhoused in individually-ventilated filter cages with autoclaved food\nunder specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions with a 12-h dark/\nlight cycle. The use of the animals and the procedures applied in\nthis study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee of Yale University.\n\n2.2. Determination of diabetes and diabetic nephropathy\n\nNOD mice were observed for diabetes development by weekly\nscreening for glycosuria. Diabetes was confirmed following 2\nconsecutive readings of blood glucose greater than 13.9 mmol/L\n(250 mg/dl). Mouse urine was screened for proteinuria by Albustix\n(Bayer, Elkhart, IN, USA). Diabetic mice were given a sub-thera-\npeutic dose of insulin (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA) after diagnosis\nin order to maintain the animals in a hyperglycemic state, in the\nrange of 13.9\u201322.2 mmol/L, but in relatively good general health.\nBlood glucose and proteinuria were monitored weekly. Twenty-\nfour hour urine collections were obtained using metabolic cages\nand quantitation of urine albumin was determined using the\nProtein Assay Kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. The urine creatinine was measured by\nCayman creatinine assay kit (Ann Arbor, MI, USA).\n\n2.3. Histology\n\nMice were perfused with ice-cold PBS and then with buffer\ncontaining 10% formalin. Tissues were further fixed in 4% buffered\nparaformaldehyde for 2 days, embedded in paraffin and processed\nfor sectioning. Extracellular matrix deposition in glomeruli was\nassessed by Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining.\n\n2.4. Immunofluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy\n\nPerfused kidney was fixed overnight in periodate\u2013lysine\u2013para-\nformaldehyde (PLP) fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 0.075 M lysine,\n0.037 M sodium phosphate, 0.01 M periodate). The tissue was then\nembedded in OCT compound from Tissue-Tek (Torrance, CA, USA)\nand snap frozen. Cryosections (10 mm) were rehydrated with PBS\nfollowed by blocking with 2% goat serum (Sigma Immunochemicals,\nSt. Louis, MO, USA). The following primary antibodies were used for\nstaining the kidney sections: phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated\ndonkey anti-mouse IgG and rat anti-mouse CD31 (eBioscience, San\nDiego, CA, USA), rabbit anti-mouse laminin (Meridian Life Science,\nSaco, ME, USA), rat anti-mouse CD4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),\nfluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD11c,\nrat anti-mouse CD8 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), rabbit anti-\nmouse perforin antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), rat anti-C3\nantibody (Cedarlane, Burlington, NC, USA). Secondary antibodies\n(goat anti rat Alexa 488, 546; goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488, goat anti\nFITC Alexa 488 were obtained from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA,\nand goat anti-rabbit Cy5 at1:300 were obtained from Abcam\n(Cambridge, MA, USA). Kidney sections were examined and photo-\ngraphed using a META510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thorn-\nwood, NY, USA). Images were acquired with a 63\ufffdwater-immersion\nobjective lens. For some micrographs, Tile Scan was performed to\nobtain high-resolution images from large areas of the organ.\n\n2.5. Electron microscopy\n\nAfter perfusion the kidneys were excised and immersed in fresh\nfixatives (2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4)\nfor w16 h at 4 \ufffdC. For morphological studies, the tissue blocks were\npost-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium ferricyanide\nin 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, treated with aqueous 1% uranyl acetate,\ndehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, and embedded in Polybed\nepoxy resin (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA). Thin sections were\ncut, collected on 200 mesh copper/rhodium grids, and stained with\nuranyl acetate and lead citrate and then were observed at 60 kV in\na Philips CM10 transmission EM.\n\nFor immunogold labeling, osmium post-fixation was omitted,\nand the tissue blocks were embedded in LR Gold acrylic resin, and\npolymerized with UV light at\ufffd20 \ufffdC. The sections were treated with\nbovine serum albumin (BSA), with or without normal goat serum\n(the species in which the secondary antibody was raised), in PBS\nwith 0.1% Tween 20 to block non-specific binding, then incubated\nwith rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove,\nPA, USA) or goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)\novernight at 4 \ufffdC. After rinsing with PBS, the sections were incubated\nwith a gold-labeled secondary antibody \u2013 15 nm gold-labeled goat\nanti-rabbit IgG (Aurion, Wageningen, Netherlands) for 60 min at\nroom temperature. Following rinse with PBS and distilled water, the\nsections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and\nexamined in a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope.\n\n2.6. RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from mouse kidney tissues using TRIzol\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Equal amounts of RNA, measured by\nspectrophotometer and RNA gel, were used for first-strand cDNA\nsynthesis with SuperScript III-RT kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in\na 20 ml reaction. 0.5 ml of cDNA product was then subject to the quan-\ntitative PCR (qPCR) amplification. The primers were designed using the\nPrimer Bank (http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/) and synthe-\nsized by Sigma. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using an\niCycler system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and SYBR green I was used\nto detect the PCR products. The integrity of DNA products was verified\nby both the presence of a single melting temperature peak and a single\nband on a 1.2% agarose gel. Post-PCR data were analyzed by the iQ\ufffd 5\noptical system software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Relative quanti-\nfication was determined using 2\ufffdDDCt method with data normalized to\nthe mRNA level of housekeeping gene GAPDH.\n\n2.7. Determination of anti-insulin autoantibodies\n\nThe serum samples of diabetic NOD mice were tested for the\npresence of anti-insulin autoantibodies before and after the onset\nof diabetes and institution of insulin treatment as previously\ndescribed [14].\n\n2.8. Statistical analysis\n\nThe data were presented as means\ufffd SD or means\ufffd SE. Statistical\nanalysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software 4.0 (San Diego,\n\nhttp://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank\n\n\nFig. 1.

T test or one way ANOVA\nwas performed wherever appropriate. Post-hoc Bonferroni pairwise\ncomparison was followed to assess significance between two groups.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Cellular immune responses in diabetic kidneys\n\nTo investigate whether cellular immune responses are involved\nin the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, we examined\nmononuclear cell infiltration in glomeruli with confocal micros-\ncopy at monthly intervals after the development of diabetes. All the\nkidneys were perfused before preparation of tissue sections. We\nfound that CD4\u00fe (Fig. 1B\u2013D, F\u2013H) and CD8\u00fe (Fig. 1J\u2013L) T cells were\npresent in the glomeruli in diabetic mice. Dendritic cells (CD11c\u00fe)\nwere also present in the infiltrates, in close contact with both CD4\n(Fig. 1B\u2013D, F\u2013H) and CD8 T cells (Fig. 1J\u2013L). In addition, heavy\nlymphocytic infiltration including IgG\u00fe B cells could also be found\nclose to blood vessels (Fig. 1N). IgG\u00fe B cells were either in clusters\nor scattered individually (Fig. 1O\u2013P). In sharp contrast, no immune\n\n\n\nX. Xiao et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 32 (2009) 85\u20139388\ncell infiltration was seen in glomeruli or other parts of the kidney\nfrom non-diabetic control mice (Fig. 1A,E,I,M).\n\n3.2. mRNA expression of perforin and granzyme B and\nco-localization of perforin with CD8\u00fe T cells\n\nCD8\u00fe T cells use release of perforin and granzyme B for their\ncytolytic function. We evaluated perforin and granzyme B mRNA\nexpression in the kidney by real-time PCR. Total cellular RNA was\nisolated from the renal cortex of diabetic and non-diabetic mice.\nFig. 2A demonstrated a significant increase of perforin and gran-\nzyme B mRNA expression in the renal cortex in diabetic animals\ncompared with non-diabetic animals (P< 0.01). This was further\nconfirmed by confocal microscopy showing co-localization of CD8\nand perforin staining (Fig. 2B and Supplementary 3D movie),\nwhereas neither CD8\u00fe T cells nor perforin could be found in the\nkidneys of non-diabetic NOD mice (Fig. 2B).\n\n3.3. Humoral immune responses in diabetic kidneys\n\nAs IgG\u00fe B cells were found in the glomeruli of diabetic NOD\nmice, to identify whether secreted IgGs were also present in the\nglomeruli, we stained the diabetic kidney sections with fluores-\ncence-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. As shown in Fig. 3A, IgG depo-\nsition was found in kidney sections of all stages of diabetes (1\u20133\nmonths after clinical onset). In sharp contrast, there was no IgG\nstaining if the kidney sections from non-diabetic NOD mice were\nused (Fig. 3A). The IgG found in the glomeruli may be produced by\nthe infiltrating B cells in situ (Fig. 3A) or deposited from the\ncirculation (see below). It is interesting that the IgG deposition was\nassociated with CD31, which is expressed on endothelial and\nFig. 2. Presence of perforin and CD8 cells in diabetic kidneys.

The associ-\nation of IgG deposition with CD31 and laminin suggests that the IgG\ndeposits are likely to be on endothelial cells and glomerular base-\nment membrane (GBM). To further investigate the IgG deposition,\nwe performed electron microscopy with immunogold staining, in\nwhich the secondary antibody was labeled with gold. As shown in\nFig. 3D, most of the gold was present over deposits that were\nlocated in and around mesangial cells or between mesangial cells\nand endothelial cells. Gold particles were also present over the\nGBM (Fig. 3D). In addition, some gold particles were found in the\ncytoplasm or lysosomes of mesangial-like cells, which suggested\nthat these cells may have endocytosed IgG (Fig. 3D). There was no\ngold staining in kidneys from non-diabetic mice (Fig. 3D).\n\n3.4. Diabetic NOD mice produce autoantibodies\n\nTo further investigate the IgG found in kidneys of diabetic NOD\nmice, we examined serum samples from diabetic and non-diabetic\nNOD mice. Using perfused kidney sections from normal non-dia-\nbetic mice, we incubated the sections with serum samples taken\nfrom mice at different times after the onset of diabetes followed by\nfluorescence-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG as detecting antibody. It\nis interesting that IgG staining was only found in the sections when\nserum samples from diabetic mice were used as primary antibody\n(Fig. 4A) whereas there was no IgG staining when non-diabetic\nmouse sera were used (Fig. 4B). As the mice were treated with\nhuman insulin after the onset of diabetes, we tested for the pres-\nence of anti-insulin autoantibodies to ascertain if anti-insulin\nantibodies forming immune complexes were responsible for the\ndeposition in the kidneys. However, there was no obvious\npression levels in the kidney of non-diabetic control mice compared with kidneys from\nd as fold increase relative to the non-diabetic control mice.

It is interesting that the normalized kidney weight\nremained unchanged one month post diabetes onset but the\nweight significantly increased two months after disease onset with\na further increase after three months, at which time the experi-\nments were terminated (Fig. 6A). Although kidney hypertrophy did\nnot occur one month after diabetes onset in these mice, urinary\nalbumin excretion rate (UAE) had significantly increased at that\ntime (Fig. 6B). UAE was further elevated at two months and\nremained at the same level by three months when the experiment\nwas terminated (Fig. 6B), while the normalized kidney weight of\nthese mice continued to increase significantly (P< 0.01, Fig. 6A).\nThe mean blood glucose over this time remained unchanged with\nsub-therapeutic doses of insulin during the three-month experi-\nmental period (Fig. 6C, P> 0.05), although the glucose level was\nsignificantly higher, as expected, than in non-diabetic control NOD\nmice (Fig. 6C, P< 0.001).\nFig. 6.

Glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial matrix expansion\n\nAs one of the hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy is mesangial\nmatrix expansion, we investigated the progression of mesangial\nmatrix expansion in diabetic NOD mice by analyzing the kidney\nsections obtained at different time points after diabetes onset. As\nshown in Fig. 7A, glomerular hypertrophy and accelerated\nmesangial matrix expansion progressed with duration of the\ndisease, which was characterized by an increased area(s) positive\nfor PAS staining compared with non-diabetic controls. To further\ninvestigate the structural changes of the glomeruli, especially the\nGBM, we performed transmission electron microscopy. The GBM\nwas thicker in diabetic mice compared with non-diabetic controls\nand the alterations in thickness were irregular and regional\n(Fig. 7B). We also found extracellular matrix accumulation in\ndiabetic kidneys under electron microscopy (Fig. 7B).\n4. Discussion\n\nOur study has shown that, firstly, in the early stages of diabetes\nin the NOD mouse, both T and B cells infiltrate the glomeruli.\nSecondly, we have demonstrated that serum components from\n\n\n\nFig. 7.

Xiao et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 32 (2009) 85\u201393 91\ndiabetic NOD mice, but not non-diabetic NOD mice, bind to normal\nkidney sections, indicating the presence of autoantibodies to the\nkidney. These autoantibodies only develop after the mice become\ndiabetic and appear to be directed towards renal endothelial cells\nand the glomerular basement membrane. Thirdly, we have shown\nthe presence of complement C3 deposits in the kidney. Fourthly, in\ndocumenting the natural history of renal changes in the NOD\nmouse after the onset of autoimmune diabetes, we have shown that\nUAE started to increase after 1 month of diabetes, with further\nincreases as the duration of diabetes increased. Furthermore, the\nkidney weight increased, together with evidence of mesangial\nexpansion, and this is consistent with renal hypertrophy occurring\nafter at least 1 month of hyperglycemia.\n\nThere has, thus far, been limited knowledge about immune\ncell recruitment into renal tissues in diabetic nephropathy,\nalthough recent studies have suggested a role for immune cells in\ndiabetic nephropathy [16]. In patients with type 1 diabetes, the\npresence of nephropathy has been associated with increased\nactivated peripheral blood T cells [17] and more recently, infil-\ntration of T cells into the kidney [8]. In addition, other indicators\n\n\n\nX. Xiao et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 32 (2009) 85\u20139392\nof inflammation in serum such as mannan-binding lectin are also\nassociated with diabetic nephropathy [18\u201320]. Furthermore, T\ncells that have receptors for advanced glycation end products\n(AGEs) have been shown to produce interferon-g upon interac-\ntion with AGEs [21] and if attracted into the kidney they could\ncontribute to local inflammation and tissue damage. We found\nthat both CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration together with CD11c\ncells in glomeruli in diabetic NOD animals. Not only do NOD mice\ndevelop diabetes, but they also have immune cell infiltration in\nthe salivary glands, thyroid, adrenal glands and reproductive\norgans [22]. Unlike the spontaneous lymphocytic infiltration into\nthese organs, we have shown that lymphocyte infiltration and\ntissue damage in kidney only occurs after development of dia-\nbetes and this may indicate that there is an immune component\nassociated with the development of proteinuria in diabetic\nnephropathy to which individuals are genetically susceptible but\nthat requires an important trigger in the form of hyperglycemic\ndamage or an environmental insult [23].\n\nIn addition to the lymphocytic infiltrate, we have also observed\nantibody deposits within the kidney, particularly in the glomeruli\nand related to CD31 and laminin. Immunogold electron microscopy\nindicated that the IgG deposits were subendothelial and mesangial\ndeposits. Such deposits tend to occur in tandem, leading to active\ninflammation when deposits are extensive. Immunogold electron\nmicroscopy also demonstrated the deposition of IgA in the kidney\n(data not shown). They occur later than IgG, and are possibly\nassociated with a later stage of immune response as class switching\nto IgA normally takes place after IgG.\n\nIt is interesting that serum from diabetic mice contained anti-\nbodies that reacted to kidney components whereas this was not\nseen in the sera from non-diabetic mice. Preliminary western blot\nanalysis indicated that proteins of two different molecular weights\naround 30 and 60 kD were immunoprecipitated (data not shown)\nbut at this time, it is not known what the proteins are and this will\nbe a focus of future study.\n\nThe association of circulating immune complexes with diabetic\ncomplications has been studied in the past with suggestions that\nincreased levels of immune complexes are found in patients with\ndiabetic microangiopathic complications, including oxidized LDL-\nanti-oxidized LDL immune complexes [24\u201326]. It is not clear\nwhether immune complexes with insulin are contributory to\nmicroangiopathic complications [27]. In the present study, we gave\na small dose of human insulin to maintain diabetic animals but we\nfound no obvious correlation between the presence of IgG binding\nin the kidney sections and the presence of anti-insulin autoanti-\nbodies in circulation, indicating that the antibodies in the IgG found\nin the kidney were not due to immune complexes associated with\ninsulin autoantibody in this model.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrated glomerular IgG and C3 in dia-\nbetic NOD kidneys as diabetes developed. Notably, age-matched\nNOD mice that did not develop diabetes showed no deposition of\nIgG or C3 in the glomeruli compared to diabetic animals, implying\nthat IgG and C3 deposition in glomeruli is associated with diabetes\nrather than the genetic make-up of these animals. Activation of the\ncomplement system has also been reported to play a pathogenic\nrole in human diabetic nephropathy [19,20,28]. NOD mice have no\ncomplement lytic activity as they lack C5 due to a two-base pair\ndeletion in the coding region of Hc and therefore, the complement\npathway cannot be activated [15]. However, they have normal\nlevels of C3, which could be involved in the activation of the\nautoreactive B cell populations via the C3d component [29].\n\nIn humans, the increase in UAE is predominantly related to\nabnormalities in the glomerulus [3]. In our study we demonstrated\nincreased UAE, together with histological changes of irregular\nbasement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion.\nHowever, this may also be due to metabolic changes in addition to\nthe immune abnormalities.\n\nIn conclusion, the present studies provide strong evidence for\nthe involvement of cellular and humoral immune responses in the\nearly stages of diabetic nephropathy in NOD mice.\n\nAlthough further investigation should focus on the identifica-\ntion of antigens which initiate the immune response, our results\nfrom this study substantially extend recent reports indicating that\nimmune responses play an important role in diabetic nephropathy.\nFurther elucidation of mechanisms of immune-mediated damage\nwill hopefully lead to new therapeutic strategies and/or additional\ntherapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of diabetic\nnephropathy.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nXiaoyan Xiao is a scholarship recipient from the China Schol-\narship Council (2007-102113).
