Carlson\n\n1\n, Michael Hsu\n\n1\n& Irina M. Conboy\n\n1\n\nAdult skeletal muscle robustly regenerates throughout an orga-\nnism\u2019s life, but as the muscle ages, its ability to repair diminishes\nand eventually fails1,2. Previous work suggests that the regenera-\ntive potential ofmuscle stem cells (satellite cells) is not triggered in\nthe old muscle because of a decline in Notch activation, and that it\ncan be rejuvenated by forced local activation of Notch3. Here we\nreport that, in addition to the loss of Notch activation, old muscle\nproduces excessive transforming growth factor (TGF)-b (but not\nmyostatin), which induces unusually high levels of TGF-b pSmad3\nin resident satellite cells and interferes with their regenerative\ncapacity. Importantly, endogenous Notch and pSmad3 antagonize\neach other in the control of satellite-cell proliferation, such that\nactivation of Notch blocks the TGF-b-dependent upregulation of\nthe cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p15, p16, p21 and\np27, whereas inhibition of Notch induces them. Furthermore, in\nmuscle stem cells, Notch activity determines the binding of\npSmad3 to the promoters of these negative regulators of cell-cycle\nprogression. Attenuation of TGF-b/pSmad3 in old, injuredmuscle\nrestores regeneration to satellite cells in vivo. Thus a balance\nbetween endogenous pSmad3 and active Notch controls the regen-\nerative competence of muscle stem cells, and deregulation of this\nbalance in the oldmusclemicroniche interferes with regeneration.\n\nSatellite cells are muscle stem cells capable of lifelong maintenance\nand repair of myofibres, or differentiated muscle cells4\u20136. The decline\nin muscle tissue regeneration with age is largely due to a decreased\nactivation of Notch pathway, which is required for satellite cells to\nbreak quiescence and prevents premature differentiation into myo-\ntubes by antagonizingWnt pathway3\u20139. Forced activation of Notch-1,\nby antibody specific to its external domain (Notch-1 cleavage and\nactivation), rejuvenates muscle repair; whereas inhibiting Notch in\nyoung muscle interferes with regeneration3, suggesting that Notch\npathway is an essential and age-specific molecular determinant of\nadult myogenesis.\n\nIt is widely believed that the microenvironment controls resident\nstem-cell behaviour10, and our recent work established that aged\nmuscle fibres inhibit the regenerative responses of muscle stem\ncells11. Here we examine the biochemical changes occurring in the\naged microniche of muscle stem cells, for example differentiated\nmyofibres, focusing on the age-specific interplay between active\nNotch and TGF-b/pSmad3 and on the ability of this signal integ-\nration to control levels of CDK inhibitors in satellite cells.\n\nBinding of activated TGF-b proteins to their receptors induces the\nphosphorylation and activation of the Smad transcription factors,\nwhich formheteromers (Smad4 as a common component) that trans-\nlocate into the nucleus12\u201315. Different ligands, for example TGF-b1,\n-b2, -b3 and myostatin, are capable of activating the same Smad2, 3\nproteins12,16,17. Increased TGF-b signalling has been implicated in the\ninhibition of cell-cycle progression (both generally and in myogenic\nlineage), by activating CDK inhibitors and inactivating cMyc14,18\u201322.\n\nImportantly, recent genetic-targeting experiments suggest that during\nageing the necessity to impose cell-cycle checkpoints becomes\nantagonistic to the regenerative responses of adult stem cells23\u201326.\n\nThis report establishes the following causalities: (1) old myofibres\ninhibit their own repair by shifting balance from active Notch to\nover-pronounced pSmad3 in resident muscle stem cells, which upre-\ngulates p15, p16, p21 and p27 and thwarts satellite-cell regenerative\ncapacity; (2) active Notch can override this block of satellite-cell\nresponses by removal of pSmad3 from CDK inhibitor promoters.\n\nGrowth factors, including TGF-b family members, are typically\nlocalized and activated in a tissue\u2019s extracellular matrix (ECM),\nwhich in skeletal muscle is the main component of the basement\nmembrane surrounding myofibres and their associated satellite\ncells27.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, there is dramatic and constant upregulation of\nfunctional TGF-b, but not the muscle-specific family member myos-\ntatin28, in the aged, injured and restingmuscle compared with young.\nAs expected, when present at high levels, TGF-b co-localizes with the\nlaminin\n\n1\nbasementmembrane (the immediatemicroniche ofmuscle\n\nstem cells) (Fig. 1a)29. Isotype-matched antibody controls for these\nand other experiments were negative (Supplementary Fig. 1a). These\ndata were confirmed in western blot analysis, which also established\nthat with age both differentiated myofibres and satellite cells, located\nin resting and injured muscle, upregulate levels of TGF-b (inactive\nprecursor plus bioactive protein) and pSmad3 (Fig. 1b\u2013e and\nSupplementary Fig. 2). In contrast, levels of myostatin and follistatin\nare not changed with age (Fig. 1a\u2013c). In agreement with previously\npublished work3, the levels of active Notch were reciprocal to those of\npSmad3 and TGF-b, which is high in young and low in old satellite\ncells (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b). The purity of satellite cells\nin these preparations is greater than 95% (Supplementary Fig. 3)3.\nHigh levels of nuclear pSmad3 were also detected in satellite cells\nresiding in the aged muscle in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 4), and\nexcessive TGF-b was detected in old muscle at days 1 and 3 after\ninjury (not shown).\n\nOur recent report demonstrated that proliferation andmyogenesis\nof even young satellite cells are inhibited by the aged myofibres11.\nInterestingly, factors secreted by aged myofibres rapidly upregulated\nTGF-b production by young satellite cells (Fig. 1f) in transwell co-\ncultures (impermeable to cell migration). This provides a molecular\nexplanation for the pre-mature \u2018ageing\u2019 of young progenitor cells\nexposed to aged tissue.\n\nThese data establish that although both Notch and pSmad3 can be\nrobustly activated in skeletal muscle, because their ligands are\nexpressed by myofibres and satellite cells, with age the balance is\nshifted from active Notch to active TGF-b/pSmad3 (Fig. 1)3.\n\nDuring the first days after injury, satellite cells need to break qui-\nescence and proliferate. However, there is an age-specific elevation of\npSmad3 and diminished Notch activation, either one of which is\n\n1\nDepartment of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.\n\nVol 454 |24 July 2008 |doi:10.1038/nature07034\n\n528\n\n \u00a92008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We hypothesized that\nexcessive levels of TGF-b/pSmad might upregulate the levels of CDK\ninhibitors in muscle stem cells, whereas activation of Notch might\nantagonize this process. After muscle injury, satellite cells were\nderived from young muscle3 and cultured with TGF-b1, with or\nwithout simultaneous forced activation of Notch. Compared with\nuntreated cells, exogenously added TGF-b1 caused a prompt upre-\ngulation of p15, p16, p21 and p27 in satellite cells (Fig. 2a, quantified\nin Fig. 2b). When endogenous Notch was experimentally activated,\nsimultaneously with TGF-b1 treatment, the inducing effects on p15,\np16, p21 and p27 levels were significantly attenuated (Fig. 2a, b and\nSupplementary Fig. 5c) at a range of TGF-b1 concentrations\n(Supplementary Fig. 5). Manipulation of TGF-b/pSmad and active\nNotch balance not only controls CDK inhibitor levels, but also reg-\nulates proliferation of satellite cells in their endogenous microniches\n(Supplementary Fig. 6).\n\nTo analyse this antagonistic interaction with higher precision, we\nexamined whether active Notch and pSmad3 physically interact on\npromoters of the p15, p16, p21 and p27 genes. A pSmad3-specific\nchromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) was performed on\nsatellite cells treated with TGF-b only, activation of Notch only,\nTGF-b and activation of Notch together or untreated.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2c, both active Notch and RNA polymerase II are\ndetected in a complex with pSmad3, suggesting that active Notch and\npSmad3 physically interact on gene regulatory regions. Consistent\nwith the idea of functional balance, forced activation of Notch\nyielded more endogenous Notch and treatment with TGF-b yielded\nmore pSmad3 in these complexes (Fig. 2c).\n\nDNA co-precipitated with pSmad3 was analysed by quantitative\npolymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), using primers specific for 59\npromoter regulatory regions of p15, p16, p21 and p27 (Fig. 2d, e).\nThese data provided a further understanding of the molecular mech-\nanism of active Notch and TGF-b/pSmad3 antagonism. Namely,\nforced activation of Notch dramatically reduced pSmad3 presence\non the promoter regions of p15, p16, p21 and p27, even in the pres-\nence of TGF-b treatment (Fig. 2d, e).\n\nInterestingly, in the absence ofNotch activation (byc-secretase inhib-\nitor (GSI)), young/low levels of TGF-b are sufficient to induce p15, p16,\np21 and p27 proteins (Fig. 3a, b); and pSmad3 presence on the promo-\nters of these genes increases in young muscle stem cells (Fig. 3d, e).\nExpectedly, less activeNotchwas detected inNotch\u2013pSmad3 complexes\nafter treatment with GSI, whereas pSmad3 levels were not affected\n(Fig. 3c). These results were confirmed with several sets of PCR primers\nspanning about 1 kilobase of the studied regulatory regions; and corro-\nborated by negative controls, including the lack of amplification of a\nSmad3 non-enriched genome region (Supplementary Fig. 7).\n\nThese data show that in muscle stem cells, active Notch attenuates\nage-specific induction of multiple CDK inhibitors by reducing the\npresence of pSmad3 on their promoter regions; and that either\ndiminished Notch activation or increased TGF-b/pSmad3 levels are\nsufficient for upregulating these negative regulators of cell-cycle pro-\ngression (Figs 2 and 3, and Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).\nInterestingly, p16 is sensitive to a slight increase in pSmad3, as inhibi-\ntion of Notch robustly enhanced pSmad3 binding, whereas Notch\nactivation did not significantly reduce TGF-b imposed pSmad3 bind-\ning to the p16 promoter (Figs 2, 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7).\n\nResting Injured/regenerating\n\nLaminin/Hoechst\n\nA\nn\nti\n-T\n\nG\nF\n\n-\u03b2\nA\n\nn\nti\n-m\n\nyo\nst\n\na\nti\nn\n\nA\nn\nti\n-f\n\no\nlli\n\nst\na\nti\nn\n\nYoung\n\nOld\n\nOld\n\nYoung\n\nYoung\n\nOld\n\na\n\nS\na\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n c\ne\nlls\n\nAnti-TGF-\u03b2\n\nAnti-actin\n\nAnti-Notch\n\nAnti-myostatin\n\nAnti-follistatin\n\nUninjured\n\n Young          Old          Young        Old\n\nM\nyo\n\nfib\nre\n\ns\n\nInjured/regenerating\n\nAnti-TGF-\u03b2\n\nAnti-actin\n\nAnti-myostatin\n\nAnti-follistatin\n\nb\n\nUninjured\n\nYoung Old Young Old Young Old\n\n1 day post-injury 3 days post-injury\n\nAnti-Smad3\n\nAnti-pSmad3\n\nAnti-pSmad3\n\nAnti-Smad3\n\nS\na\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\nc\ne\nlls\n\nM\nyo\n\nfib\nre\n\ns\n\nIm\nm\n\nu\nn\no\n\np\nre\n\nc\nip\n\nit\na\nti\no\n\nn\n:\n\n a\nn\nti\n-S\n\nm\na\nd\n\n3\n\nd\n\nAnti-TGF-\u03b2\n\nAnti-actin\n\nYsc +\nYmf\n\nYsc +\nOmf \n\nf\n\nT\nG\n\nF\n-\u03b2\n\n u\np\n\nre\ng\n\nu\nla\n\nti\no\n\nn\n in\n\n o\nld\n\n m\nyo\n\nfib\nre\n\ns/\nsa\n\nte\nlli\n\nte\n c\n\ne\nlls\n\n n\no\n\nrm\na\nliz\n\ne\nd\n\n t\no\n\n y\no\n\nu\nn\ng\n\n(Y\no\n\nu\nn\ng\n\n =\n 0\n\n) \n(%\n\n)\n\nUninjured Injured/regenerating\nM\n\nyo\nst\n\nat\nin\n\nFo\nllis\n\nta\ntin\n\nTG\nF-\n\n\u03b2\n\nM\nyo\n\nst\nat\n\nin\n\nFo\nllis\n\nta\ntin\n\nTG\nF-\n\n\u03b2\n\n*\n\n*\nAge-specific induction of TGF-\u03b2\n\nMyofibres\nSatellite cells\n\nc\n\n0\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n\nSatellite cells Myofibres\n\n1 \nda\n\ny \npo\n\nst\n-in\n\nju\nry\n\n3 \nda\n\nys\n p\n\nos\nt-i\n\nnj\nur\n\ny\n\nUn\nin\nju\nre\n\nd\n\n1 \nda\n\ny \npo\n\nst\n-in\n\nju\nry\n\n3 \nda\n\nys\n p\n\nos\nt-i\n\nnj\nur\n\ny\n\nUn\nin\nju\nre\n\nd\n\np\nS\n\nm\na\nd\n\n3\n u\n\np\nre\n\ng\nu\nla\n\nti\no\n\nn\n in\n\n o\nld\n\nn\no\n\nrm\na\nliz\n\ne\nd\n\n t\no\n\n y\no\n\nu\nn\ng\n\n (\nY\n\no\nu\nn\ng\n\n =\n 0\n\n) \n(%\n\n) \n*\n\n*\n\nAge-specific induction of pSmad3\n\ne\n\n\u201320\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFigure 1 | TGF-b/pSmad3, but not myostatin, increases in old skeletal\nmuscle. a, Immunodetection of TGF-b, myostatin or follistatin (green) and\nlaminin (red) in 10-mm skeletal muscle cryosections.

All rights reserved\n\n\n\nTo confirm these findings and address their physiological signifi-\ncance in vivo, we examined whether aged muscle stem cells would\neffectively repair old tissue when pSmad3 is locally attenuated by\nlentivirally delivered short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to Smad3.\n\nYoung and old muscles were infected with the following lentiviral\nparticles in vivo: three different Smad3-targeted shRNAs, non-target\nshRNA to control for non-specific RNA interference or transduction\ncontrol; and followed by muscle injury (Fig. 4 and Supplementary\nFigs 8\u201310). As expected, at 5 days after injury, old control muscle\ncontains fewer regenerated myofibres than young, based on haema-\ntoxylin and eosin histology and immunodetection of eMyHC de novo\nmyofibres with centrally located bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU\n\n1\n) nuclei\n\nthat are the fusion product of myoblasts generated by satellite cells\n(Fig. 4)3. In contrast to control viral transduction and non-target\nshRNA control, the acute in vivo expression of each one of the\nSmad3-targeted shRNAs enhanced and rejuvenated regeneration of\nold muscle (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 10a). Furthermore, in\nold muscle satellite cells there was pronounced increase in p15 (at all\ntimes) and p21 (upon muscle injury); and importantly, p15 and p21\nwere attenuated in vivo to their \u2018youthful\u2019 levels by each tested\nSmad3-targeted shRNA, but not by non-target shRNA (Fig. 4c, d).\nThe levels of p16 and of p21, p27 were not increased in quiescent\nsatellite cells endogenous to old resting muscle, consistent with rapid\nactivation of their myogenic responses in young environments\n(Fig. 4c, d)3,11. A slight increase in p16 and p27 levels was detected\n24 h after injury, suggesting a potential physiological importance for\nearly muscle stem-cell responses (Supplementary Fig. 9). Thus, ele-\nvated TGF-b/pSmad3 assures the age-dependent upregulation of at\nleast one CDK inhibitor at all times, while specific time points are\nexpectedly different for individual CDK inhibitors known to be\nunder control of many molecular cues. These data strongly suggest\nthat Smad3-specific (rather than non-target effects30) rescued the\nsatellite-cell regenerative responses in old niches, as three different\nSmad3-targeted shRNAs similarly enhanced myogenesis of old\n\nmuscle and diminished the levels of p15 and p21, but not of p16\nand p27 in the aged satellite cells (Fig. 4a\u2013d and Supplementary\nFig. 10). Smad3 targeting of these shRNAs is confirmed by the\nexpected downregulation of messenger RNA levels of Smad3 and\nnuclear levels of pSmad3 protein, as well as of Smad3, Smad6,\nSmad7, TGF-b and myostatin in satellite cells in vivo14,15\n\n(Supplementary Fig. 10b\u2013e). Notably, pan-neutralizing antibody\nagainst TGF-b rejuvenated repair of old muscle, and recombinant\nTGF-b resulted in scarring of youngmuscle (Supplementary Fig. 11),\nboth of which are consistent with the effects of Smad3 targeting by\nthree different shRNAs.\n\nIn contrast, inhibition of myostatin by follistatin resulted in multi-\ntudes of very small nascentmyofibres, and proliferatingMyf-5\n\n1\nmyo-\n\ngenic cells that persisted within the injured area (Supplementary Fig.\n11). Such a defect in myogenic differentiation was also evident when\nboth TGF-b and myostatin were neutralized; strongly suggesting that\nmyostatin, which remains constant with age (Fig. 1), is required for\nproductive differentiation of myogenic cells into myofibres. Distinct\nregenerative outcomes, where neutralization of TGF-b but not myo-\nstatin restores productive repair to oldmuscle, confirms that TGF-b is\nthe main age-specific local inhibitor in skeletal muscle niche.\n\nComprehensively, this work establishes that productive muscle\nrepair is determined by an antagonistic balance between the levels\nof TGF-b/pSmad3 (low in young and high in old) and the activation\nofNotch (high in young and low in old)3, which regulates the levels of\nfour distinct CDK inhibitors in resident stem cells. An age-specific\nshift in either pathway would suffice for the upregulation of CDK\ninhibitors and diminished proliferation of muscle stem cells.\nDeregulation of both Notch and TGF-b/pSmad3 thus assures the\nlack of satellite-cell activation in the context of aged microniche.\n\nOur data indicate that TGF-b does not directly inhibit the expres-\nsion of Notch ligand Delta, or the levels of active Notch in satellite\ncells (Supplementary Fig. 12). Likewise, activation of Notch does not\ndirectly diminish the TGF-b/pSmad3 levels (Figs 2 and 3).

Skeletalmusclewas cardiotoxin\n\ninjured3. Co-injection with anti-TGF-b neutralizing antibody, TGF-b, follistatin\nor IgG was performed in some experiments. Muscle was isolated 1\u20135 days after\n\ninjury and prepared for cryosectioning/histology, western blotting or in vitro cul-\n\nturing of myofibre explants and satellite cells.\n\nImmunocytochemistry/histological analyses were performed as described3,11.\n\nSamples were analysed with a Zeiss Axio Imager A1, imaged with an Axiocam\n\nMRc camera and AxioVision software. Western blots were analysed with Bio-\n\nRad Gel Doc/Chemi Doc Imaging System and Quantity One software.\n\nTranswell co-cultures (1mm) were performed with isolated satellite cells and\nyoung/old myofibres. Conditioned supernatants were analysed for secreted\n\nbioactive TGF-b1 levels in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based\ncytokine antibody arrays (Raybiotech). CDK inhibitors were induced in vitro by\n\nculturing isolated satellite cells with TGF-b1 or myostatin. Notch was activated\nby immobilized Delta or EDTA exposure before seeding.\n\nLentiviral transduction was performed with distinct Smad3 shRNAs: acces-\n\nsion number NM_016769.2. (shRNA-2): CCGGCCTTACCACTATCAGAGA\nGTACTCGAGTACTCTCTGATAGTGGTAAGGTTTTTG, (shRNA-3)-CCGG\n\nCTGTCCAATGTCAACCGGAATCTCGAGATTCCGGTTGACATTGGACAG-\n\nTTTTTG. Smad3 shRNA cocktail (shRNA-1, see Methods) yielded results sim-\n\nilar to shRNAs 2, 3. Control transduction with non-target shRNA or GFP\n\ntransduction lentiviral particles was also performed.\n\nBrdU was injected intraperitoneally, 3 days after injury. Tissues were analysed\n\n5 days after injury for regenerative responses and transduction levels by histo-\n\nlogical analysis, western blotting and PCR with reverse transcription (RT\u2013PCR)\n\n(Bio-Rad iQ5).\n\nIn ChIP assays (Upstate), satellite cells underwent treatments for 24 h, fol-\n\nlowed by DNA shearing and immunoprecipitations. Proteins co-precipitated\n\nwith pSmad3 were analysed by western blot. pSmad3 co-precipitated DNA\n\nwas analysed using primers to the gene regulatory regions of p15, p16, p21\n\nand p27. Real-time qPCR samples were analysed using a Bio-Rad iQ5 real-time\n\nPCR detection system, with iQ5 optical system software. Standard PCR samples\n\nwere analysed with a Bio-Rad iQ5 thermal cycler.\n\nFull Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of\nthe paper at www.nature.com/nature.\n\nReceived 6 November 2007; accepted 28 April 2008.\nPublished online 15 June 2008.\n\n1.

Young (2\u20133 month) and old (22\u201324 month) C57 BL/6 male\nmice were obtained from pathogen-free breeding colonies at Jackson\n\nLaboratories and the National Institute on Ageing, respectively. Animals were\n\nhoused at the Northwest Animal Facility, University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAnimal procedures were conducted in accordance with the Administrative\n\nPanel on Laboratory Animal Care at University of California, Berkeley.\n\nMuscle injury. Tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles of mice were\ninjected with 5 ng cardiotoxin (CTX-1) (Sigma), suspended in 13PBS at four\n\nor five sites in each muscle (10 ml per site), using a 28-gauge needle. In some\nexperiments anti-TGF-b neutralizing antibody, TGF-b or control goat IgG (all at\n500 ngml\n\n21\nfinal concentration) were co-injected with CTX-1, following the\n\nsame protocol as described above for CTX alone. Uninjured or injured/regen-\n\nerating muscle tissue was isolated 1\u20135 days after injury. Whole muscle was\n\nprepared for cryosectioning and histological analysis, western blotting or for\n\nuse in culturing of isolated satellite cells in vitro.\n\nMuscle isolation and satellite-cell culture.Myofibre explants and satellite cells\nwere generated from C57 BL/6 mice as described previously3,11. Briefly, whole\n\nmuscle underwent enzymatic digestion at 37 uC in DMEM (Invitrogen)/1%\npenicillin\u2013streptomycin (Invitrogen)/125Uml\n\n21\nCollagenase Type IIA\n\n(Sigma) solution. Bulk myofibres with associated satellite cells (located beneath\n\nthe basement membrane and above the plasma membrane) were purified away\n\nfrom muscle interstitial cells, tendons, etc. by multiple rounds of trituration,\n\nsedimentation and washing. Satellite cells were isolated from purified myofibres\n\nby subsequent enzymatic digestion with Collagenase Type IIA and Dispase\n\n(Sigma), followed by sedimentation, washing and fine-mesh straining proce-\n\ndures, as in refs 3 and 11. Purified satellite cells and satellite cell-stripped myo-\n\nfibres were used in subsequent experiments, as described below. The\n\napproximate 95% purity of satellite cells was routinely confirmed by generation\n\nof proliferating fusion-competent myoblasts after 24 h in growth medium\n\n(Ham\u2019s F-10 (Mediatech), 20% FBS (Mediatech), 5 ngml\n21\n\nFGF (Chemicon)\n\nand 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin); and myotube formation after 48 h in DMEM,\n\n12% horse serum. The efficiency of satellite-cell depletion from myofibres was\n\nroutinely confirmed by the absence of such myogenic potential. Satellite cells\n\nwere cultured on ECM:PBS-coated plates (1:500; BD Biosciences).\n\nTranswell co-cultures of myofibres and satellite cells. Transwell co-cultures\n(1.0mm, Corning) were used for culturing isolated satellite cells with young or\noldmyofibres. Satellite cells were seeded onto ECM-coated plates inOPTI-MEM\n\n(Invitrogen),15%FBS. Transwell inserts, containing isolatedmyofibre explants\n\nfrom young or old muscle, were placed over satellite cells and cultured for 72\u2013\n\n96 h before lysing for western blot analysis (see below). Supernatants condi-\n\ntioned for 24 h, from both young and old control myofibre explants, were used\n\nto analyse secreted bioactive TGF-b1 levels (immunodetection of active protein)\nin ELISA-based cytokine antibody arrays (RayBiotech).\n\nWestern blot analysis.Myofibre and satellite-cell lysates were prepared in lysis\nbuffer (50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate and\n\n1mMEDTA, pH 7.4). Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and 1mMPMSFwere\n\nadded before use. Phosphatase activity was inhibited by 1mM sodium fluoride\n\nand 1mM sodium orthovanadate for pSmad immunodetection. Approximately\n\n30 mg protein extract were run on pre-cast SDS PAGE gels (Biorad). Primary\nantibodies were diluted in 5% non-fat milk/13PBST, and nitrocellulose mem-\n\nbranes were incubated with antibody mixtures overnight at 4 uC. HRP-conju-\ngated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech) were diluted 1:1,000 in\n\n13PBST/1% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were\n\ndeveloped using Western Lightning ECL reagent (Perkin Elmer), and analysed\n\nwith Bio-Rad Gel Doc/Chemi Doc Imaging System and Quantity One software.\n\nResults of multiple assays were quantified by digitizing the data and normalizing\n\npixel density of examined protein by actin-specific pixel density.\n\nImmunocytochemistry and histological analysis.Muscle tissue was treated in a\n25% sucrose/PBS solution, frozen in OCT compound (Tissue Tek), cryo-\n\nsectioned at 10 mm (Thermo Shandon Cryotome E) and immunostained as\npreviously described3,11. Immunostaining or haematoxylin and eosin staining\n\nwere performed on cryosections. For indirect immunoflourescence, sections\n\nwere permeabilized in (PBS,11% FBS,10.25% Triton X-100), incubated with\n\nprimary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in PBS,11%FBS, and then with\n\nfluorophore-conjugated, species-specific secondary antibodies for 1 h at room\n\ntemperature (1:500 in PBS, 11%FBS). pSmad3- and BrdU-specific immuno-\n\nstaining required additional nuclear permeabilization and DNA-chromatin\n\ndenaturation with 4N HCL. Nuclei were visualized by Hoechst staining for all\n\nimmunostains. Biologically active TGF-b and myostatin proteins (immuno-\ndetectible ligands cleaved from the latent complex)14,29 were also examined.\n\nSamples were analysed at room temperature with a Zeiss Axio Imager A1, and\n\nimaged with an Axiocam MRc camera and AxioVision software.\n\nIn vitro induction of cell-cycle regulators by TGF-b andmyostatin.Activated-\nby-injury satellite cells were isolated from injuredmuscle. Cells were seeded onto\n\nECM-coated, six-well plates at a uniform density of 1.23 10\n5\ncells per well, and\n\ncultured for 24 h in OPTI-MEM 11% mouse sera, containing various levels of\n\nTGF-b1 or myostatin. For Notch activation, ECM-coated plates were coated\nwith 2mgml\n\n21\nDelta-4 (DLL4) overnight at 37 uC, before seeding satellite cells.\n\nAlternatively, Notch activation was induced by exposing satellite cells to 5mM\n\nEDTA for 15min at 37 uCbefore seeding. Cells lysateswere prepared andused for\nwestern blotting analysis (described above).\n\nshRNA delivery by lentiviral transduction. Young and old tibialis anterior and\ngastrocnemius muscles were infected, in vivo, with control non-target shRNA\n\n(Sigma SHC002V), GFP (Sigma SHC003V) or pLKO.1-puro (Sigma SHC001V)\n\ncontrol transduction lentiviral particles (at least 10\n6\ntransducing units per mil-\n\nlilitre, as determined by p24 antigen ELISA titre). Mouse Smad3 shRNA-pro-\n\nducing lentiviral particles (also obtained from Sigma) were used for in vivo\n\ntransduction experiments (target-set generated from accession number\n\nNM_016769.2: (1) CCGGCCCATGTTTCTGCATGGATTTCTCGAGAAATCC\n\nATGCAGAAACATGGGTTTTTG; (2) CCGGCCTTACCACTATCAGAGAGTA\n\nCTCGAGTACTCTCTGATAGTGGTAAGGTTTTTG; (3) CCGGCTGTCCAA\n\nTGTCAACCGGAATCTCGAGATTCCGGTTGACATTGGACAGTTTTTG; (4)\n\nCCGGGCACACAATAACTTGGACCTACTCGAGTAGGTCCAAGTTATTGT-\n\nGTGCTTTTTG; (5) CCGGCATCCGTATGAGCTTCGTCAACTCGAGTTGAC\n\nGAAGCTCATACGGATGTTTTTG). shRNAs were used in a Smad3 shRNA\n\ncocktail (shRNAs 1\u20135), designated Smad3 shRNA-1, or individually\n\n(shRNA(2) designated Smad3 shRNA-2 and shRNA(3) designated Smad3\n\nshRNA-3). Skeletal muscle was infected by intramuscular injection of lentiviral\n\nparticles (about 50,000 TU) with a 28-gauge needle on multiple consecutive\n\ndays, before or coincident with CTX-1 injury. To examine cell proliferation,\n\n50 ml of 10mM BrdU was injected intraperitoneally at 3 days after injury.\nTissues were analysed for regenerative responses and transduction levels at 5\n\ndays after injury by cryo-sectioning of whole tissues, or western blotting of\n\nsatellite-cell lysates (described above). Transcript levels were analysed using\n\nSuperScript RT\u2013PCR kit (Invitrogen) for amplification of Smad3\n\n(F5CTGGCTACCTGAGTGAAGATGGAGA, R5AAAGACCTCCCCTCCG\n\nATGTAGTAG) and GAPDH (F5TGAGGCCGGTGCTGAGTATGTCGTG,\n\nR5TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCAT). Amplification products (25\u201340\n\ncycles on BioRad iQ5) were examined and confirmed for predicted molecular\n\nmasses on EtBr-stained 2% agarose gels.\n\nChIP assays and RT\u2013qPCR/PCR. Isolated satellite cells were treated with TGF-\nb1 only, activation of Notch only, TGF-b1/Notch together, Notch inhibition\n(GSI) or untreated (as described above). After culture for 24 h, satellite cells were\n\nfixed with 1% PFA and ChIP assay was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s\n\nguidelines (Upstate). Fragments of about 500 base pairs were produced by shear-\n\ning DNA with attached proteins (confirmed by EtBr-stained gels), and precipi-\n\ntated with antibodies to DNA-bound protein. Proteins that co-precipitated\n\nwith pSmad3 were analysed by western blot, using indicated antibodies.\n\nDNA that co-precipitated with pSmad3 was analysed using primers specific\n\nfor the 59 gene regulatory regions of p15, p16, p21 and p27 (p15\n\nF5TCACCGAAGCTACTGGGTCT , R5GTTCAGGGCGTTGGGATCT; p16\n\nF5GTCACACGACTGGGCGATT, R5GTTGCCCATCATCATCACCT and\n\nF5GATGACTTCACCCCGTCACT, R5AACACCCCTGAAAACACTGC/GT\n\nCCCTCCTTCCTTCCTCTG; p21 F5CCGCGGTGTCAGAGTCTA, R5CAT\n\nGAGCGCATCGCAATC; p27 F5AGCCTACGCTCCGACTGTT, R5AGTT\n\nCTGCGACTGCACACAG and F5CTAGCCACCGAAGCTCCTAA, R5AGT\n\nTCTGCGACTGCACACAG and F5CTGGCTCTGCTCCATTTGAC, R5G\n\nGCTCCCGTTAGACACTCTC). GAPDH primers (see above) were used as con-\n\ntrol for Smad3 non-enriched genomic regions. Primers were designed with\n\nOligoPerfect Designer (Invitrogen). For RT\u2013qPCR, samples were analysed using\n\na Bio-Rad iQ5 real-time PCRdetection system,with iQ5 optical system software.\n\nFor PCR, samples were amplified with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase\n\n(Invitrogen) and analysed on a Bio-Rad iQ5 system. After 40\u201355 cycles of amp-\n\nlification, fragments produced from each primer set were examined and con-\n\nfirmed for their predicted molecular masses on EtBr-stained 2% agarose gels.\n\nFifty-five cycles of amplification were used for negative control PCR reactions.\n\nReagents.

Carlson, Michael Hsu & Irina M. Conboy\n\nNature 454, 528\u2013532 (2008); doi:10.1038/nature07034\n\nIn Fig. 1a of this Letter, the immunofluorescence images for myostatin \nand follistatin are inaccurate owing to many versions of this figure in \nmultiple revisions of our manuscript. Specifically, the immunofluores-\ncence panels representing anti-myostatin and anti-follistatin staining \nwere duplicated. We would like to thank the anonymous reader who \npointed out this error. We have repeated the age-specific immunoflu-\norescence experiments for myostatin and follistatin, and the results \nconfirm our original conclusion that no age-specific differences are \ndetected (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we have performed quantification of \nthe pixel density, and although there are areas with higher and lower \nsignals for these proteins in both young and old muscle sections, the \nP\u00a0values suggest no age-specific differences. We thank M. Mehdipour \nfor performing the experiments and analysing the data on age-specific \nmuscle tissue levels of myostatin and follistatin.\n\nCORRECTIONS & AMENDMENTS\n\nFollistatin Dystrophin Hoechst\n\nYoung Old Young Old\n\nMyostatin Dystrophin Hoechst\n\na\n\nFigure 1 | This is a repeat of Fig. 1a of the original Letter.
