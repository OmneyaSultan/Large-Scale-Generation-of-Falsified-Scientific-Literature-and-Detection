Wa\na b s t r a c t\n\nIt has been widely reported that interleukin-8 (IL-8) is overexpressed in ovarian cyst fluid, ascites, serum,\nand tumor tissue from ovarian cancer (OVCA) patients, and elevated IL-8 expression correlates with a\npoor final outcome and chemosensitivity. However, the role of IL-8 expression in the acquisition of the\nchemoresistance phenotype and the underlining mechanisms of drug resistance in OVCA cells are not\nyet fully understood. Here we show that both exogenous (a relatively short period of treatment with\nrecombination IL-8) and endogenous IL-8 (by transfecting with plasmid encoding for sense IL-8) induce\ncisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in non-IL-8-expressing A2780 cells, while deleting of endogenous IL-8\nexpression in IL-8-overexpressing SKOV-3 cells (by transfecting with plasmid encoding for antisense IL-8)\npromotes the sensitivity of these cells to anticancer drugs. IL-8-mediated resistance of OVCA cells exhib-\nits decreased proteolytic activation of caspase-3. Meanwhile, the further study demonstrates that the\nchemoresistance caused by IL-8 is associated with increased expression of both multidrug resistance-\nrelated genes (MDR1) and apoptosis inhibitory proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and XIAP), as well as activation\nof PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK signaling. Therefore, modulation of IL-8 expression or its related signaling\npathway may be a promising strategy of treatment for drug-resistant OVCA.\n\n\ufffd 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n1. Introduction\n\nOvarian cancer (OVCA) is the second most common and the\nmost deadly malignancy of the female reproductive tract [1].\nAlthough tumor-reductive surgery and carboplatin- and paclit-\naxel-based chemotherapy regimens are effective treatments for\nprimary disease in the majority of OVCA patients, recurrence is\ncommon and often leads to death. As a consequence, the overall\n5-year survival is only 30% [2]. Thus, there is a pressing need to\neither identify novel therapies for OVCA or to discover drugs which\n(re)sensitize tumor cells to existing chemotherapy. Several factors\nhave previously been implicated in drug resistance, including\ngenes which regulate drug influx and efflux, drug metabolism,\ndamage repair, and the apoptotic response to drug-induced dam-\nage. Indeed, it is possible that numerous resistance mechanisms\nElsevier Ltd.\n\nnology, Medical College of\nrict, Chenlin Road, No. 211,\n2 60578099; fax: +86 22 022\n\nng).\ncould contribute to a drug-resistant phenotype and these mecha-\nnisms might be coordinately regulated [3].\n\nInterleukin-8 (IL-8) is a multifunctional chemokine that is se-\ncreted by multiple cell types, including monocytes, neutrophils,\nendothelial and mesothelial cells, and tumor cells. As a member\nof the Cysteine-X-Cysteine (CXC) motif chemokines, IL-8 is respon-\nsible for recruiting neutrophils, T cells, and basophils during im-\nmune system activation [4\u20137]. Induction of IL-8 expression is\nmediated primarily by activator protein and/or nuclear factor kap-\npa B (NF-jB), although additional hormone response elements and\nnuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL-6) consensus sites have been character-\nized on the IL-8 gene promote [8]. Studies have shown that tumor\nprogression and metastasis may be associated with overexpression\nof IL-8 [9,10].\n\nIL-8 was elevated in ovarian cyst fluid, ascites, serum, and tumor\ntissue from OVCA patients [11\u201322], and elevated IL-8 expression\nwas associated with poor prognosis [15,22] and chemosensitivity\n[19\u201322]. Our previous study demonstrated that IL-8 may contribute\nto OVCA cell growth partly through the activation of androgen\nreceptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) pathways [23,24]. In vitro\nstudies with OVCA cell lines show that generation of paclitaxel-\nresistant sublines is often associated with increased IL-8 mRNA\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.06.005\nmailto:wy68wy68@yahoo.com.cn\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.06.005\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n366 Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375\nexpression using cDNA array technology [25]. However, the role of\nIL-8 expression in the acquisition of the chemoresistance phenotype\nand the underlining mechanisms of drug resistance in OVCA cells\nremain unclear.\n\nIL-8 exerts its effects by binding to two cell-surface G protein-\ncoupled receptors (GPCR), IL-8 receptor A and IL-8 receptor B or\nCXCR1 and CXCR2, respectively. Both receptors are expressed on\nmost tumor cells as well as on endothelial cells [26,27]. Signals are\ntransmitted across the membrane through ligand-induced confor-\nmational changes, exposing epitopes on the intracellular loops and\ncarboxy-terminal tail of the receptor that promote coupling to func-\ntional heterotrimeric G proteins. After activation of heterotrimeric\nsmall G proteins, IL-8 signaling promotes activation of the primary\neffectors PI3 K (phosphotidylinositol 3 kinase) or phospholipase C,\npromoting the activation of Akt, PKC (protein kinase C), calcium\nmobilization and/or Ras/Raf/MEK(mitogen-activated protein or\nextracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase)/ERK(extracellular\nsignal regulated kinase) signaling cascades [8]. In addition, IL-8 sig-\nnaling activates members of the RhoGTPase family and activates a\nnumber of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases [e.g., Src family kinases\nand focal adhesion kinase (FAK)] that regulate the architecture of\nthe cell cytoskeleton and its interaction with the surrounding extra-\ncellular environment [8]. Recently, growing evidence suggests acti-\nvation of PI3 K/Akt [28\u201331] and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK [32\u201334] signaling\npathways play an important role in chemoresistance of OVCA.\nTherefore, we hypothesized that one potential mechanism that\nIL-8 induces chemoresistance of OVCA cells by triggering activation\nof PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK signaling.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the role of IL-8 expression in mod-\nulating cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in OVCA cells.\nFurthermore, we also explored possible underlying mechanisms\ninvolved in drug resistance induced by IL-8. Our data suggest that\nthe autocrine production of IL-8 by OVCA cells promotes resistance\nof these cells to chemotherapy through decrease of proteolytic acti-\nvation of caspase-3. The further study demonstrates that IL-8-in-\nduced resistance of OVCA cells may be associated with up-\nregulation of multidrug resistance-related genes [multidrug resis-\ntance gene 1 (MDR1)] and apoptosis inhibitory proteins [Bcl-2,\nBcl-xL and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)], as well as activa-\ntion of Ras/MEK/ERK and PI3 K/Akt signaling.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cell lines and cell culture\n\nHuman OVCA cell lines A2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 were ob-\ntained from the American Type Culture Collection. A2780 and\nSKOV-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.,\nGaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life\nTechnologies, Inc.), CAOV-3 cells were grown in DMEM (Life Tech-\nnologies, Inc.) with 15% FBS.\n\nRecombinant human IL-8 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was\nused to pretreat A2780 cells. The cells were cultured in the pres-\nence of exogenous IL-8 (50 ng/ml) for 10 days. IL-8 was added to\nthe culture every 2 days [35]. After the pretreatment period, the\ncells (A2780/preIL-8) were harvested, washed, and replated in\nthe presence of IL-8, and their resistance to cisplatin or paclitaxel\nwas determined by the MTT assay.\n2.2. pcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8 (i.e., sense IL-8 vector) and pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-\n8 (i.e., antisense IL-8 vector) expression vector construction\n\nA 318 base pair cDNA fragment containing the full ORF of human\nIL-8 was amplified by RT-PCR from the RNA of SKOV-3 cell line that\noverexpresses IL-8. PCR primers for sense IL-8 were: forward\n50-CTCGGATCCATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTG-30 to introduce a Bam-\nHI site as italicized, and reverse 50-AGACTCGAGTTATGAATTCTCA\nGCCCTCTT-30 to introduce a XhoI site as italicized. PCR primers for\nantisense IL-8 were: forward 50-CTCGGATCCATGTGAATTCT-\nCAGCCCTCTT-30 to introduce a BamHI site as italicized, and reverse\n50-AGACTCGAGTTAACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTG-30 to introduce a XhoI\nsite as italicized. The resulting sense or antisense IL-8 PCR product\nwas cloned to pCR\ufffd 2.1 vector using Invitrogen\u2019s Original TA Cloning\nKit (Carlsbad, CA, USA). After sequence confirmation, sense or anti-\nsense IL-8 was cut from the pCR\ufffd 2.1 vector, purified, subcloned to\nthe BamHI and EcoRI (Life Technologies) sites of the pcDNA3.1(+)\nexpression vectors (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). We used DNA se-\nquence analysis and restriction enzyme mapping to distinguish be-\ntween the resulting plasmids, pcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8 (i.e., sense IL-8\nvector) and pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-8 (i.e., antisense IL-8 vector), which\nconstitutively expressed the IL-8 cDNA in the sense and antisense\norientations, respectively, from a cytomegalovirus promoter. We\nused the pcDNA3.1(+) vector without IL-8 inserts as negative con-\ntrols in subsequent experiments.\n\n2.3. Generation and selection of cells stably transfected with\npcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8 and pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-8\n\nTransfection was done using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen,\nSan Diego, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions. A2780 and SKOV-3 cells (4 \ufffd 105) were plated onto 6-well\nplates until 90\u201395% confluence before transfection. A2780 cells\nwere transfected with 4 lg of pcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8, and SKOV-3\ncells were transfected with 4 lg of pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-8. Selection\nfor the neomycin gene was initiated 48 h after transfection by add-\ning 500 lg (A2780 cells) or 600 lg (SKOV-3 cells) of G418 (Life\nTechnologies)/mL to the supplemented culture medium. This\nselection medium was changed every 2 days for 4 weeks, until all\nnon-transfected cells died. Resistant cell clones were isolated and\nexpanded for further characterization. The empty vector\npcDNA3.1(+) was also transfected into A2780 or SKOV-3 cells\nand served as negative controls.\n\n2.4. Semiquantitative RT-PCR\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen, San\nDiego, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Primer se-\nquences were designed by Vector NTI 8 software and synthesized\nby TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Dalian, China). The primer se-\nquences were as follow: IL-8, 50-AACATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCG-30\n\n(forward) and 50-CAGTTTT CCTTGGGGTCCAGAC-30 (reverse), for\nMDR1, 50-TGACTACCAGGCTCGCCAATGA T-30 (forward) and 50-TGT\nGCCACCAAGTAGGCTCCAAA-30 (reverse), for Bcl-2, 50-TGC ACCTGAC\nGCCCTTCAC-30 (forward) and 50-AGACAGCCAGGAGAAATCAAACAG-\n30 (reverse), for Bcl-xL, 50-ATGTCTCAGAGCAACCGGGAGC-30 (for-\nward) and 50-GCGATC CGACTCACCAATACCT-30 (reverse), for XIAP,\n50-ATGATACCATCTTCCAAAATC C-30 (forward) and 50-TTTCTGTAATG\nAAGTCTGACTT-30 (reverse), for b-actin, 50-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATC-\nCATGAAAC-30 (forward) and 50-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCC-\n30 (reverse). One Step RNA PCR Kit (AMV) (TaKaRa Biotechnology)\nwas used to do RT-PCR. PCR products were fractionated on 1.5% aga-\nrose gel and analyzed with Quantity One-4.5.6 software (Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA). The results were normalized against b-actin, and pre-\nsented as target mRNA: b-actin ratio.\n\n2.5. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n\nThe cells were cultured for 48 h in 1 ml of medium containing\n5% charcoal-stripped FBS (sFBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The\nsupernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation. The\n\n\n\nY. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375 367\nlevel of IL-8 was measured using ELISA Kits (R&D Systems)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n2.6. Western blot analysis\n\nAnalysis and quantitation were performed as previously\ndescribed [35]. In brief, cell lysates were subjected to 8\u201312 %\nSDS\u2013PAGE and analyzed by blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-\n8RA, anti-IL-8RB, anti-MDR1, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-xL, or anti-XIAP\nantibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), respectively.\nMembranes were stripped by incubating with stripping buffer at\n50 \ufffdC for 30 min and then blotted with mouse monoclonal anti-b-ac-\ntin antibody (Sigma). Immunodetection was performed using the\ncorresponding secondary HRP-conjugated antibody, and HRP activ-\nity was detected using chemiluminescent substrate Kit (SuperSig-\nnal\ufffd Westpico Trial Kit, Pierce Biochemicals).\n\nA2780 cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes with the\ndensity of 4 \ufffd 106 cells for 24 h, and then incubated in 5% sFBS\nwith vehicle DMSO, or wortmannin (100 or 200 nM), or PD98059\n(25 or 50 lM) for 30 min prior to IL-8 (50 ng/ml) for 6 h. Total cell\nlysates were isolated and quantified. The phosphorylation status of\nAkt and ERK was analyzed by Western blot as described above, ex-\ncept that the filters were probed with anti-phospho-Akt or anti-\nphospho-ERK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA)\nto detect phosphorylated Akt or phosphorylated ERK, visualized\nby chemiluminescent substrate Kit. The filters were subsequently\nstripped and then reprobed with anti-Akt antibodies (Cell Signal-\ning Technology, Beverly, MA) or anti-ERK (BD Biosciences, San\nDiego, CA) to detect both the phosphorylated and unphosphory-\nlated forms of Akt or ERK.\n\n2.7. Cytotoxicity assay\n\nIn vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed by MTT assay as\npreviously described [23,24]. MTT was obtained from Sigma\n(St. Louis, MO, USA). Briefly, 4 \ufffd 104 cells per well were plated in\n96-well plates. Culture medium was RPMI 1640 containing\nincreasing concentrations of cisplatin or paclitaxel (all obtained\nfrom commercial sources). After culture for 48 h, MTT solution\n(0.5 mg/ml PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h.\nAfter dissolving the resulting formazan product with acid-isopro-\npanol, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using ELISA micro-\nplate reader. Data represents the average absorbance of six wells in\none experiment. The percentage of surviving cells was estimated\nby dividing the A490 nm of treated cells by the A490 nm of control\ncells. The IC50 is defined as the drug concentration required to in-\nhibit A490 to 50% of the control value. IC50 values were estimated\nfrom the dose\u2013response curve. Data were derived from at least\nthree independent experiments.\n\nA2780 cells pretreated with IL-8 (A2780/preIL-8) were plated in\n96-well plates at 4 \ufffd 103 cells per well for 24 h, and then incubated\nin 5% sFBS with vehicle DMSO, or wortmannin (100 or 200 nM), or\nPD98059 (25 or 50 lM) for 30 min prior to IL-8 (50 ng/ml) and cis-\nplatin (1 or 10 lM) or paclitaxel (0.01 or 0.1 lM) or control for\n48 h. MTT assay was performed as described above. Data are\nshown as the mean \u00b1 SD of two separate experiments with sextu-\nple samples.\n\n2.8. Caspase-3 activation assay\n\nCaspase-3 activation assay was performed as previously\ndescribed [35]. Briefly, cells left untreated or treated with 10 lM\ncisplatin or 0.1 lM paclitaxel for 24 h and then lysed in lysis buffer\nfor 10 min on ice. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm\nfor 5 min, and 100 lg of protein was incubated with 20 ll of reac-\ntion buffer and 10 ll of caspase-3 substrate at 37 \ufffdC for 1 h, and\nabsorbance was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm on a plate\nreader. Blank values were subtracted, and fold increase in activity\nwas calculated based on activity measured from untreated cells.\nEach sample was measured in triplicates.\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\n\nData are expressed as the mean of three experiments, each in\ntriplicate or sextuple samples for individual treatments or dosage\nregimens. Statistical analysis was carried out using a one-way AN-\nOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Values are presented as the\nmean \u00b1 SD.

Comparing expression levels of IL-8 and its receptor (IL-8RA and\nIL-8RB) as well as sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel in three OVCA\ncell lines\n\nIn order to investigate the role of IL-8 expression in the acquisi-\ntion of the chemoresistance phenotype in OVCA cells, we first ana-\nlyzed the expression of IL-8 and its receptor (IL-8RA and IL-8RB) as\nwell as the response to cisplatin and paclitaxel in three OVCA cell\nlines. The secretion levels of IL-8 were significant various in three\nOVCA as shown in Fig. 1A. High and middle levels of IL-8 secretion\nwere observed in CAOV-3 (12298.40 \u00b1 305.47 pg/ml) and SKOV-3\n(715.92 \u00b1 35.28 pg/ml), respectively. However, no IL-8 was de-\ntected in the supernatant from A2780 cells. The mRNA levels of\nIL-8 resembled their respective protein levels in three OVCA cells\n(Fig. 1B). As determined by Western blot analysis, these three cell\nlines were demonstrated to express IL-8RA and IL-8RB (Fig. 1C).\nThe sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel also varied among these\ncell lines as shown in Fig. 1D and E. A2780 cells were the most sen-\nsitive (IC50 for cisplatin and paclitaxel were 8.06 \u00b1 0.49 lV and\n0.74 \u00b1 0.08 lV, respectively), whereas CAOV-3 (IC50 for cisplatin\nand paclitaxel were 74.40 \u00b1 0.82 lV and 9.65 \u00b1 0.35 lV, respec-\ntively) and SKOV-3 cells (IC50 for cisplatin and paclitaxel were\n66.19 \u00b1 3.42 lV and 6.67 \u00b1 0.17 lV, respectively), were drug-resis-\ntant (P < 0.001), indicating that autocrine production level of IL-8\nby OVCA cell lines were inversely associated with their sensitivity\nto cisplatin and paclitaxel. Taken together, these results suggest\nthat IL-8 receptor-bearing OVCA cell lines, A2780 (non-IL-8-\nexpressing and drug-sensitive) and CAOV-3 or SKOV-3 (IL-8-over-\nexpressing and drug-resistant) are the suitable cell models to\ninvestigate the effect of IL-8 on cisplatin- or paclitaxel-mediated\ncytotoxicity in OVCA cells.\n\n3.2. IL-8 confers cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in OVCA cells\n\nPrevious reports have suggested that elevated IL-8 expression\ncorrelates with poor prognosis [15,22] and chemosensitivity\n[19\u201322]. In correlation, our above results showed that autocrine\nproduction level of IL-8 by OVCA cell lines were inversely associ-\nated with their responsiveness to cisplatin and paclitaxel. It sug-\ngests that IL-8 could play a role in the resistance of OVCA cells to\nthe cytotoxic activities of anticancer compounds. To address this\nhypothesis, A2780 cells were cultured in the presence or absence\nof IL-8 for 10 days. After the pretreatment period, the cells were\nharvested, washed, and replated in the presence or absence of IL-\n8, and their resistance to cisplatin or paclitaxel was determined\nby the MTT assay [23,24]. Pretreatment of A2780 cells with IL-8\ncaused 6.07-fold and 7.23-fold increase in resistance to cisplatin\nand paclitaxel, respectively (P < 0.001, Fig. 2), indicating that the\npresence of exogenous IL-8 increased the resistance of OVCA cells\nto cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment.\n\n\n\nFig. 1.

Target protein levels were normalized against b-actin to control for\nvariance in sample loading and transfer. (D and E) Different responsiveness to cisplatin or paclitaxel in A2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells was assessed by the MTT assay. The\nexperiment shown is representative of three independent experiments with similar results.\n\n368 Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375\nTo determine whether the endogenous production of IL-8 by tu-\nmor cells could provide self-protection against drug-induced cell\ndeath, we constitutively expressed IL-8 in A2780 cells and inhib-\nited expression of IL-8 in SKOV-3 cells and examined the effect\nof IL-8 expression on the drug resistance of these cells. A2780 cells\nwere transfected with plasmid encoding for sense IL-8 and SKOV-3\ncells were transfected with plasmid encoding for antisense IL-8.\nStable A2780 (A2780/ssIL-8) and SKOV-3 (SKOV-3/asIL-8) transfec-\nted clones were isolated and screened for their ability to produce\nIL-8. Three representative clones that produced low (19.86 \u00b1\n6.24 pg/ml, A2780/ssIL-8L), middle (73.44 \u00b1 9.02 pg/ml, A2780/\nssIL-8 M) and high (101.81 \u00b1 13.01 pg/ml, A2780/ssIL-8H) levels\nof IL-8 (P < 0.001, Fig. 3A) and two representative clones that were\nmiddle (64.13%, SKOV-3/asIL-8 Mi) and high (77.52%, SKOV-3/asIL-\n8Hi) inhibition of IL-8 production (P < 0.001, Fig. 3C) compared\nwith the corresponding parental (i.e., untransfected) and control\nvector-transfected A2780 and SKOV-3 cells were chosen for subse-\nquent studies. The levels of IL-8 gene expression in the stable\ntransfected clones were also examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR\nanalysis. The levels of IL-8 mRNA were consistent with the secreted\nIL-8 levels in these stable transfected clones (Fig. 3B and D).\n\nTo determine whether the endogenous production of IL-8 in\nA2780 cells can confer resistance to drug treatment, we examined\nthe susceptibility or resistance of ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells to\ncisplatin or paclitaxel treatment using the MTT assay. As shown in\nFig.4A and B, A2780/ssIL-8L, A2780/ssIL-8M and A2780/ssIL-8H\ncells exhibited increased resistance to both cisplatin (6.49-fold,\n7.39-fold and 8.53-fold, respectively) and paclitaxel (6.36-fold,\n7.59-fold and 8.08-fold, respectively), as compared with\nparental A2780 cells (P < 0.001). Control A2780/pcDNA3.1(+) cells\nthat did not produce IL-8 exhibited similar drug sensitivity to\nparental A2780 cells (P > 0.05). These data suggest that over-\nexpressing of IL-8 confers a moderate level of drug resistance in\nOVCA cells.\n\nTo determine whether deleting of endogenous IL-8 in SKOV-3\ncells could increase their responsiveness to drug treatment, we\nalso examined the susceptibility or resistance of asIL-8-transfected\nSKOV-3 cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel. In correlation with data\nfrom ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells, SKOV-3/asIL-8Mi and SKOV-\n3/asIL-8Hi cells exhibited increased responsiveness to both cis-\nplatin (IC50 was 10.58 \u00b1 1.67 and 7.75 \u00b1 0.88 lV, respectively,\nFig. 4C) and paclitaxel (IC50 was 0.89 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.76 \u00b1 0.04 lV,\nrespectively, Fig. 4D) as compared with parental SKOV-3 (IC50 for\ncisplatin and paclitaxel were 66.50 \u00b1 3.42 and 6.79 \u00b1 0.45 lV,\nrespectively) and control SKOV-3/pcDNA3.1(+) cells (IC50 for cis-\nplatin and paclitaxel were 65.32 \u00b1 4.18 and 6.74 \u00b1 0.33 lV, respec-\ntively) (P < 0.001), which did not vary (P > 0.05). These results\nindicate that deleting of endogenous IL-8 by OVCA cells restores\ntheir response to chemotherapy.\n\nCaspase-3 plays a direct role in proteolytic cleavage of cellular\nproteins responsible for progression to apoptosis. To test whether\ncisplatin and paclitaxel resistance or susceptibility in ss/asIL-8-\ntransfected cells may have affected caspase-3 activity with cis-\nplatin or paclitaxel exposure, we measured caspase-3 activities in\nthese cells after exposure to two drugs. As shown in Fig. 5, there\nwas a significantly reduced level of caspase-3 in ssIL-8-transfected\nA2780 cells (P < 0.001, Fig. 5A and B), while there was a markedly\nincreased in asIL-8-transfected SKOV-3 cells (P < 0.001, Fig. 5C and\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Treatment with IL-8 increased the resistance of A2780 cells. A2780 cells\nwere cultured in the presence (A2780/preIL-8) or absence (A2780) of exogenous IL-\n8 for 10 days. After the pretreatment period, the cells were replated in the presence\nor absence of IL-8, and their resistance to cisplatin (A) or paclitaxel (B) was\ndetermined by the MTT assay. The experiment shown is representative of three\nindependent experiments with similar results.\n\nY.

IL-8 up-regulates MDR1 expression in OVCA cells\n\nCross-resistance to both cisplatin and paclitaxel suggests a mul-\ntidrug resistant phenotype possibly explained by drug transport or\nmetabolism, cellular repair or detoxification mechanisms. To eval-\nuate this possibility the expression of several genes already known\nto be involved in the mutidrug resistance phenomenon [MDR1,\nglutathione S transferase pi (GSTpi), multidrug resistance-associ-\nated protein (MRP), lung resistance-related protein (LRP) and topo-\nisomerase I (TopoI)] in above several OVCA cell lines was first\nmeasured by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis.\nThis analysis demonstrates that the mRNA and protein levels of\nMDR1, GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI (data not shown) are lower in\nA2780 cells, while those are higher in CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells,\nindicating that autocrine production levels of IL-8 by OVCA cell\nlines were consistent with the expression levels of above several\nputative resistance factors in these cells. To determine the effects\nof exogenous and endogenous IL-8 on mutidrug resistance-related\ngenes, we further studied IL-8-induced above several putative\nresistance factors expression of mRNA and protein in A2780 cells\ntreated with IL-8, ss/asIL-8-transfected cells and the corresponding\nuntransfected and control vector-transfected cells by semiquanti-\ntative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. IL-8 significantly up-reg-\nulated the mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 (Fig. 6A and B) but\nnot GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI (data not shown) in a dose-depen-\ndent manner in A2780 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of MDR1\n(Fig. 7A and B) but not GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI (data not shown)\nenhanced in ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells (Fig. 7A and B), and re-\nduced in asIL-8-transfected SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 7C and D) compared\nwith the corresponding parental and control vector-transfected\ncells, which had no difference. Therefore, these data suggest that\nIL-8 may confer cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in OVCA cells\nby increasing MDR1 expression.\n\n3.4. IL-8 up-regulates expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP in OVCA\ncells\n\nPrevious study demonstrated that the expression of apoptosis\ninhibitory proteins [36\u201339] may be an important mechanism\n0 and SKOV-3 cells and their transfectants.

The cells were treated with 10 lM cisplatin or 0.1 lM paclitaxel for 24 h. Caspase-3 activity was measured using\nthe caspase-3 colorimetric assay.

To determine\nthe another potential mechanism through which IL-8 causes\nchemotherapy resistance in OVCA cells, we also examined the\nexpression levels of several apoptosis inhibitory proteins in above\nseveral OVCA cell lines. The mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-\nxL, XIAP and survivin (data not shown), are lower in A2780 cells,\nwhereas those are higher in CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells, suggesting\nthat autocrine production levels of IL-8 by OVCA cell lines were\nalso in agreement with the expression levels of four apoptosis\ninhibitory proteins studied in these cells. To determine the effects\nof IL-8 on these apoptosis inhibitory proteins, we further studied\nIL-8-mediated mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP\n\n\n\nFig. 8.

IL-8 significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels\nof Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP (Fig. 6C and D) in a dose-dependent man-\nner, but had no effect on the mRNA and protein levels of survivin\n(data not shown) in A2780 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of\nBcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP (Fig. 8) but not survivin (data not shown)\nup-regulated in ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells (Fig. 8A and B),\nand down-regulated in as IL-8-transfected SKOV3 cells (Fig. 8C\nand D) compared with the corresponding untransfected and con-\ntrol vector-transfected cells, which did not vary. Taken together,\nthese results suggest that IL-8 may cause chemoresistance in OVCA\ncells by enhancing Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP expression.\n\n3.5. IL-8-induced chemoresistance to OVCA cells is through PI3K/Akt\nand Ras/MEK/ERK activation\n\nTo investigate what role PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways\nplay in the signal transduction of IL-8 in OVCA cells, we deter-\nmined the effects of wortmannin, a PI3 K specific inhibitor at 100\nor 200 nmol/L, and PD98059, a MEK1/2 specific inhibitor at 25 or\n50 lmol/L, on IL-8-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK and\nIL-8-induced cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance of A2780 cells. It\nwas found that wortmannin and PD98059 significantly antago-\nnized IL-8-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, respectively\n(Fig. 9A and B), and both of them blocked IL-8-induced cisplatin\nand paclitaxel resistance (Fig. 9C and D) and the inhibitory effects\nof wortmannin and PD98059 were dependent on its concentration.\nThese data confirm that activation of Akt and ERK are mediated by\nPI3 K- and MEK1/2-dependent mechanism, respectively, and\nsuggest that IL-8-induced cisplatin or paclitaxel resistance to OVCA\ncells is through activation of PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK.\nIn addition to detecting increased phosphorylation of Akt, in-\ncrease in Akt expression in A2780 cells was also indicated by den-\nsitometry analysis after stimulation with IL-8 (Fig. 9B). Therefore,\nour experiments indicate that IL-8 signaling increases both the\nactivation and the expression level of Akt in OVCA cells.\n4. Discussion\n\nIt has been widely reported that IL-8 is overexpressed in ovarian\ncyst fluid, ascites, serum, and tumor tissue from OVCA patients\n[11\u201322], and elevated IL-8 expression correlates with a poor final\noutcome [15,22] and chemosensitivity [19\u201322]. Previous work\nfrom our group and others has shown that IL-8 promotes OVCA cell\ngrowth [22\u201324,27]. In the present study, we first demonstrated\nthat autocrine production level of IL-8 by OVCA cell lines, including\nA2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3, is inversely associated with their re-\nsponse to cisplatin and paclitaxel. Some studies have consistently\ndemonstrated that CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells are resistant to cis-\nplatin, while A2780 cells are responsive [40,41]. Our data further\ndemonstrated that CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells were also paclit-\naxel-resistant and A2780 cells were paclitaxel-sensitive. Further-\nmore, we found that CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells produced higher\nlevels of IL-8, while A2780 cells do not. Notably, we also observed\nthat A2780 cells expressed IL-8 receptor, though they did not se-\ncrete IL-8, suggesting that the expression of IL-8 receptor by OVCA\ncells could be not associated with their IL-8 production status.\nTherefore, IL-8 receptor-bearing OVCA cell lines, non-IL-8-express-\ning and cisplatin/paclitaxel-responsive A2780, and IL-8-over-\nexpressing and cisplatin/paclitaxel-resistant CAOV-3 or SKOV-3\nwere used to study the effect of IL-8 on multidrug resistance, but\nin our study, A2780 and SKOV-3 cell lines were chosen as suitable\ncell models.\n\n\n\nFig. 9. Effects of wortmannin or PD98059 on IL-8-induced phosphorylation of Akt or ERK in A2780 cells and IL-8-mediated cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance to A2780 cells\npretreated with IL-8 (A2780/preIL-8). The cells were pretreated with wortmannin (100 or 200 nM), PD98059 (25 or 50 lM) or DMSO of equal volume for 30 min at 37 \ufffdC\nbefore IL-8 was added into the medium. (A and B) A2780 cells were cultured for 6 h in the presence of IL-8. After the cells were collected and washed, whole-cell extracts were\nprepared and subjected to Western blot assay. (C and D) The cells were seeded into 96-well plate (4 \ufffd 104 cells per well) and cultured in the presence of IL-8 (50 ng/ml) and\ncisplatin (1 or 10 lM) or paclitaxel (0.01 or 0.1 lM) for 48 h. Afterwards, MTT assay was performed to determine the effect of wortmannin and PD98059 on IL-8-induced\ncisplatin or paclitaxe resistance to A2780 cells pretreated with IL-8 (A2780/preIL-8). The experiment shown is the average data of three independent experiments. \u2044P > 0.05,\ncompared with control; \u2044\u2044P < 0.001, compared with cisplatin or paclitaxel (no inhibitors).\n\nY. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375 373\nSeveral recent studies have addressed the role of IL-8 in tumor\ncell chemoresistance, including in melanoma [42], colorectal can-\ncer [43], renal cell carcinoma [44], and prostate cancer [45,46].\nHowever, the role of IL-8 expression in the acquisition of the mul-\ntidrug resistance phenotype in OVCA has not been investigated.\nHere we show that both exogenous (a relatively short period of\ntreatment with recombination IL-8) and endogenous IL-8 (by\ntransfecting with plasmid encoding for sense IL-8) induce cisplatin\nand paclitaxel resistance in non-IL-8-producing A2780 cells,\nwhereas deleting of endogenous IL-8 expression in IL-8-over-\nexpressing SKOV-3 cells (by transfecting with plasmid encoding\nfor antisense IL-8) promotes the sensitivity of these cells to anti-\ncancer drugs. Meanwhile, we confirm that IL-8-mediated resis-\ntance of OVCA cells exhibits decreased proteolytic activation of\ncaspase-3. These findings suggest that the production of IL-8 pro-\ntects the cells from cytotoxic agents through down-regulation of\nproteolytic activation of caspase-3 and expression level of IL-8 is\npositively associated with their degree of chemoresistance in OVCA\ncells. Other studies have shown that transfection of IL-8 into colo-\nrectal cancer [43] or prostate cancer cell line [45] causes drug resis-\ntance and inhibition of IL-8 overexpression in colorectal cancer\n[43] or prostate cancer [45,46] cell lines with small interfering\nRNA (siRNA) increases the sensitivity of these cells to anticancer\ndrugs. Thus, some tumor cells may acquire the ability to express\nand produce IL-8 as a protective mechanism against drug induced\ndeath. The stimuli responsible for the constitutive expression of IL-\n8 in chemoresistant cells are not yet fully understood. Previous\nfindings have suggested that expression of IL-8 is regulated by a\nnumber of different stimuli including inflammatory signals (e.g.,\ntumor necrosis factor a, IL-1b), chemical and environmental\nstresses (e.g., exposure to chemotherapy agents and hypoxia),\nand steroid hormones (e.g., androgens, estrogens, and dexametha-\nsone; reviewed in Ref. [47]). These stimuli may be associated with\nthe constitutive expression of IL-8 in chemoresistant cells, but fur-\nther experiments need to be done to determine this presumption.\n\nIn OVCA, up to two-thirds tumor specimens have been found to\noverexpress MDR1 (also known as ABCB1, which encodes the P-\nglycoprotein) on immunohistochemistry [48\u201350], and this overex-\npression has been shown in some cases to correlate with poor\noverall survival and chemotherapy resistance. Recently studies\nhave shown that inhibition of MDR1 expression by siRNA in human\nmultidrug resistant OVCA cell lines enhances the intracellular\naccumulation of and restored sensitivity to cisplatin [51]. The re-\nsults of the many studies cited above suggests that MDR1 play\nan important role in the mechanisms responsible for chemoresis-\ntance of OVCA cells. Here we demonstrate that IL-8 regulates\nexpression of MDR1 but not GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI in OVCA\ncells, in correlation, increases the resistance of the cells to cis-\nplatin/paclitaxel treatment. Thus, the regulation of MDR1 gene\nexpression is a potential mechanism by which IL-8 provides drug\nprotection. In this study, we first demonstrate that IL-8 up-regu-\nlates MDR1 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner in OVCA\ncells.\n\nA number of studies have shown that the anti-apoptotic ability\nof IL-8 was associated with expression of the Bcl-2 and Inhibitor of\nApoptosis (IAP) families proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin\n[46,52]. Bcl-2 [36], Bcl-xL [37], survivin [38] and XIAP [39] have\nbeen shown in OVCA to be associated with resistance to chemo-\ntherapy. Thus, we investigated whether IL-8 alters the expression\nof apoptosis inhibitory proteins as a mechanism of drug resistance.\nWe found that IL-8 increased expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP\nbut not survivin in a dose-dependent manner in OVCA cells as a\n\n\n\n374 Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375\nmechanism of drug resistance. The enhancement of Bcl-2 and\nBcl-xL expression by IL-8 in OVCA cells is in accordance with the\nresults of Singh et al. [46] in prostate cancer cell line. While our\nfindings that survivin levels are not altered by IL-8 in OVCA cells\nis different from the results of Wilson et al. [52], who have reported\nthat stimulation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells\nwith IL-8 increases the transcription and expression of survivin.\nHere we provide the first evidence that IL-8 may up-regulates XIAP\nexpression in a dose-dependent manner in OVCA cells.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence implicated that the activation of PI3\nK/Akt [28\u201331] and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK [32\u201334], the most important\ncell survival signalings, protects OVCA cells from chemotherapy.\nIt has reported that Akt inactivation sensitizes human OVCA cells\nto cisplatin [28] and paclitaxel [29]. Moreover, the inactivation of\na downstream targets of the PI3 K/Akt pathway, such as BAD [28]\nand the transcription factors of Forkhead [53] and NFjB [54], also\nsensitize human OVCA cells to cisplatin in vitro. Finally, Akt inacti-\nvation by a PI3 K inhibitor also enhances the sensitivity of OVCA to\ncisplatin [28] and paclitaxel [29] in vivo. It has been shown that cis-\nplatin treatment activates ERK in OVCA cells and that activation of\nERK protects OVCA cells from cisplatin-induced death [32\u201334].\nFurthermore, inhibition of ERK signaling by the MEK1/2 inhibitor\nPD98059 blocked ERK activation and increased cisplatin sensitivity\nin SKOV-3 cells [33]. In this study, IL-8-induced activation of ERK\nand Akt in OVCA cells is blocked by their specific inhibitors to sig-\nnal transducers, which inhibit IL-8-induced cisplatin and paclitaxel\nresistance of OVCA cells. Also, we interestingly find that IL-8 in-\ncreases not only phosphorylation of Akt but expression of Akt in\nOVCA cells, which is in accordance with the result of MacManus\net al. [55] in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our data suggest\nthat IL-8 promotes chemoresistance of OVCA cells via activation of\nmultiple signal transduction pathways including PI3 K/Akt path-\nway and ERK cascade. In toto, these results provide support for\nthese signal transduction pathways as a strategy for reversing drug\nresistance.\n\nIn summary, we conclude that IL-8 secreted by OVCA cells may\ncontribute to the refractoriness of these cells to conventional che-\nmotherapy through down-regulation of proteolytic activation of\ncaspase-3. Furthermore, IL-8-induced chemoresistance may be\nassociated with increase of both multidrug resistance-related\ngenes (MDR1) and apoptosis inhibitory proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL\nand XIAP), as well as activation of PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK.\nTherefore, modulation of IL-8 expression or its related signaling\npathway may be a promising strategy of treatment for drug-resis-\ntant OVCA.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by Grants from the National Natural\nScience Foundation of China (No. 81041071), Tianjin Municipal Sci-\nence and Technology Commission (No. 08JCYBJC06900), Postdoc-\ntoral Science Foundation of China (No. 20080441340) and\nProgram for Science and Technology in Medical College of Chinese\nPeople\u2019s Armed Police Forces (No. WYM201105, WY200914).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Risch HA.
