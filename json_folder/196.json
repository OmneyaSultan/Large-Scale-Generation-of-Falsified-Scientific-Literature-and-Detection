Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members \nof the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily of signaling molecules and have \npreviously been shown to be associated with the biological \nbehavior of osteosarcoma. However, to date the effects and \nmolecular mechanisms of BMP-9 on osteosarcoma progression \nare unknown. We performed real-time PCR and western blot \nanalysis to characterize the endogenous expression of BMP-9 \nin osteosarcoma cell lines. We used a recombinant adenovirus \nexpressing BMP-9 (adBMP-9) to infect osteosarcoma cell lines \nwith relatively low endogenous BMP-9 expression to determine \nthe functional relevance of BMP-9 overexpression to osteosar-\ncoma cell growth and migration in vitro and in vivo, and further \ninvestigated the expression levels of Ki-67, matrix metallopep-\ntidase-9 (MMP-9), phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85\u03b1 (PI3Kp85\u03b1) \nand phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT). As a result, osteosarcoma \ncell proliferation and migration were significantly diminished \nby adBMP-9, indicated by MTT and wound-healing assays, \nand cell apoptosis was markedly induced, indicated by Hoechst \n33342/PI assay and Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection. When \nBMP-9 expression was enhanced, the expression of PI3Kp85\u03b1, \np-AKT, Ki-67 and MMP-9 was downregulated in osteosarcoma \ncells. In addition, the tumor volumes in MG-63 and HOS \nsubcutaneous nude mouse models treated with adBMP-9 were \nsignificantly smaller compared to those of the ad-GFP group. \nThese results suggested that the enhanced expression of BMP-9 \nin osteosarcoma cells by adBMP-9 exerted inhibitory effects \non growth and migration of osteosarcoma cells possibly via \nblockade of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOsteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone \ntumor, accounting for approximately 20% of all primary \nsarcomas in bone. Although treatment modalities have been \nimproved over the past decades, it is still a tumor with a high \nmortality rate ascribed to tumor cell invasion and metastasis (1). \nBone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a group of the most \npowerful bone inductive factors enriched in the bone matrix, \nhave been indicated in osteosarcoma and its metastasis.\n\nBMP belongs to the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 super-\nfamily. BMP signaling in diseases is the subject of a large \nquantity of studies, and has already been shown to play a vital \nrole in the development and progression of cancer (2,3). The \npresence of BMPs in osteosarcoma has been verified and the \nrole of BMPs in osteosarcoma has also been widely investigated. \nStudies demonstrated that seven BMPs (BMP 2-8) and all \ntheir receptors were simultaneously expressed in osteosarcoma \ncells (4) and osteosarcomas producing BMPs contained less-\ndifferentiated mesenchymal cells, resulting in a poorer prognosis \nfor those patients (5). BMP 2-8 were all expressed in osteosar-\ncomas, of which BMP 6-8 were highly expressed and BMP-6 \ncorrelated with a chondroid differentiation (6). BMP-2 promoted \nmigration of osteosarcom cells by enhancing incorporation of \nintegrin-\u03b2 (7), and may be an important factor in the metastasis \nof osteosarcoma. A recent study indicated that inhibition of \nBMPs could be investigated as a possible strategy for decreasing \nthe incidence of pulmonary metastases in osteosarcoma (8).\n\nBMP-9 has been shown as a pleiotropic cytokine, which is \nimplicated in a number of physiologic events. These include \nbone morphogenesis, functions of hepatic reticuloendothelial \nsystem, hematopoiesis, neuronal differentiation, glucose homeo-\nstasis, iron homeostasis, and angiogenesis (9-15). Although the \nexpression of BMP-9 was initially thought to be restricted to \nthe liver, it has been shown that BMP-9 binds with high affinity \nto activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and endoglin in endo-\nthelial cells, and induces phosphorylation of Smad-1/5/8 (16). \nThis signaling inhibits basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated \nproliferation and migration of bovine aortic endothelial cells \nand VEGF-induced angiogenesis (17). BMP-9 also inhibits \nthe migration and growth of human dermal microvascular \nendothelial cells (15) and the DNA synthesis of human aortic \n\nAdenovirus-mediated overexpression of BMP-9 inhibits \nhuman osteosarcoma cell growth and migration through \n\ndownregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway\nBO LI*,  YUEHUA YANG*,  SHENGDAN JIANG,  BINBIN NI,  KE CHEN  and  LEISHENG JIANG\n\nDepartment of Orthopedic Surgery, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, \nSchool of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, P.R.

BMP-9 has been reported to \ninduce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and prevent the migra-\ntion and invasiveness of prostate cancer (19). However, the roles \nplayed by this cytokine in osteosarcoma have not been explored. \nIn the present study, the endogenous expression of BMP-9 was \nexamined in osteosarcoma cell lines. The biological function \nof this molecule was investigated in cells that overexpress this \nmolecule in order to establish the functional role of BMP-9 in \nosteosarcoma cells. Finally, the underlying signaling pathway \ninvolved in the progression of osteosarcoma was explored.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nMaterials. MG-63, U-2 and HOS osteosarcoma cell lines used \nin the experiment were from Institute of Biochemistry and \nCell Biology (Shanghai, China). Fifteen 6-week-old female \nimmune-deficient nude mice (BALB/c-nu) were purchased \nfrom Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd (Shanghai, \nChina). AdBMP-9 adenovirus vector, negative control vector \nad-GFP and virion-packaging elements were from Genechem \n(Shanghai, China). The primers of BMP-9, PI3Kp85\u03b1 and \np-AKT, GAPDH, were synthesized by ABI Co. Ltd (USA). All \nantibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, \nCA, USA).\n\nDrugs and reagents. 3-(4,5)-Dimethylthiahiazo(-z-yl)-3,5-di-\nphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was from Dingguo biology \n(Shanghai, China); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium \n(DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Thermo \nFisher Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA); TRIzol Reagent and \nLipofectamine 2000 were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA); \nM-MLV Reverse Transcriptase was from Promega (Madison, \nWI, USA); SYBR-Green Master mixture was from Takara \n(Otsu, Japan); RNase A and double stain apoptosis detection kit \n(Hoechst 33342/PI) were from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, \nGermany) and Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit I from \nBD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA, USA). ECL-PLUS/Kit was \nfrom GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA).\n\nCell culture and adenovirus transfection. MG-63 and HOS \nosteosarcoma cell lines were cultured in DMEM medium \nsupplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml \nof penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml of streptomycin. They were all \nplaced in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37\u02daC. \nRecombinant adenovirus vector adBMP-9 and negative control \nad-GFP were transfected into MG-63 and HOS osteosarcoma \ncell lines. Cells were subcultured at a 1:5 dilution in 300 \u00b5g/ml \nG418-containing medium. Positive stable transfectants were \nselected and expanded for further study. The clone in which \nthe adBMP-9 adenovirus vectors were transfected was named \nas adBMP-9 group, the negative control vectors as the ad-GFP \ngroup and MG-63 or HOS osteosarcoma cells without gene \ntransfection as the CON group.\n\nReal-time PCR. To quantitatively determine the mRNA expres-\nsion levels of BMP-9, PI3Kp85\u03b1 and p-AKT in osteosarcoma \ncell lines, real-time PCR was used. Total-RNA of each clone \nwas extracted with TRIzol according to the manufacturer's \nprotocol. Reverse-transcription was carried out using M-MLV \nand cDNA amplification was carried out using SYBR-Green \n\nMaster mix kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The \ngenes were amplified using specific oligonucleotide primer and \nhuman glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) \ngene was used as an endogenous control. The PCR primer \nsequences were as follows: BMP-9, 5'-TTCCTTCAGAGC \nAAACAGCA-3' and 5'-GTTGTGCTCAAATCCCCATT-3'; \nPI3Kp85\u03b1, 5'-GAAAGGAGGAAAUAACAAAdtdt-3' and \n5'-UUUGUUAUUUCCUCCUUUCdtdt-3'; p-AKT, 5'-GGAG \nAUCAUGCAGCAUCGCdtdt-3' and 5'-GCGAUGCUGCA \nUGAUCUCCdtdt-3'; GAPDH, 5'-CAACGAATTTGGCTAC \nAGCA-3' and 5'-AGGGGTCTACATGGCAACTG-3'. Data \nwere analyzed using the comparative Ct method (2-\u2206\u2206Ct). Three \nseparate experiments were performed for each clone.\n\nWestern blot assay. Osteosarcoma cells were harvested and \nextracted using lysis buffer (Tris-HCl, SDS, mercaptoethanol, \nglycerol). Cell extracts were boiled for 5 min in loading \nbuffer and then equal amount of cell extracts were separated \non 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Separated protein bands were trans-\nferred into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes and \nthe membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk powder. The \nprimary antibodies against BMP-9, PI3Kp85\u03b1, p-AKT, Ki-67 \nand MMP-9 were diluted according to the instructions of \nantibodies and incubated overnight at 4\u02daC. Then, horseradish \nperoxidase-linked secondary antibodies were added at a dilu-\ntion ratio of 1:1,000 and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. \nThe membranes were washed with PBS three times and the \nimmunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL-PLUS/Kit \naccording to the kit instructions. The relative protein level in \ndifferent cell lines was normalized to GAPDH concentration. \nThree separate experiments were performed for each clone.\n\nCell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was analyzed with \nthe MTT assay. Briefly, cells infected with AdBMP-9 were \nincubated in 96-well plates at a density of 1x105 cells per well \nwith DEME medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells \nwere treated with 20 \u00b5l MTT dye at 0, 24, 48, 72 h and then \nincubated with 150 \u00b5l of DMSO for 5 min. The color reaction \nwas measured at 570 nm with enzyme immunoassay analyzer \n(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The proliferative activities were \ncalculated for each clone.\n\nWound-healing assay. MG-63 and HOS osteosarcoma cells \nwere plated in each well of a 6-well culture plate and allowed \nto grow to 90% confluence. Treatment with adBMP-9 was \nthen performed. The next day, a wound was created using a \nmicropipette tip. The migration of cells towards the wound was \nmonitored daily, and images were captured at time intervals of \n24 h.\n\nHoechst 33342/PI assay. This assay was performed according to \na combination of methods with modifications as detailed: 50 \u00b5l/\nwell of a 200 \u00b5g/ml PI stock and 2.5 \u00b5l of a 100 \u00b5g/ml Hoechst \n33342 was added to a microtitre plate volume of 100 \u00b5l and \nincubated in the dark for 60 and 15 min, respectively. A 100 \u00b5l \nof methanol:acetic acid (3:1) fixative was then added directly \nto each well. Cells were viewed under a UV microscope with \nDAPI filter. Six replicate wells were analyzed for each treatment \nby quantitative and qualitative examination of four random \nfields in each well.\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  41:  1809-1819,  2012 1811\n\nDetection of apoptosis incidence by flow cytometry. Apoptosis \nincidence was detected by the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis \ndetection kit I (BD Pharmingen). Briefly, cells that were \nattached to the plate as well as those present in the super-\nnatant were collected together and re-suspended in binding \nbuffer at a concentration of 1x106 cells/ml. A 100 \u00b5l sample \nof solution containing 1x105 cells was incubated with 5 \u00b5l of \nAnnexin V-FITC and 5 \u00b5l of propidium iodide for 15 min at \nroom temperature in the dark, followed by addition of 400 \u00b5l \nof binding buffer. Samples were analyzed by a fluorescence-\nactivated cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA) \nwithin 1 h. Apoptotic cells, including those staining positive \nfor Annexin V-FITC and negative for propidium iodide and \nthose that were double positive, were counted and reported as \na percentage of the total cell count.\n\nIn vivo tumor xenograft studies. The animal experiments and \nprotocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional \nAnimal Care and Use Committee of the Shanghai Jiao Tong \nUniversity School of Medicine. Six mice were injected subcu-\ntaneously with 1x108 MG-63 and HOS osteosarcoma cells \nin 50 \u00b5l of PBS pre-mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel \nmatrix (Becton-Dickinson). Mice were monitored daily and all \nmice developed a subcutaneous tumor. When the tumor size \nreached approximately 5 mm in length, they were surgically \n\nremoved, cut into 1-2 mm3 pieces, and re-seeded individually \ninto other twelve mice. When tumor size reached approximately \n5 mm in length, the mice were randomly assigned to ad-BMP-9 \nand ad-GFP groups, in which 15 \u00b5l of adenovirus was injected \ninto the subcutaneous tumors using a multi-site injection format. \nInjections were repeated on the third day after initial treatment. \nThe tumor volume every three days was measured with a caliper, \nusing the formula volume = (length x width)2/2.\n\nStatistical analysis. The results obtained were expressed as \nthe mean \u00b1 SE from at least three independent experiments. \nOne-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze \nthe differences between groups. The LSD method of multiple \ncomparisons was used when the probability for ANOVA was \nstatistically significant. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.\n\nResults\n\nThe endogenous expression of BMP-9 in osteosarcoma cell \nlines. The endogenous expression of BMP-9 in human MG-63, \nU-2 and HOS osteosarcoma cell lines was evaluated using \nRT-PCR and western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, there \nwere different levels of mRNA and protein expression of \nBMP-9 in MG-63, U-2 and HOS osteosarcoma cell lines, but \nthe expression levels of BMP-9 were significantly higher in U-2 \n\nFigure 1. The endogenous expression of BMP-9 in osteosarcoma cell lines. There were different levels of (A) mRNA and (B) protein expression of BMP-9 in \nMG-63, U-2 and HOS cell lines, but the expression levels of BMP-9 were significantly higher in U-2 cell line than those in MG-63 and HOS cell lines, indicated \nby real-time PCR and western blot assays.\n\n\n\nLI et al:  INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF BMP-9 ON OSTEOSARCOMA1812\n\ncell line than in MG-63 and HOS cell lines.

(B) Constructed adenovirus vector \nadBMP-9 was used for infecting the MG-63 and HOS cell lines. The infection efficiency of adBMP-9 (MOI=100) in MG-63 and HOS cell lines was greater than \n80% under fluorescence microscopy. (A) Real-time PCR and (C and D) western blot assays were performed at 48-h recovery to measure the exogenous expression \nof BMP-9, PI3Kp85\u03b1 and p-AKT, showing that an obvious increase of BMP-9 expression was observed in adBMP-9 group compared with the ad-GFP group and \nCON group (**P<0.01), while a marked decrease of PI3Kp85\u03b1 and p-AKT expression was found in adBMP-9 group compared with the ad-GFP group and CON \ngroup in MG-63 and HOS cell lines (**P<0.01). No difference was found between ad-GFP group and CON group in MG-63 and HOS cell lines (P>0.05).\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  41:  1809-1819,  2012 1813\n\nlow endogenous BMP-9 expression, constructed adenovirus \nvector adBMP-9 was used for infecting the MG-63 and HOS \ncell lines. In pilot studies, the infection efficiency of adBMP-9 \n(MOI=100) in MG-63 and HOS cell lines was greater than 80% \nunder fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2B). Real-time PCR and \nwestern blot assays were performed at 48 h recovery to measure \nthe exogenous expression of BMP-9, PI3Kp85\u03b1 and p-AKT. \nAn obvious increase of BMP-9 expression was observed in \nadBMP-9 group compared with the ad-GFP group and CON \ngroup (**P<0.01), while a marked decrease of PI3Kp85\u03b1 and \np-AKT expression was found in adBMP-9 group compared \nwith the ad-GFP group and CON group in MG-63 and HOS \ncell lines (**P<0.01) (Fig. 2A, C and D), but no difference was \nfound between ad-GFP group and CON group in MG-63 and \nHOS cell lines (P>0.05). These data indicated that overexpres-\n\nsion of BMP-9 might block the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in \nosteosarcoma cells.\n\nInhibition of osteosarcoma cell proliferation by adBMP-9. \nDeregulated cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer (20). In \norder to detect the effect of adBMP-9 on osteosarcoma cell \nproliferation, we investigated the proliferative activities of \nMG-63 and HOS cell lines by MTT. As a result, it was indicated \nthat adBMP-9 significantly reduced the proliferative activities of \nMG-63 and HOS cell lines in a time-dependent manner \ncompared with the ad-GFP group and CON group. No difference \nwas found between ad-GFP group and CON group in MG-63 \nand HOS cell lines (Fig. 3A and B). In addition, Ki-67 is at the \nvery heart of many essential cellular processes and determines \nthe tumor progression and the outcome of anticancer treatment. \n\nFigure 3. Inhibition of osteosarcoma cell proliferation by adBMP-9 in MG-63 and HOS cell lines. (A and B) It was indicated by MTT assay that adBMP-9 signifi-\ncantly reduced the proliferative activities of MG-63 and HOS cell lines in a time-dependent manner compared with the ad-GFP group and CON group. No difference \nwas found between ad-GFP group and CON group in MG-63 and HOS cell lines. (C and D) The expression of Ki-67 was examined by western blot assay, indicating \nthat the amount of Ki-67 expression was significantly decreased in adBMP-9 group compared with the ad-GFP group and CON group in MG-63 and HOS cell lines. \nNo difference was found between ad-GFP group and CON group.\n\n\n\nLI et al:  INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF BMP-9 ON OSTEOSARCOMA1814\n\nTo determine whether BMP-9 overexpression suppressed the \nendogenous Ki-67 through translational repression, the expres-\nsion of Ki-67 was examined by western blot assay, indicating that \nthe amount of Ki-67 expression was significantly decreased in \nadBMP-9 group compared with the ad-GFP group and CON \n\ngroup in MG-63 and HOS cell lines (Fig. 3C and D). No differ-\nence was found between ad-GFP group and CON group in \nMG-63 and HOS cell lines. The results suggested that over-\nexpression of BMP-9 might inhibit osteosarcoma cell \nproliferation via downregulation of Ki-67 expression.\n\nFigure 4. Inhibition of osteosarcoma cell migration by adBMP-9 in MG-63 and HOS cell lines. (A) Wound-healing assay showed that the migration capacity of OS \ncells in adBMP-9 group was markedly lower than those in ad-GFP group and CON group. No difference was found between ad-GFP group and CON group. (B and \nC) Western blot assay was performed to examine the effect of adBMP-9 on MMP-9 expression, showing that the expression of MMP-9 protein was significantly \ninhibited in adBMP-9 group compared with the ad-GFP group and CON group in MG-63 and HOS cell lines. No difference was found between ad-GFP group \nand CON group.\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  41:  1809-1819,  2012 1815\n\nInhibition of osteosarcoma cell migration by adBMP-9. \nTo determine the effect of adBMP-9 on MG-63 and HOS \ncell migration, wound-healing assay was performed which \nshowed that the migration capacity of the osteosarcoma cells \nin adBMP-9 group were markedly lower than those in ad-GFP \ngroup and CON group, but no significant changes were found \nbetween ad-GFP group and CON group (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, \nwestern blot assay was used to examine the effect of adBMP-9 \non MMP-9 expression. As shown in Fig. 4B and C, the expres-\nsion of MMP-9 protein was significantly inhibited in adBMP-9 \ngroup compared with the ad-GFP group and CON group in \nMG-63 and HOS cell lines. No difference was found between \nad-GFP group and CON group. These data suggested that \noverexpression of BMP-9 might inhibit cell migration via down-\nregulation of MMP-9 expression.\n\nInduction of osteosarcoma cell apoptosis by adBMP-9. It has \nbeen shown that the action mechanism of many anticancer \nfactors is based on their ability to induce apoptosis. Therefore, \nit was desirable that MG-63 and HOS osteosarcoma cells \ntreated with adBMP-9 underwent apoptosis as their mode of \n\ncell death. At the end of the incubation period for 24, 48 and \n72 h, the osteosarcoma cells were stained with Hoechst \n33342/PI double staining and their cell nucleus was observed \nunder the microscope for apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5A, the \nnumber of MG-63 and HOS apoptotic cells (weak red and \nstrong blue staining) and necrotic cells (strong red and strong \nblue staining) in adBMP-9 group significantly increased \ncompared with that in the ad-GFP group and CON group (weak \nred and weak blue staining) in a time-dependent manner. As \nshown in Fig. 5B, the apoptotic indexes of MG-63 and HOS \ncells in adBMP-9 group were also significantly higher than \nthose in ad-GFP group and CON group (*P<0.05, **P<0.01). \nHowever, no difference was found between ad-GFP group and \nCON group (P>0.05). The apoptotic incidence was also \nobserved by flow cytometry at 24 h after the transfection \n(Fig. 6A and B) and the result showed that the incidence of \napoptotic cells significantly increased in adBMP-9 group \ncompared with that in the ad-GFP group and CON group \n(**P<0.01), but no difference was found between ad-GFP group \nand CON group (P>0.05). These data suggested that over-\nexpression of BMP-9 could induce osteosarcoma cell apoptosis.\n\nFigure 5. Induction of osteosarcoma cell apoptosis by adBMP-9 in MG-63 and HOS cell lines. (A) At the end of the incubation period for 24, 48 and 72 h, the \nMG-63 and HOS cells were stained with Hoechst 33342/PI double staining and their cell nucleus was observed under microscopy for apoptosis, showing that \nthe number of MG-63 and HOS apoptotic cells (weak red and strong blue staining) and necrotic cells (strong red and strong blue staining) in adBMP-9 group \nsignificantly increased compared with that in the ad-GFP group and CON group (weak red and week blue staining) in a time dependent manner. (B) The apoptotic \nindex of MG-63 and HOS cells in adBMP-9 group was significantly higher than that in ad-GFP group and CON group (*P<0.05, **P<0.01), but no difference was \nfound between ad-GFP group and CON group (P>0.05).\n\n\n\nLI et al:  INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF BMP-9 ON OSTEOSARCOMA1816\n\nAntitumor effect of adBMP-9 in the osteosarcoma xenograft \nmodel. Our in vitro experiments confirmed that adBMP-9 effi-\nciently inhibited the growth and migration of MG-63 and HOS \ncells. Whether BMP-9 has the same inhibitory effect on in vivo \nosteosarcoma was not known. Therefore, we further investigated \nthe antitumor effect of adBMP-9 in vivo using MG-63 and HOS \nxenograft models. The mean volumes of MG-63 and HOS xeno-\ngraft tumors were 70.21\u00b115.30 mm3 and 75.45\u00b118.29 mm3 in the \nexperimental mice before treatment. At the 14th day, the average \nvolumes of MG-63 and HOS xenograft tumors were measured \n\nand found significantly smaller in adBMP-9 group than those \nin the ad-GFP group (Fig. 7A and B). During the whole tumor \ngrowth period, the tumor growth activity was measured. The \ntumors treated with adBMP-9 grew substantially slower than the \nad-GFP group (Fig. 7C and D). When the tumors were harvested, \nthe average weights of MG-63 and HOS xenograft tumors in \nadBMP-9 group were significantly lighter than those in the \nad-GFP group (**P<0.01) (Fig. 7E and F). These results in vivo \nindicated that overexpression of BMP-9 could inhibit MG-63 \nand HOS cell growth.\n\nFigure 6. Evaluation of apoptotic incidence by flow cytometry. (A) Representative graphs obtained by flow cytometry analysis after double staining with \nAnnexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. Undamaged cells were stained with negative Annexin V-FITC/PI (bottom left quadrant). (B) The apoptotic incidence of \nMG-63 and HOS cells at the 24 h after transfection. The frequency of apoptotic cells significantly increased in adBMP-9 group compared with that in the ad-GFP \ngroup and CON group (**P<0.01), but no difference was found between ad-GFP group and CON group (P>0.05).\n\n  A\n\n  B\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  41:  1809-1819,  2012 1817\n\nDiscussion\n\nBMPs are multifunctional cytokines that regulate the growth, \ndifferentiation and apoptosis of various cell types (21). BMP \nhas also been proved to be one of the significant factors in the \nprognosis of bone tumors (22), and detection of BMPs in osteo-\nsarcoma has been reported in several studies (23-25).\n\nThe BMP-2/4, BMP-3, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7 and BMP-8 \nwere previously found highly expressed in osteosarcoma \ntissues (6), but BMP-9 expression in osteosarcoma has not \nbeen reported. Our study documented for the first time the \nendogenous expression of BMP-9 in MG-63, U-2 and HOS \nosteosarcoma cells, and demonstrated that the expression level \nof BMP-9 was significantly higher in U-2 cell line than that in \nMG-63 and HOS cell lines, which were chosen for infection \nby the adBMP-9 adenovirus. In pilot studies, the infectious \n\nefficiency of adBMP-9 in MG-63 and HOS cell lines was \nvery high, and an obvious increase of BMP-9 expression was \nobserved in adBMP-9 group compared with the ad-GFP group \nand CON group.\n\nStudies have shown that BMP-9 is also produced by \nhepatocytes and circulates mainly in an active mature form \ncomplexed to its prodomain (26), and induces proliferation \nof multiple types of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo (27). \nIn contrast, we found in our study that the overexpression of \nBMP-9 significantly reduced the proliferative activities of \nMG-63 and HOS cell lines in a time-dependent manner. More \nimportantly, BMP-9 has been confirmed to prevent the migra-\ntion and invasiveness and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer, \nwhich suggests that BMP-9 may be considered as a tumor \nsuppressor and apoptosis regulator in prostate cancer (19). \nAdditionally, soluble endoglin can specifically binds BMP-9 \n\nFigure 7. Antitumor effect of adBMP-9 in the osteosarcoma MG-63 and HOS xenograft models. (A and B) At the 14th day, the average volumes of MG-63 \nand HOS xenograft tumors were measured and found significantly smaller in adBMP-9 group than those in the ad-GFP group. (C and D) During the whole \ntumor growth period, the tumor growth activity was measured, showing that the tumors treated with adBMP-9 grew substantially slower than the ad-GFP \ngroup. (E and F) At the 14th day, the average weights of MG-63 and HOS xenograft tumors were significantly lower in adBMP-9 group than those in the \nad-GFP group (**P<0.01).\n\n\n\nLI et al:  INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF BMP-9 ON OSTEOSARCOMA1818\n\nvia its orphan domain, inhibits blood vessel formation and \nsuppresses tumor growth (28). By contrast, BMP-9 was \nalso reported to promote ovarian cancer cell proliferation \nthrough ALK-2/Smad1/Smad4 pathway (29). We think that \nthe response to BMP-9 is not accordant among all cancers. \nThe biological response of cancer cells to BMP-9 may depend \nnot only on the particular cell type or concentration of BMP \nused, but also on the presence of other factors that are not \nyet defined. Our gain-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo \nusing adBMP-9 revealed significant decrease in growth and \nmigration and increase in apoptosis in MG-63 and HOS cells, \nsuggesting that BMP-9 may function as a tumor suppressor in \nosteosarcoma.\n\nPI3K/AKT is a major pathway for malignant progression in \nvarious tumors. It is involved in mediating survival signals that \nrescue Ewing tumor from fibroblast growth factor 2-induced \ncell death (30). Blockade of Ras/PI3K/AKT pathways by statins \nreduces the expression of TGF-\u03b2 as angiogenic factors in mouse \nosteosarcoma (31). While grifolin or celecoxib, a cyclooxy-\ngease-2 inhibitor, induces apoptosis via inhibition of PI3K/AKT \nsignaling pathway in human osteosarcoma cells (32,33), \noverexpression of BMI-1 promotes cell growth and resistance \nto cisplatin treatment via activation of PI3K/AKT pathway in \nosteosarcoma (34). However, our study indicated a marked \ndecrease of PI3Kp85\u03b1 and p-AKT expression in adBMP-9 \ngroup compared with the ad-GFP group and CON group in \nMG-63 and HOS cell lines, suggesting that overexpression of \nBMP-9 inhibited osteosarcoma cell growth and migration via \nblockade of the PI3K/AKT signaling.\n\nKi-67 is a nuclear protein that is expressed in proliferating \ncells and may be required for maintaining cell proliferation, \nused as a marker for cell proliferation of osteosarcoma (35). \nMMP-9 is thought to be key enzymes involved in the degrada-\ntion of type IV collagen and high level of MMP-9 in tissues \nis interralated with tumor growth and invasion (36,37). It is \nreported that PI3K/AKT pathway promotes the growth and \nmetastasis of malignant tumors via upregulation of Ki-67 and \nMMP-9 (38). Our results showed a marked decrease of Ki-67 \nand MMP-9 expression in adBMP-9 group compared with the \nad-GFP group and CON group in MG-63 and HOS cell lines, \nsuggesting that BMP-9 might downregulate the expression of \nKi-67 and MMP-9 via blockade of the PI3K/AKT signaling \npathway in osteosarcoma cells.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report investigating the \nrole of BMP-9 in the growth and migration of osteosarcoma \ncells. Our investigation revealed that the enhanced expression \nof BMP-9 in osteosarcoma cells by adBMP-9 exerted inhibi-\ntory effects on growth and migration of osteosarcoma cells \npossibly via blockade of the PI3K/AKT signaling. BMP-9 as \na tumor suppressor may provide a novel approach to human \nosteosarcoma treatment.\n\nReferences\n\n  1.
