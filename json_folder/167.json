Kreydiy\nThe activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase was shown to be reduced during apoptosis and enhanced during cell\nproliferation. This work investigated whether TNF-a exerts also opposite effects on the Na+/K+ ATPase\nin HepG2 cells and whether these effects are time-dependent. A time response study demonstrated that\nthe activity and protein expression of the ATPase are decreased at 1 h and increased at 4, 6 and 8 h. This\nwork focused on the up-regulatory 4 h-response. TNF-a was shown to exert a stimulatory effect on cJNK\nand NF-jB and an inhibitory effect on caspases which, in the basal state, down-regulate the ATPase. The\ncytokine was found to target the caspases by activating JNK which in turn activates NF-jB. The activated\ntranscription factor inhibits the caspases and frees the ATPase from their inhibitory action leading thus to\nits up-regulation.\n\n\ufffd 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nTumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine\nwith numerous biological properties ranging from inflammation to\nproliferation, differentiation, and cancer growth. It plays a central\nrole in shock due to sepsis and wasting syndromes due to a variety\nof cancers [1]. It is also involved in different physiological and\npathophysiological conditions [2]. In the liver it was described to\nact as a \u2018\u2018two-edged sword\u201d [3], exerting both apoptotic and anti-\napoptotic effects.\n\nThese antagonistic effects were ascribed to the multiple and\ncomplex signaling pathways activated by the cytokine. Caspases,\nnuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [4],\nproteases, ceramides, and reactive oxygen species, were all found\nto mediate TNF-a action. While activation of NF-jB was found cru-\ncial for cell survival, activation of caspases was deemed essential\nfor the apoptotic process. The role of JNK is however still contro-\nversial promoting both apoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses [5].\n\nApoptosis was found to be accompanied by changes in the lev-\nels of Na+, K+ , and Cl\ufffd , and a decrease in the activity of the Na+/K+\n\nATPase also known as Na+/K+ pump [6], a ubiquitous transporter\nresponsible for the establishment of the trans-membrane Na+\n\nand K+ gradients. In a previous work we studied the 1 h effect of\nTNF-a on the Na+-/K+ ATPase in HepG2 cells. The activity of the\nATPase was found to be modulated by JNK, which stimulated the\nll rights reserved.\n\nyeh).\ncaspases and inhibited NF-jB, resulting in a net inhibition of the\npump, and probably favoring the apoptotic pathway [7]. Since\nTNF was reported also to promote cell proliferation in hepatocytes\n[8], we speculated that these antagonistic responses may be due to\ndifferences in the period of action of the cytokine. TNF-a may be\nactivating different mediators at different time intervals leading\nto opposite effects.\n\nThis work aimed at testing this hypothesis and determining the\nmechanism of action of the cytokine.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nMedia and other chemicals needed for cell culture were pur-\nchased from Gibco, Paisley, Scotland.\n\nThe general caspase inhibitor (FK009) and the JNK inhibitor (SP\n600125) were purchased, respectively, from MP Biomedicals, Ohio,\nUSA, and Biosource, CA, USA.\n\nRecombinant Human TNF alpha was purchased from Endogen,\nMA, USA. The primary Na+/K+ ATPase a1 antibody was obtained\nfrom Upstate Va., USA, and the HepG2 cell line from ATCC.\n\nAnti-IjBa monoclonal antibody was obtained from Biosource\nInternational, USA. Goat anti-mouse IgG HPR conjugated antibody\nand Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) kit were obtained from\nSanta Cruz, CA, USA.\n\nJNK activity was measured using a KinasesSTAR\u2122 JNK Activity\nAssay Kit purchased from BioVision CA, USA.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2009.11.020\nmailto:Sawkreyd@aub.edu.lb\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\nFig. 1a.

Kassardjian et al. / Cytokine 49 (2010) 312\u2013318 313\nAll other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St.\nLouis, Missouri, USA.\n\n2.2. Methods\n\n2.2.1. Culture and treatment of HepG2 Cells\nHepG2 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,\n\n1% Penicillin and streptomycin, in a humidified incubator (5% CO2)\nat 37 \ufffdC. When 70\u201380% confluence was reached, the cells were\nstarved overnight and treated next day.\n\nDose and time response studies were conducted by treating the\ncells with different doses of TNF-a (5, 10, 40, and 100 ng/ml) for\n4 h, and with 100 ng/ml of TNF-a for different time periods (1, 2,\n3, 4, 6, and 8 h). The involvement of caspases, JNK and NF-jB\nwas studied by pre-treating the cells with their respective specific\ninhibitors FK009 (4 lM) ([9], SP 600125 (50 lM) [10] and PDTC\n(100 lM) [11] . FK009 was added 15 min before TNF-a, while PDTC\nand SP 600125 were added 30 min before the cytokine.\n\nAt the end of the incubation period, HepG2 cells were washed,\nlysed, homogenized with a polytron at 4 \ufffdC and 20,000 rpm, and\npreserved at \ufffd20 \ufffdC for later use after addition of protease inhibi-\ntors. Proteins were quantified using the Biorad assay.\n\n2.2.2. Western blot analysis\nEqual amounts of protein were loaded and resolved on 8% poly-\n\nacrylamide gels, and were transferred to PVD F membranes. The\nmembranes were then blocked and incubated with a primary\nNa+/K+ ATPase a1 antibody, followed by a secondary IgG conju-\ngated to horseradish peroxidase. Detection of the signal was by en-\nhanced chemiluminescence. Equal loading was checked by\nPonceau staining, a rapid and reversible staining method for visu-\nalizing protein bands on Western blots.\n\n2.2.3. NF-jB activity\nActivation of NF-jB by TNF was investigated by examining the\n\ndegradation of its inhibitory subunit IjBa. The expression of IjB\nwas studied by western blot analysis as described above using 10%\npolyacrylamide gels and an anti-IjBa monoclonal antibody with a\ngoat anti-mouse secondary IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.\n\n2.2.4. Na+/K+ ATPase activity assay\nHomogenates of HepG2 cells were suspended in Tris buffer\n\n(1300 mM NaCl, 200 mM KCl, 40 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM histidine;\npH 7.4) to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Saponin (1%) was then\nadded at a ratio of 1:4 and the samples were incubated at room\ntemperature for 30 min. Aliquots (50 ll) were then drawn and\nincubated at 37 \ufffdC for 30 min, in presence or absence of ouabain\n(3.75 mM final concentration), a specific inhibitor of the ATPase.\nAdenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) (7.5 mM final concentration) was\nthen added and the samples were incubated for an additional\n30 min at 37 \ufffdC. At the end of the incubation period, an equal vol-\nume of trichloroacetic acid (11.5%) was added to stop the reaction,\nand the samples were spun at 3000g for 5 min. The amount of\ninorganic phosphate liberated was measured colorimetrically\naccording to the method of Taussky and Shorr [12]. The enzymatic\nactivity was determined by measuring the ouabain inhibitable\ninorganic phosphate (Pi) released. The percent inhibition of the\nenzyme activity was calculated as follows:\n\n1\ufffd\nPi\u00f0treatment\u00de \ufffd Pi\u00f0treatment \u00fe ouabain\u00de\n\nPi\u00f0control\u00de \ufffd Pi\u00f0control\u00fe ouabain\u00de\n\ufffd 100\nFig. 1b.

The results are representative of an experiment\nrepeated three times.\n2.2.5. c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity\nA \u2018\u2018KinasesStar JNK activity assay kit\u201d was used to measure JNK\n\nactivity according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly JNK\nwas immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and its activity deter-\nmined using recombinant c_jun as a substrate. Phosphorylation\nof c-Jun was detected by western blot analysis.\n2.2.6. Statistical analysis\nResults are reported as means \u00b1 SE and are tested for statistical\n\nsignificance by a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed\nby Tukey\u2013Kramer multiple comparisons test using Instat and Excel\nAnalysis softwares. The results were considered significant at\nP < 0.01.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Time and dose response studies on the effect of TNF-a on the Na+/\nK+ ATPase in HepG2 cells\n\nTNF-a at 100 ng/ml reduced the activity and protein expression\nof the Na+/K+ ATPase at 1 h, and enhanced them at 4, 6 and 8 h\n(Fig. 1a). The most prominent increase was observed at 4 h and\nwas maintained till 8 h (P < 0.001). This is why all further studies\nwere conducted at 4 h. The effect on pump\u2019s expression followed\nthe same pattern as the effect on the pump\u2019s activity (Fig. 1b).\n\nA dose response study was then conducted to see if the effect of\nthe cytokine on the pump is concentration-dependent. The activity\nof the Na+/K+ATPase was significantly increased in starved cells\ntreated for 4 h with 40 and 100 ng/ml TNF-a and unchanged at\nlower doses (5 and 10 ng/ml) (Fig. 1c).\n\nSince the up-regulatory effect observed at 4 h opposed what\nwas found previously at 1 h, we decided to investigate the 4-h re-\nsponse and the signaling pathways involved.\n\n\n\nFig. 1c.

Mediators of the late (4 h) effect of TNF-a on the Na+/K+ ATPase in\nHepG2 cells\n\n3.3.1. Involvement of JNK and NF-KB\nAt 4 h, TNF decreased the expression of IKBa (Fig. 2a) and in-\n\ncreased significantly the phosphorylation of c-jun (Fig. 2b) reveal-\ning an activation of NF-jB and JNK by the cytokine.\n\nThe involvement of NF-jB and Jun Kinase in the late (4 h) re-\nsponse was studied by using their respective inhibitors PDTC and\nSP600125.\n\nPDTC alone had no effect on the expression and activity of the\npump but abrogated completely the effect of TNF-a (Fig. 3a and\nb). The ATPase was down-regulated by SP600125 and in its pres-\nence the up-regulatory effect of TNF was significantly reduced\n(Fig. 3a and b).\n\n3.3.2. Involvement of caspases\nTo determine whether TNF-a signaling is mediated through\n\ncaspases, HepG2 cells were treated with FK009 a general caspase\ninhibitor. The inhibitor FK009 alone, increased both the activity\nand protein expression of the pump, exerting thus a similar effect\nto the one observed with TNF-a (Fig. 4a and b). The up-regulatory\neffect of TNF still appeared in presence of FK009 i.e. when caspases\nwere inhibited.\nFig. 2a. Effect of TNF-a (100 ng/ml, 4 h) on the expression of IjBa.\n\nFig. 2b.

Effect of different combinations of inhibitors on the protein\nexpression and activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase at 4 h\n\nWhen both jun Kinase and NF-jB were inhibited concurrently\nwith their respective inhibitors SP600125 and PDTC, a decrease\nin the activity and protein expression of the Na+/K+ ATPase was ob-\nserved (Fig. 3a and b).

However in their presence\nthe effect of TNF was abrogated completely (Fig. 7a and b).\n\nTable 1 summarizes the effect of the different mediators on the\npump.\n\n\n\nFig. 7b.

Kassardjian et al. / Cytokine 49 (2010) 312\u2013318\n4. Discussion\n\nTNF-a is known to activate different mediators and signaling\npathways that culminate in either cell survival or cell death. Acti-\nvation of the caspase cascade leads to apoptosis [13], while activa-\ntion of NF-jB, induces genes having anti-apoptotic effects. Many\nworks demonstrated that apoptosis is accompanied by a reduction\nin the activity of Na+/K+ ATPase in various experimental models\nwhile stimulation of the ATPase was found to accompany liver\nregeneration [14]. Although many isoforms of the enzyme are\nknown to exist, the a1 isoform is the one present in hepatocytes\n[15].\n\n4.1. Time and dose response studies\n\nTNF acted on the Na+/K+ ATPase time-dependently (Fig. 1a).\nChanges in the ATPase activity and protein expression followed a\nsimilar trend (Fig. 1a and b), suggesting that changes in activity\nare due to changes in the number of ATPase molecules. To deter-\nmine whether these opposite responses are also dose-dependent,\ncells were treated with different concentrations of TNF-a for\n4hrs. At 4 h, TNF-a at doses equal or higher than 40 ng/ml exerted\na stimulatory effect on the ATPase (Fig. 1c). Since an increase in\npump\u2019s activity was reported to occur during liver regeneration\n[16], it can be speculated that TNF promotes at 4 h cell survival.\n\nThe mechanism underlying the early inhibitory response was\nstudied in a previous work [8]. This work is an attempt to unravel\nthe signaling mechanism behind the 4 h-response.\nTable 1\nA summary of the effect of different inhibitors on the Na+/K+ ATPase.\n\nTNF-a PDTC SP00125 FK009\n\n+\n+\n\n+ +\n+\n\n+ +\n+\n\n+ +\n+ +\n\n+ + +\n+ +\n\n+ + +\n+ +\n\n+ + +\n+ + +\n\n+ + + +\n4.2. Signaling mediators\n\n4.2.1. TNF stimulates NF-jB\nInhibition of NF-jB with PDTC abrogated completely the effect\n\nof TNF-a. The results imply that the effect of TNF-a on NF-jB is\nstimulatory because had it been inhibitory, then PDTC would have\nimitated the effect of TNF-a and an up-regulatory effect would\nhave been observed.\n\n4.2.2. TNF stimulates JNK\nTreating the cells with SP600125 (a specific inhibitor of JNK)\n\nabrogated only partially the effect of TNF-a (Fig. 3a and b) suggest-\ning the presence of additional mediators that contribute to the ef-\nfect of TNF on the pump. JNK should be stimulated by the cytokine\nas was the case with NF-jB and for the same reasons mentioned\nabove for NF-jB.\n\n4.2.3. TNF inhibits caspases\nThe up-regulatory response to TNF-a still appeared in presence\n\nof FK009 (Fig. 4a and b), indicating that either caspases are not in-\nvolved in TNF action, or if they are, they are inhibited by the cyto-\nkine. In the latter case, caspase inhibition should imitate the effect\nof TNF-a and this is in fact what was observed when FK009 was\nadded alone (Fig. 4a and b). Addition of TNF-a simultaneously with\nFK009, lead to a similar response to the one observed with each\none separately, inferring that caspases are part of the signaling\npathway activated by TNF or else an additive effect would have\nbeen observed.\n\nIt can be concluded that TNF-a acts via stimulation of NF-jB\nand JNK, and inhibition of caspases. No additional mediators are in-\nvolved in TNF signaling, since when cells were treated with the\ncytokine in presence of inhibitors of all three mediators the effect\nof TNF-a disappeared completely (Fig. 7a and b).\n\n4.3. Positions of the signaling mediators in the pathway\n\n4.3.1.

Kassardjian et al. / Cytokine 49 (2010) 312\u2013318 317\nJNK activate two different pathways that stimulate the pump. It\ncan be postulated that the basal activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase is a\nbalance between two stimulatory pathways mediated via JNK\nand NF-jB, and an inhibitory pathway mediated via caspases.\nWhen caspases are inhibited, the stimulatory effect of JNK and\nNF-jB becomes apparent. When caspases and NF-jB are inhibited\nconcurrently, the up-regulatory effect is reduced because it be-\ncomes restricted only to the one caused by JNK. However when\nJNK and caspases are inhibited concurrently, leaving only NF-jB\nactive, no change is observed in the ATPase activity and expression.\nAs the up-regulatory effect of NF-jB was not observed in this case,\nit can be postulated that it is activated by either JNK or caspases.\nSince the effect of FK009 disappeared partially in presence of PDTC\nbut fully in presence of SP600125 and SP600125 + PDTC, it can\nsafely be concluded that JNK is upstream of NF-jB and causes its\nactivation.\n\nWhen JNK and NF-jB were inhibited simultaneously (Fig. 3a\nand b), leaving only the caspases active, down-regulation of the\npump was observed. This confirms the inhibitory effect of caspases\non the ATPase, an effect that was not counterbalanced anymore, in\nthis case, by the stimulatory effect of JNK and NF-jB.\n\n4.3.2. JNK is upstream of caspases\nThe effect of TNF was abrogated partially in presence of\n\nSP600125 alone but reappeared in the simultaneous presence of\nFK009 and SP600125. It can be speculated that TNF-a inhibits\nthe caspases via activation of JNK, freeing thus the ATPase from\ntheir down-regulatory effect. The data indicate also that JNK is up-\nstream of caspases.\n\n4.3.3. NF-jB is upstream of caspases\nInhibition of NF-jB with PDTC abrogated the effect of TNF and\n\nalthough JNK is still active, no up-regulation was observed because\nit was counteracted by an inhibition caused by active caspases.\nHowever, TNF effect reappeared upon simultaneous inhibition of\nNF-jB and caspases, implying that when NF-jB is active, it inhibits\ncaspases and is upstream of them.\n\nWhen JNK and NF-jB are inhibited concurrently, the ATPase is\ndown-regulated by TNF-a because the caspases remain active and\nare not inhibited by NF-jB.\n\nThe cytokine could not exert its effect in presence of inhibitors\nof all three mediators since all stimulatory and inhibitory path-\nways are blocked. The results infer that no additional mediators\nare involved in the response to TNF-a.\n\n4.4. Signaling pathway of TNF-a\n\nIt can be concluded that TNF-a acts via stimulation of JNK and\nNF-jB, and inhibition of caspases. NF-jB is upstream of the casp-\nases and inhibits them while JNK is upstream of NF-jB and acti-\nvates it and is itself activated by TNF-a. TNF activates also NF-jB\nbut this activity is considerably enhanced by JNK. Fig. 8 represents\nthe postulated signaling pathway underlying the effect of TNF-a on\nthe Na+/K+ATPase at 4 h.\n\n4.5. Possible implications of the up-regulatory effect of TNF-a on the\nNa+/K+ATPase: roles of the mediators\n\nUp-regulation of the pump by TNF-a is suggestive of an anti-\napoptotic state. In fact, in liver regeneration, the activity of the\nNa+/K+ATPase was found to be increased [17,7] and NF-jB acti-\nvated [7].\n\nThe anti-apoptotic effect of NF-jB in hepatocytes has been very\nwell documented and its cytoprotective function has been reported\nby many studies in various cell types [18\u201323]. Mice deficient in NF-\njB activation have been shown to be more susceptible to hepato-\ncarcinogenesis [24]. By activating NF-jB, the cytokine induces a\nnumber of anti-apoptotic genes, including c-FLIP, cIAP1, cIAP2, A1,\nA20, TRAF1, and TRAF2 [5].\n\nOn the other hand caspases have been well recognized as key\nmediators of apoptosis and cell death [25,26]. Since an anti-apop-\ntotic state prevails at 4hrs, the observed inhibition of caspases is\nexpected.\n\nThe role of JNK is however till now highly controversial. Many\nworks correlated activation of JNK with cell death. The kinase\nwas shown to play a central role in mediating the TNF-induced\napoptotis in hepatocytes [27,28] and developing embryonic fore-\nbrain [29,30]. Other studies however, did not find any association\nbetween JNK and cell death [31].\n\nIn this work JNK activation seems to have an anti-apoptotic role,\npromoting cell survival and proliferation. These findings are in line\nwith those reporting a role of JNK in oncogenesis [32\u201334].\n\nThe TNF-induced activation of JNK observed in this work is\nneeded to activate in turn NF-jB. One possible mechanism by\nwhich the kinase could activate the transcription factor would\nbe by phosphorylating directly or indirectly IjB kinase (IKK)\nleading to its activation. IKK would in turn phosphorylate the\ninhibitory protein IjB on serine residues [34] targeting it for ubiq-\nuitination and subsequent degradation, and leading consequently\nto NF-jB activation [18]. Active NF-jB then inhibits caspases.\nSuch an effect has been demonstrated before in fibroblasts by Tang\net al. [35].\n\nIt can be concluded that TNF-a exerts a time-dependent dual\nand opposite effect on the pump. The early 1 h response is inhibi-\ntory and suggestive of an apoptotic state while the later response\nat 4 h is stimulatory and suggestive of cell survival conditions.\nAlthough in both responses JNK is activated and is the key player,\nyet it exerts opposite effects on its targets namely NF-jB and\ncaspases which mediate, respectively, cell survival and apoptosis.\nCaspases are active at 1 h but become inhibited at 4 h. The intrigu-\ning question that needs to be addressed is why is there a transient\nand early activation of caspases that is followed by inhibition? Is\nthis a step in preparation for the anti-apoptotic state that will ap-\npear at 4 h? Su et al. [36] demonstrated previously that a defi-\nciency in caspase 8 abolished the activation of NF-jB induced by\nantigen receptors, Fc receptors, or Toll-like receptor 4 in T, B, and\nnatural killer cells, ascribing thus a role for caspases in the activa-\ntion of the transcription factor. It would be plausible then to as-\nsume that here again, the early and transient activation of\ncaspases aims at triggering the activation of NF-jB which in turn\nwould shut them down.\n\n\n\n318 A.
