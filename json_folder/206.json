To elucidate the functions of CARM1 in tumorigen-\nesis, we knocked out CARM1 from several breast cancer cell lines using Zinc-Finger Nuclease technology,\nwhich resulted in drastic phenotypic and biochemical changes. The CARM1 KO cell lines enabled identifica-\ntion of CARM1 substrates, notably the SWI/SNF core subunit BAF155. Methylation of BAF155 at R1064 was\nfound to be an independent prognostic biomarker for cancer recurrence and to regulate breast cancer cell\nmigration and metastasis. Furthermore, CARM1-mediated BAF155 methylation affects gene expression by\ndirecting methylated BAF155 to unique chromatin regions (e.g., c-Myc pathway genes). Collectively, our\nstudies uncover a mechanism by which BAF155 acquires tumorigenic functions via arginine methylation.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCoactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1),\n\nalso known as PRMT4, is a type I protein argininemethyltransfer-\n\nase (PRMT) that asymmetrically dimethylates protein substrates\n\non arginine residues. CARM1 was originally identified as a coac-\n\ntivator for steroid hormone receptors (Chen et al., 1999). CARM1\n\nknockout (KO) mice die at birth (Yadav et al., 2003), showing\n\nthat CARM1 is specifically required for postnatal survival. Inter-\n\nestingly, methyltranserase-inactivated CARM1 knockin mice\n\nphenocopy CARM1 null mice, indicating that CARM1 requires\nSignificance\n\nAlthough mutations or epigenetic changes inactivating and al\nSNF are frequently linked to cancer, the mechanisms underlyin\nand pathways that induce SWI/SNF\u2019s oncogenic effects would\ndriving changes while retaining SWI/SNF\u2019s normal functions. H\nstrate for arginine methyltransferase CARM1. Methylation of B\ndrive regulation of genes in the c-Myc and certainmetastatic pa\nremodeling factor is activated by arginine methylation to regu\nits enzymatic activity for the majority, if not all, of its in vivo func-\n\ntions (Kim et al., 2010).\n\nEmerging evidence implies oncogenic functions of CARM1 in\n\nhuman cancer. CARM1 transactivates many cancer-associated\n\ntranscription factors including NF-kB, p53, E2F1, and steroid\n\nreceptors such as estrogen receptor alpha (ERa; Bedford and\n\nClarke, 2009), and promotes cancer cell proliferation (El Mes-\n\nsaoudi et al., 2006; Frietze et al., 2008). Recent tissue microarray\n\nstudies revealed that CARM1 expression is higher in metastatic\n\nbreast tumors than in normal breast tissues (Mann et al., 2013),\n\nparticularly in triple negative tumors lacking expression of ERa,\ntering the functions of chromatin remodeling complex SWI/\ng these connections remain unclear. Delineating the factors\nenable preventive and therapeutic targeting of these cancer-\nere, we identify BAF155, a SWI/SNF core subunit, as a sub-\nAF155 is required for its association with genomic sites that\nthways. This represents amechanismbywhich a chromatin-\nlate genes that enhance tumor progression and metastasis.\n\nCancer Cell 25, 21\u201336, January 13, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc. 21\n\nmailto:wxu@oncology.wisc.edu\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2013.12.007\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2013.12.007&domain=pdf\n\n\nFigure 1.

These results imply that\n\naltered CARM1expression may underlie pathological conditions\n\nand that, in breast cancer, CARM1 has roles beyond serving as a\n\ncoactivator for ERa. It remains to be determined whether the\n\noncogenic functions of CARM1 depend on its ability to regulate\n\ncancer-driving transcription factors or to directly methylate can-\n\ncer-relevant substrates, or both.\n\nThe significance of identifying cancer-relevant CARM1 sub-\n\nstrates is underscored by studies of the roles of histone H3\n\nmethylation in transcriptional activation of ER target genes (Wu\n\nand Xu, 2012). Nonhistone substrates include p300/CBP,\n\nAIB1/SRC-3, and RNA binding proteins such as PABP1, HuR,\n\nHuD, and HnRNPs (Bedford and Clarke, 2009). Multiple lines of\n\nevidence indicate that normal CARM1 expression is well above\n\nthat required for its essential roles. For instance, normal develop-\n\nmental functions were maintained in genetically engineered\n\nCARM1 hypomorphic mice with only 25% of the wild-type\n\n(WT) CARM1 level (Kim et al., 2010). We recently showed that\n\nknocking down 90% of endogenous CARM1 in MCF7 cells\n\nonly slightly reduces methylation of PABP1 (Zeng et al., 2013).\n\nThese results imply that even greatly depleted CARM1 catalytic\n\nactivity and substrate methylation are sufficient to maintain\n\nmajor biological functions. Previously, CARM1 null mouse em-\n\nbryonic fibroblast cell lysates were used as a hypomethylated\n\nsubstrate source that led to identifying PABP1 as a CARM1 sub-\n\nstrate (Lee and Bedford, 2002). The CARM1 null cancer cell lines\n\nwould greatly facilitate identifying cancer-relevant substrates\n\nand understanding of CARM1 oncogenic functions in breast\n\ncancer cells. Herein, we generated CARM1 KO cancer cell lines\n\nand used them to explore the roles of BAF155 methylation by\n\nCARM1 in breast cancer models.\n\nRESULTS\n\nGeneration of CARM1 KO Breast Cancer Cell Lines\nUsing ZFN Technology\nWe recently developed a sensitive methylated PABP1 (me-\n\nPABP1) western blot method to monitor endogenous CARM1\n\nlevels and activity (Zeng et al., 2013). In contrast to the complete\n\nloss of me-PABP1 in CARM1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts\n\n(CARM1\ufffd/\ufffd MEFs; Figure 1A, lanes 1 and 2), we found that\neven though small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown\n\ndecreased CARM1 levels by 90%, the cellular me-PABP1 level\n\ndecreased by less than 20% (Figure 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Thus,\n\nlow levels of CARM1 are capable of substantial PABP1 methyl-\n\nation. Because CARM1 substrates therefore should remain\n\nsignificantly methylated in CARM1 knockdown cells but be hy-\n\npomethylated in CARM1 null cells, we generated CARM1 null\n\ncancer cell lines to identify cancer-relevant CARM1 substrates.\n\nWe utilized Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) technology to create a\n\nhighly specific genomic scissors targeting exon 8 of CARM1\n\n(Figure 1B), and through this generated a complete KO in cancer\n\ncell lines. After transient transfection of ZFN plasmids into cells,\n\nwe performed limiting dilution to select single clones and\n(F) Western blot of CARM1, PABP1, and me-PABP1 in MCF7, two MCF7 CA\n\nretroviral infection.\n\n(G) Representative cell morphology images of MCF7 cells, MCF7-shCARM1 cell\n\nSee also Figure S1.\nconfirmed CARM1 KO by loss of me-PABP1 (Figure 1C) and\n\ngenomic DNA sequencing (Figure 1D). Representative KO\n\nclones with complete depletion of me-PABP1 are shown in Fig-\n\nure 1C for MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and human embryonic kidney\n\n293T (HEK293T) cell lines. The human CARM1 gene locus\n\nresides at chromosome19 p13.2, a region triplicated in MCF7\n\nand duplicated in MDA-MB-231 cells. The genomic DNA\n\nsequencing analysis of two representative CARM1 KO clones\n\nof MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 1D) revealed misrepaired\n\nDNA, resulting in mRNA degradation and gene deletion.\n\nAlthough the efficiency of ZFN KO varied among cell lines\n\nat 1.3%, 0.5%, and 3.6% for MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and\n\nHEK293T, respectively, the average KO efficiency across all\n\nclones analyzed was 1.2% (Figure 1E). When CARM1was re-ex-\n\npressed in two individual MCF7 CARM1 KO clones, me-PABP1\n\nwas restored (Figure 1F). Interestingly, we found that KO of\n\nCARM1 in MCF7 cells inducedmorphology changes (Figure 1G),\n\nwhereas nomorphology changewas observed inMCF7 cells ex-\n\npressing CARM1 shRNA to knock down CARM1 to 10% of WT\n\nlevels (Figure 1G). The morphology change in the two KO clones\n\nwas rescued by re-expressingWTCARM1 (Figure 1G) but not an\n\nenzyme-defective mutant (data not shown). We compared the\n\nin vitro cell growth and in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-231\n\nCARM1 KO and MCF7 CARM1 KO with their parental cells. KO\n\nof CARM1 impeded cell growth and colony formation (Figures\n\nS1A and S1B available online) and tumor growth in vivo (Fig-\n\nure S1C). These data strongly suggest that the cell morphology\n\nchange and growth defect in KO cells could be due to loss of\n\nmethylation of CARM1 substrates.\n\nIdentification of BAF155 as a Substrate for CARM1\nThe lack of understanding of the biological functions of CARM1\n\nin cancers is at least partially attributed to the limited number of\n\nknown CARM1 substrates. A few CARM1 substrates were previ-\n\nously identified or validated by comparing CARM1+/+ and\n\nCARM1\ufffd/\ufffd MEF cell lysates for in vitro and in vivo methylation\n(Cheng et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2004). In contrast to CARM1-\n\nexpressing cells, where potential CARM1 substrates would be\n\nblocked for further methylation, CARM1\ufffd/\ufffd MEF lysates served\nas a hypomethylated substrate resource for CARM1 substrate\n\nidentification. Indeed, we found that MCF7 CARM1 KO cell\n\nlysates were more strongly methylated in vitro by recombinant\n\nCARM1 protein than CARM1\ufffd/\ufffd MEF cell lysates, as assayed\nby 3H-CH3 labeling in an autoradiograph (Figure S2A) and west-\n\nern blotting using a newly developed asymmetrically dimethy-\n\nlated arginine (a-ADMA) antibody (Dhar et al., 2013; Figure S2B).\n\nThis result implies that MCF7 CARM1 KO cells serve as a good\n\nresource for substrate discovery.\n\nWhen cell lysates derived from parental MCF7 cells and\n\nCARM1 KO cells were probed with monomethylated arginine\n\n(a-MMA) and a-ADMA antibodies in western blots, asymmetri-\n\ncally dimethylated proteins, in particular those in the high mo-\n\nlecular weight range, were significantly affected by CARM1\n\nKO (Figure 2A). This is in contrast to the lack of a significant\nRM1 KO clones, and MCF7 CARM1 KO clones re-expressing CARM1 by\n\ns, and the MCF7-derived CARM1 KO cell lines listed in (F). Scale bar = 40 mm.\n\nCancer Cell 25, 21\u201336, January 13, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc. 23\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

In order to identify CARM1\n\nsubstrates in breast cancer cells, we used the a-ADMA anti-\n\nbody to immunoprecipitate proteins from cell lysates derived\n24 Cancer Cell 25, 21\u201336, January 13, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc.\nfrom parental MCF7 cells expressing WT CARM1 and MCF7\n\nCARM1 KO cells, respectively. The discrete bands in WT cells\n\nstained with Coomassie blue were excised and subjected to\n\n\n\nCancer Cell\n\nCARM1 Methylates BAF155 to Promote Tumorigenesis\nmass spectrometry, from which ten candidate proteins were\n\nidentified (Figure 2B). To discern whether these proteins are\n\nCARM1 substrates, we immunoprecipitated endogenous pro-\n\nteins (BRG1, BAF170, BAF155, and BAF250) or FLAG-tagged\n\nproteins (TRAP150, Caprin 1, TRAP230, and BCLAF1) tran-\n\nsiently transfected to MCF7 WT or KO cells, and followed\n\ntheir fate in western blots using a-ADMA or a-FLAG antibody,\n\nrespectively.\n\nWestern blot results using a-ADMA antibody (Figure 2C)\n\nclassified the candidate proteins into three categories. The first\n\ncategory includes BAF155 and TRAP230 proteins, which are\n\ndimethylated in WT but not in KO MCF7 cells, indicating that\n\narginine dimethylation of these proteins is CARM1 dependent.\n\nThe second category includes Caprin1 and BCLAF1 proteins,\n\nwhich are dimethylated in WT and KO cells at similar levels,\n\nindicating that CARM1 is not their sole methyltransferase.\n\nFinally, the third category includes BAF170, BRG1, BAF250,\n\nand TRAP150 proteins, which are not recognized by a-ADMA\n\nantibody, suggesting that they were immunoprecipitated by\n\nthe a-ADMA antibody via indirect association with bone fide\n\nCARM1 substrates (e.g., BRG1, BAF250, and BAF170 are in\n\ncomplex with methylated BAF155). Although the a-ADMA anti-\n\nbody recently developed by Cell Signaling appeared sensitive\n\nin detecting CARM1 substrates, this antibody has not been\n\nextensively characterized (Dhar et al., 2013).\n\nSince a previous study had reported that a histone H3 argi-\n\nnine17 dimethylation (H3R17me2) antibody, while recognizing\n\nthe H3R17me2 mark, also recognized other CARM1 substrates\n\nin MEF cells (Cheng et al., 2007), we employed this anti-\n\nH3R17me2 antibody for western blotting (Figure S2C, left panel)\n\nand immunoprecipitation, followed by Coomassie blue staining\n\n(Figure S2C, right panel), using total cell lysates from MCF7\n\nWT and KO cells. Similar to the pattern detected by a-ADMA\n\nantibody, the recognized proteins specific to CARM1 WT but\n\nnot CARM1 KO cells reside in the high molecular weight range,\n\namong which BAF155 was identified using mass spectrometry\n\n(Figure S2C). Correspondingly, one strong band (Figure S2D,\n\narrow head) migrating between 130 and 250 kDa was detected\n\nby a-ADMA antibody in the a-H3R17me2 immunoprecipitates\n\nfrom WT but not KO MCF7 cell lysates. This band was subse-\n\nquently proved to be BAF155 by reciprocal immunoprecipitation\n\nusing H3R17me2 and BAF155 antibodies (Figures S2E and S2F).\n\nCollectively, BAF155 appeared to be amain substrate of CARM1\n\nin MCF7 cells detected by both a-ADMA and H3R17me2\n\nantibodies.\n\nTo address whether BAF155 ismethylated by CARM1 directly,\n\nwe performed in vitro methylation assays using recombinant\n\nCARM1 and hypomethylated BAF155 purified from HEK293T\n\nCARM1 KO cells in the presence of adenosyl-L-methionine,\n\nS-[methyl-3H] (3H-SAM). As expected, BAF155 was methylated\n\nby CARM1 in vitro (Figure 2D). Finally, we demonstrated that\n\nBAF155 methylation could be restored in HEK293T CARM1\n\nKO cells by expressing WT CARM1 but not a methylation-\n\ndefective mutant (Figure 2E). These results collectively\n\ndemonstrate that CARM1 is both necessary and sufficient to\n\nmethylate BAF155. In keeping with this finding, CARM1 was\n\nfound to be the only PRMT among PRMT family members\n\n(PRMT1\u2013PRMT8) that is capable of methylating BAF155\n\nin vitro (Figure S2G).\nCARM1 Methylates BAF155 at a Single Site, R1064\nAlthough multiple CARM1 substrates were discovered using the\n\na-ADMA antibody and CARM1 KO cell line (Figure 2B), we chose\n\nto focus on BAF155 because BAF155, a core subunit of switch/\n\nsucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling com-\n\nplex, has been reported upregulated in colon, cervical, and pros-\n\ntate cancer (Lapointe et al., 2004; Tomlins et al., 2007; Varambally\n\net al., 2005). Using PMeS (Shi et al., 2012), an online tool for pre-\n\ndicting protein methylation sites based on an enhanced feature-\n\nencoding scheme, five putative arginine methylation sites were\n\npredicted on human BAF155 (Table S1). Based on the putative\n\nmethylation sites, a full-length and four C-terminally truncated\n\nBAF155 derivatives with C-terminal myc tags were constructed\n\n(Figure 3A). These plasmids were transiently transfected into\n\nHEK293T cells, and the resulting proteins were immunopreci-\n\npated using a-myc antibody and western blotted with a-ADMA\n\nantibody (Figure 3B). Notably, full-length BAF155 but none\n\nof the truncated BAF155 proteins was detected by a-ADMA\n\nantibody, suggesting that the BAF155 methylation site follows\n\nresidue 956. We then individually mutated C-proximal R1032\n\nand R1064 to lysine in FLAG-tagged expression plasmids.\n\nAfter transient expression and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation,\n\nFLAG-BAF155R1032K but not FLAG-BAF155R1064K protein was\n\ndetected by a-ADMA antibody in vivo (Figure 3C). Similarly, the\n\nrecombinant BAF155R1064K mutant protein was not methylated\n\nby recombinant CARM1 in vitro (Figure 3D). Thus, R1064 is the\n\nonly BAF155 site methylated by CARM1.\n\nAntibodies against endogenous CARM1 or BAF155 each\n\nimmunoprecipitated both proteins from MCF7 cell lysates\n\n(Figure 3E), suggesting that CARM1 and BAF155 may directly\n\ninteract. To map the BAF155 region mediating association with\n\nCARM1, we linked each of a series of BAF155 truncation deriv-\n\natives (Chen and Archer, 2005) with a T7 promoter and FLAG\n\ntag (Figure 3F) for in vitro transcription/translation assays. As\n\nshown in Figure 3F, full-length BAF155 and its C-terminally trun-\n\ncated (D1, D2, D3 and D4) but not N-terminally truncated (D5, D6\n\nand D7) derivatives bound strongly to bacterially expressed\n\nglutathione S-transferase CARM1 (GST-CARM1). Thus, the\n\nacidic domain at the BAF155 N terminus mediates interaction\n\nwith CARM1, although R1064, the site of methylation, localizes\n\nto the BAF155 C terminus. R1064 of human BAF155, located\n\nin the evolutionarily conserved proline- and glutamine-rich (P/\n\nQ-rich) domain, is conserved among higher eukaryotes (Fig-\n\nure 3G). BAF170, while sharing 61.7% protein sequence identity\n\nwith BAF155, lacks an arginine residue at a position equivalent\n\nto R1064 in its corresponding P/Q-rich domain (Figure 3H).\n\nThis explains why BAF170, a close homolog of BAF155, is not\n\na substrate for CARM1 (Figure 2C).\n\nThe Majority of Endogenous BAF155 in MCF7 Cells Is\nDimethylated\nTo investigate the prevalence of endogenous BAF155 dimethy-\n\nlation in breast cancer cells, we generated a rabbit polyclonal\n\nantibody specific for dimethylated BAF155 (Figure S3A). This\n\nme-BAF155 antibody detects methylation of endogenous\n\nBAF155 in WT MCF7 cells but not in two MCF7 CARM1 KO\n\nclones (Figure S3B). Similar to PABP1 (Figure 1A), me-BAF155\n\nwas still detectable in MCF7-shCARM1 cells (Figure S3C).

Moreover, BAF155 and\n\nme-BAF155 immunofluorescence were confined to the nucleus\n\n(Figure S3E). Since the majority of endogenous BAF155 is dime-\n\nthylated, we went on to study the role of BAF155 methylation in\n\nhuman breast cancer cells.\n\nBAF155 Methylation at R1064 Creates Unique\nChromatin Association Patterns\nBAF155, a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodel-\n\ning complex, was shown to associate with chromatin depen-\n\ndently or independently of other SWI/SNF subunits using\n\nchromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in HeLa\n\ncells (Euskirchen et al., 2011). Accordingly, we decided to deter-\n\nmine the effect of BAF155 methylation on its chromatin associa-\n\ntion. First, to substitute endogenous BAF155 with BAF155R1064K\n\nmutant, we infected MCF7 cells with retrovirus vectors express-\n\ning either WT BAF155 (BAF155WT), mutant BAF155R1064K, or\n\nGFP as a negative control (Figure 4A). After confirming that\n\nthe resulting total BAF155 level was twice the endogenous\n\nBAF155 level, we stably knocked down endogenous BAF155 us-\n\ning a lentiviral-expressing shRNA, which selectively targets the\n\n30UTR of the endogenous, but not the lentiviral-expressed,\nBAF155 mRNA. Figure 4A shows that BAF155 was silenced\n\nin MCF7-GFP cells, and that MCF7-BAF155WT and MCF7-\n\nBAF155R1064K cells express reconstituted BAF155WT and\n\nBAF155R1064K proteins to levels similar to that of endogenous\n\nBAF155 protein in the parental MCF7 cells. Interestingly,\n\nsubstituting endogenous BAF155 with BAF155R1064K, like\n\nBAF155 knockdown, significantly reduced colony size (Fig-\n\nure 4B, lower panels) and yield (Figure 4C), while cell morphology\n\nwas not changed (Figure 4B, upper panels). To investigate\n\nwhether BAF155 methylation by CARM1 is required for\n\nCARM1-induced colony formation in MCF7 cells, we first stably\n\noverexpressed BAF155WT and BAF155R1064 in MCF7 CARM1\n\nKO cells, respectively, followed by knocking down the endo-\n\ngenous BAF155 in these cells using lentivirus-expressing\n\nshBAF155. Subsequently CARM1 was restored in MCF7\nFigure 3.

Restoring CARM1 in\n\nBAF155WT-expressing but not BAF155R1064K-expressing cells\n\nrescued colony formation in terms of both colony size and yield\n\n(Figures 4E and 4F). These results further support that BAF155\n\nmethylation affects the cellular functions of BAF155.\n\nTo ensure that BAF155 methylation does not affect its assem-\n\nbly into the SWI/SNF complex, we expressed BAF155WT and\n\nBAF155R1064K in SKOV3, an ovarian cancer cell line that ex-\n\npresses all SWI/SNF components except BAF155 (DelBove\n\net al., 2011). As shown in Figure S4, immunoprecipitating\n\neither BAF155WT or BAF155R1064K effectively pulled down other\n\nSWI/SNF components such as BRG1, BAF60a, and BAF47\n\nin SKOV3 cells. Only BAF155WT, but not BAF155R1064K, was\n\nmethylated by endogenous CARM1, as revealed by a-ADMA\n\nimmunoblot (Figure S4A). Thus, both CARM1-methylated\n\nand -unmethylated BAF155 assemble into SWI/SNF complexes.\n\nNext we determinedwhethermethylation of BAF155 affects its\n\nchromatin association, using a genomic ChIP-seq approachwith\n\nMCF7-BAF155WT and MCF7-BAF155R1064K cells. A ChIP-grade\n\nBAF155 antibody (Euskirchen et al., 2011) was used for ChIP fol-\n\nlowed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Representative\n\nBAF155WT, BAF155R1064K, and BRG1 binding sites in HeLa\n\nand MCF7 cells in a 7.5 Mb region of chromosome 8 are shown\n\nin Figure 4G. As expected, while some BAF155WT peaks identi-\n\nfied in MCF7 cells overlap with the binding sites of BAF155 and\n\nBRG1 in HeLa cells (Figure 4G, box a; Euskirchen et al., 2011),\n\nBAF155WT also has unique binding sites in MCF7 and HeLa cells\n\n(Figure 4G, box d). We subsequently analyzed the genome-wide\n\ndistribution of BAF155 binding peaks in MCF7 expressing WT or\n\nmutant BAF155. Totals of 2,667 and 1,566 peaks were identified\n\nfor BAF155WT or BAF155R1064K, respectively. Among these, 983\n\npeaks overlapped (Table S2). The numbers of annotated genes\n\nin the genomic regions associated with these BAF155WT and\n\nBAF155R1064K binding sites are shown in Figure 4H. As in HeLa\n\ncells, approximately 60% of BAF155 binding sites in MCF7 cells\n\nreside in gene bodies (exons and introns; Figure 4I). Moreover,\n\nBAF155 peaks in MCF7 cells are enriched within +50 kb from\n\nthe transcription starting sites (TSSs), which are likely to contain\n\nenhancer regions (Figure 4J).

Next we performed conventional ChIP using distinct\n\nsets of biological samples to validate whether BAF155 is associ-\n\nated with the binding sites determined in the ChIP-seq experi-\n\nment. As shown in Figure 5A, BAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K\n\nwas found associated with the ChIP-seq-implicated regions\n\nof CDCA7, COL1A2, GADD45A, DDX18, and NDRG1, whereas\n\nboth BAF155 forms were detected at the promoter region of\n\nCDH1. ChIP using the me-BAF155 antibody confirmed the\n\nassociation of me-BAF155 to COL1A2 and GADD45A genes\n\nin MCF7-BAF155WT but not in MCF7-BAF155R1064K cells (Fig-\n\nure 5B). Importantly, BAF155 association strongly correlated\n\nwith gene expression. COL1A2 and GADD45A mRNA levels,\n\nfor example, were higher in MCF7-BAF155WT than in MCF7-\n\nBAF155R1064 or MCF7-GFP with endogenous BAF155 silenced\n\n(Figure 5C). To examine whether the association of BAF155\n\nwithCOL1A2 andGADD45A genes depends on CARM1 expres-\n\nsion, we performed ChIP assays in parental MCF7 and CARM1\n\nKO cells. As shown in Figures 5D and 5F, CARM1 KO resulted\n\nin significant decreases of BAF155 association with the impli-\n\ncated regions of COL1A2 and GADD45A. Thus, CARM1 is an\n\nimportant determinant for BAF155 genomic association, and\n\nCARM1-mediated BAF155 methylation could induce BAF155\n\nassociation with unique genomic sites to control gene regulation.\n\nInterestingly, we could not detect binding above background\n\nof CARM1, BAF53, or SWI/SNF adenosine triphosphatase\n\n(ATPase) subunits BRG1 and BRM at the same regions of the\n\nCOL1A2 and GADD45A genes where BAF155 binds (Figures\n\n5E and 5G), although BRG1 could be detected at positive control\n(C) Colony yields for the cell lines in (B).\n\n(D) Western blotting analysis of CARM1, BAF155, and me-BAF155 proteins in MC\n\nBAF155R1064K cells engineered to express either GFP or CARM1. b-Actin was us\n\n(E) Representative images of colonies formed by each cell line shown in (D).

Despite\n\nthe lack of detectable binding of BRG1 to COL1A2, GADD45A,\n\nand NDRG1 regions (Figure S5D), SNF5 but not BAF53 was\n\nfound at the BAF155-binding sites (Figures 5E, 5G, and S5D)\n\nof the corresponding genes. Accordingly, methylated BAF155\n\nmight be in a subcomplex with other BAFs such as SNF5 at\n\nunique chromatin sites.\n\nBAF155 Methylation Correlates with Human Breast\nCancer Progression and Malignancy\nTo determine whether me-BAF155 could serve as a prognostic\n\nbiomarker for human breast cancer, we first optimized the\n\nme-BAF155 peptide antibody for immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\nIHC staining of me-BAF155 could be completely blocked by\n\nme-BAF155 peptide but not by nonmethylated BAF155 peptide\n\n(Figure S6A), showing that the me-BAF155 antibody is specific.\n\nWe next performed IHC using total BAF155 antibody as well\n\nas me-BAF155 antibody with four pairs of matched breast\n\nnormal and tumor samples. As shown in Figure S6B, me-\n\nBAF155 staining was almost undetectable in normal samples,\n\nwhile both total BAF155 protein level and me-BAF155 intensity\n\nwere elevated in breast tumors. Notably, CARM1 protein levels\n\nalso were elevated in tumors relative to matched normal tissues\n\n(Figure S6C).\n\nThese results suggest that the increased level of me-\n\nBAF155 in tumors reflects overall elevated levels of BAF155\n\nand CARM1. Thus, the me-BAF155 level might be a sensitive\n\nbreast cancer progression biomarker. To test this hypothesis,\n\nwe employed commercial tissuemicroarrays (TMAs), which con-\n\ntained\ufffd80 samples from normal tissues, tumor-adjacent normal\n(TAN), benign tumors, malignant tumors, and metastatic tumors\n\nexcised prior to treatment. Modest me-BAF155 staining was\n\nseen with normal (Figure 6A), TAN, and benign tissues (Fig-\n\nure 6B). In contrast, significantly greater me-BAF155 IHC\n\nstaining was observed with malignant and metastatic tumors.\n\nOne hundred percent of metastatic tumors (6/6) showed strong\n\npositive staining for me-BAF155 (Figures 6C and 6D). To investi-\n\ngate if BAF155 methylation status is associated with clinical\n\noutcomes, we employed TMAs containing 372 breast tumor\n\nspecimens with 150 months of clinical follow-up.

The Kaplan-Meier\n\nplot shows that the me-BAF155-negative patients have a higher\n\nrecurrence-free survival rate than do me-BAF155-positive\n\npatients (Figure 6E). A log-rank test performed to formally test\n\nthis difference in recurrence-free survival rates yielded a statisti-\n\ncally significant p value of 0.0497. Notably, the results of the\n\nmultivariate analyses performed using the Cox proportional\n\nhazards model indicate a recurrence hazard 1.789 times higher\n\nfor patients with me-BAF155-positive tumors when compared\n\nwith me-BAF155-negative tumors (p = 0.034; Figures 6F and\n\n6G). This hazard ratio of 1.789 for me-BAF155-positive tumors\n\nis similar to that of triple-negative breast cancer (hazard ratio =\n\n1.845), a category well known for its poor prognosis. This differ-\n\nence in recurrence hazard rates is shown in the cumulative\n\nhazard plot (Figure 6F). These data underscored the potential\n\nuse of me-BAF155 as a biomarker of malignant breast cancer\n\nand also in prognostic stratification of breast cancer patients.\n\nMethylation of BAF155 Promotes Migration and\nMetastasis of Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Vivo\nTo investigate of the role of BAF155 methylation in tumor migra-\n\ntion and metastasis, we employed MDA-MB-231, an aggressive\n\nbreast cancer cell line model, for in vitro transwell migration and\n\nin vivo metastasis studies. Using a strategy similar to that for\n\nMCF7 cells (Figure 4A), we engineered stable cell line MDA-\n\nMB-231-GFP with endogenous BAF155 knockdown, and its\n\nreconstituted derivatives MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT and MDA-\n\nMB-231-BAF155R1064K (Figure 7A). Knockdown of endogenous\n\nBAF155 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly decreased cell\n\ngrowth (Figure 7B, compare - with ,), which was rescued by\n\nrestoring BAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K (Figure 7B, compare\n\n: with 6). Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous BAF155\n\nin MDA-MB-231 cells significantly decreased cell migration in\n\ntranswell assay, an effect that was partially rescued by restoring\n\nBAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K (Figure 7C). To explore the\n\npossibility that methylation of BAF155 is required for establishing\n\nmetastatic lung colonization in vivo, we injected MDA-MB-\n\n231-BAF155WT and MDA-MB-231-BAF155R1064K cells stably\n\nexpressing firefly luciferase intravenously to nude mice and\n\nmonitored tumor cell colonization and outgrowth in lung using\n\nbioluminescence imaging.

Student\u2019s t test was used for\nmulated in the lung as expected (Minn et al., 2005). Time-\n\ncourse analysis of the two cohorts revealed significant\n\ndifferences in lung colonization. BAF155WT-expressing but not\n\nBAF155R1064K-expressing cells showed colonization and tumor\n\noutgrowth in lung (Figure 7D). Thus, BAF155 methylation is posi-\n\ntively linked to lung metastasis.\n\nTo gain further insight into the mechanism by which\n\nBAF155 methylation regulates MDA-MB-231 metastasis,\n\nwe employed the tumor metastasis RT2 profiler PCR array\n\n(SABiosciences), containing 84 genes involved in metastasis, to\n\ncompare the mRNA expression profiles between MDA-MB-\n\n231-BAF155R1064K and MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT (Figure 7E). If\n\nmore than 2-fold expression difference was seen between\n\nthe two cell lines, the corresponding genes are marked green\n\nor red (Figure 7E) and are listed in Figure 7F. Two metastasis\n\nrepressor genes, CDH11 and KISS1R, were upregulated,\n\nand six metastasis-promoting genes, CCL7, CDH6, COL4A2,\n\nCXCL12, MMP13, and MYCL1, were downregulated in MDA-\n\nMB-231-BAF155R1064K cells compared with BAF155WT cells.\n\nFour genes were selected for validation using real-time PCR.\n\nIndeed, KISS1R and CDH11 were expressed at higher levels in\n\nMDA-MB-231-BAF155R1064K cells, whereas CCL7 and COL4A2\n\nwere expressed at higher levels in MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT\n\ncells (Figure 7G). We further systematically compared the\n\ndifferential gene expression of MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT\n\nand -BAF155R1064K using Affymetrix microarrays. Over 700\n\ngenes were differentially expressed in two cell lines (p < 0.05);\n\n322 and 411 genes were upregulated and downregulated,\n\nrespectively (Figure S7A). Among other differential expressed\n\ngenes identified (Table S3), the metastasis genes COL4A2\n\nand TIMP3 (Figure 7F) and c-MYC pathway gene CDCA7 (Fig-\n\nure 5C) were expressed at higher levels in BAF155WT cells than\n\ninBAF155R1064K cells. Geneontology pathway analyses revealed\n\nthat themajor differentially expressed genes fall in the categories\n\nof cellular movement, cellular organization, cell proliferation,\n\nand migration (Figure S7B). Moreover, despite the different cell\n\nlines used to study gene expression andDNAbinding differences\n\nbetween WT BAF155 and BAF155R1064K, one-fourth of the\n\ndifferentially expressed genes identified by microarrays in\n\nMDA-MB-231 cells overlap with differentially bound genomic\n\nregions identified by ChIP-seq in MCF7 cells (Figure S7C).

This echoes the in vivo mouse model\n\nwhere reducing CARM1 to 25% of endogenous level still sus-\n\ntains normal development (Kim et al., 2010). Consistent with\n\nthis, CARM1 KO decreased cell and tumor growth in vitro and\n\nin vivo, in contrast to little in vivo growth effect of CARM1\n\nshRNA-mediated knockdown in MCF7 (Al-Dhaheri et al., 2011).\n\nWhile CARM1 knockdown may selectively affect methylation of\n\nsome substrates but not others, our findings underscore the\n\nimportance of using complete KOs when studying the biological\n\nfunctions of enzymes.\n\nAlthough engineered ZFNs have been used for genome editing\n\nin diverse model organisms, allele engineering in somatic cell\n\ngenetics has not been widely applied for determining enzyme\n\nfunctions. KO efficiency by ZFNs varies among cancer cell lines\n\nand depends on transfection efficiency and the multiplicity of the\n\ntargeted chromosome. For example, the CARM1 disruption fre-\n\nquency reached 10% of alleles in diploid breast cancer cell line\n\nCAL51 (data not shown), compared with 1.3% in MCF7 cells\n\nwhere CARM1-bearing chromosome 19 is triplicated. In fact,\n\none-time transient transfection of a plasmid encoding the\n\nCARM1 ZFN in MCF7 cells only disrupted CARM1 biallelically,\n\nas confirmed by sequencing of genomic DNA. In agreement\n\nwith a report that sequential ZFN transfection of biallelically dis-\n\nrupted clones resulted in triple locus KO at frequency of 1% (Liu\n\net al., 2010), limiting dilution and genotyping without antibiotic\n\nselection yielded two MCF7 clones (out of 159) in which\n\nCARM1 was disrupted triallelically (Figure 1E). Despite low KO\n\nfrequency in some cases, ZFN-mediated KO of genes like\n\nCARM1 in cancer cell lines provides unprecedented opportu-\n\nnities for cancer-relevant substrate discovery since, for example,\n\nMEFs lack or express many CARM1 substrates at lower level\n\nthan CARM1 null cancer cell lines. Identifying cancer-relevant\n\nsubstrates for CARM1 is essential for elucidating its functions\n\nin cancer, as exemplified by BAF155.\n\nSWI/SNF is a multisubunit chromatin-remodeling complex\n\nthat has been strongly implicated in cancer development due\n\nto aberrant expression and mutation of its subunits in many\n\ntumor types (Weissman and Knudsen, 2009). Accompanying\n\nthe SWI/SNF ATPase subunits (e.g., BRG1) are 9\u201312 BAF\n\nproteins, including core and accessory subunits. The core\n\nsubunits, BAF155, BAF170, and SNF5 (also referred to as\n\nSMARCB1, BAF47, or SNF5/INI1), were defined on the basis\n\nof their ability to restore efficient nucleosome remodeling\n\nin vitro (Phelan et al., 1999). Recent whole genome sequencing\n\nof human tumors revealed that SWI/SNF subunits are mutated\n\nin >20% of human malignancies (Kadoch et al., 2013). For\nFigure 6.

Conflicting evidence suggests\n\nthat BAF155 may serve as tumor suppressor or oncogene\n\nin a tumor-type-specific manner. BAF155 was initially impli-\n\ncated as a tumor suppressor because of its residency in chro-\n\nmosome 3p21.31, a region frequently deleted in lung and\n\nother adenocarcinomas (Zabarovsky et al., 2002). Coincidently,\n\nBAF155 expression is deficient in two ovarian cancer cell\n\nlines, SKOV3 and SNUC2B (DelBove et al., 2011). However,\n\nmounting evidence supports that, for at least some tumor\n\ntypes, BAF155 might enhance tumor development. BAF155\n\nexpression is markedly induced in prostate cancer (Lapointe\n\net al., 2004), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (Shadeo et al.,\n\n2008), and colon cancer (Andersen et al., 2009). Elevated\n\nBAF155 expression was correlated with poor prognosis and\n\nrecurrence in colon cancer (Andersen et al., 2009). The varied\n\nBAF155 expression in distinct tumor types suggests that aber-\n\nrant BAF155 levels may contribute to tumor initiation and pro-\n\ngression in a context-dependent manner.\n\nWe report here that BAF155 is elevated in human breast\n\ntumors and that increased methylation of BAF155 is associated\n\nwith poor survival, implicating BAF155 as an independent prog-\n\nnosis biomarker. Individual ChIP experiments showed that some\n\ngenomic sites seem to bind BAF155 independently of BRG1.\n\nFurther ChIP-seq to improve signal/noise ratios and mapping\n\nof genomic sites using anti-me-BAF155 and BRG1 antibodies\n\nwill more fully test BRG1-independent binding of BAF155 to\n\nchromatin sites. Nonetheless, our results support that methyl-\n\nated BAF155 might have functions independent from the full\n\nSWI/SNF complex, which agrees with earlier reports that individ-\n\nual SWI/SNF subunits confer oncogenic functions independently\n\nof the entire complex (Park et al., 2002). For example, BAF53\n\nformed a distinct complex with c-Myc cofactors, including\n\nhistone acetyltransferases to enhance c-Myc\u2019s oncogenic trans-\n\nformation activity (Park et al., 2002). It remains unknown whether\n\nme-BAF155 and SNF5 form complexes distinct fromSWI/SNF at\n\ngenomic loci specific for me-BAF155, including c-Myc pathway\n\ngene loci.\n\nThe c-Myc pathway deregulation is a common feature of\n\nhuman tumorigenesis. The Myc oncoprotein provides selective\n\nadvantages to cancer cells by promoting proliferation, cell sur-\n\nvival, genetic instability, and differentiation blockage, which\n\nall contribute to metastasis. This study reveals that methylated\n\nBAF155 is specifically recruited to c-Myc pathway genes,\n\nsome of which are direct c-Myc targets (e.g., GADD45A) and\n\nsome of which are not (e.g., COL1A2). COL1A2 produces a\n\ncomponent of type I collagen, the pro-a2 (I) chain, involved in in-\n\nflammatory response pathways. COL1A2 was among a \u2018\u2018meta-\n\nsignature\u2019\u2019 associated with breast cancer prognosis (Urquidi\n\nand Goodison, 2007).

Depending on the oncogenic\n\nstress, GADD45A could function as promoter or suppressor for\n\nbreast cancer (Tront et al., 2010). GADD45A promotes tumor\n\nvascularization and growth of Myc-driven breast cancer via\n\nnegative regulation of MMP10 (Tront et al., 2010).\n\nRecently, \u2018\u2018poor prognosis\u2019\u2019 gene expression signatures in\n\ncancer, particularly in breast cancer, were found to reflect the\n\nactivity of the c-Myc oncoprotein, which in turn regulates tumor\n\nmetastasis through regulation of metastasis-relevant target\n\ngenes and/or globally altering the epigenomic landscape of\n\ncancer cells (Wolfer et al., 2010). BAF155 methylation affects\n\nexpression of a number of genes involved in metastasis. Inter-\n\nestingly, another study using the MDA-MB-231 cell line model\n\nshowed that c-Myc knockdown had modest effects on primary\n\ntumor growth, whereas metastatic behavior and distant lung\n\nmetastasis were greatly inhibited (Wolfer et al., 2010). This\n\nstudy suggests that c-Myc is essential for maintaining an inva-\n\nsive and migratory state of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231\n\ncells. Future studies will determine whether BAF155-methyl-\n\nation-sensitive metastatic genes are directly regulated by\n\nc-Myc. Given that 10%\u201315% of genomic loci in mammals are\n\nbound by c-Myc (Zeller et al., 2006), it is plausible that c-Myc\n\naffects metastasis-relevant gene expression via direct tran-\n\nscriptional regulation mechanism or via global alteration of\n\nchromatin structure of cancer cells, thus promoting the meta-\n\nstatic phenotype.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\nGeneration of CARM1 KO Cells\n\nCells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated ZFN\n\npairs using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 72 hr. Single-cell clones were\n\nisolated by limiting dilution of the ZFN-treated pool. The whole cell lysate of\n\neach clone was collected and CARM1 levels were detected by western blot.\n\nTo analyze genomic DNA sequences of each positive clone, the target\n\nlocus was first amplified by PCR using primers CARM1-ZFN-sense: 50-\nACAGCCTGCCTTCTCAGG-30, anti-sense: 50-TGCACAGCAATGGCAAGT-30.\nThen the PCR product was cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector.
