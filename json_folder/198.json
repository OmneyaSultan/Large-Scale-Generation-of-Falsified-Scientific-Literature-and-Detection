Chemopreventive effects of caffeine and curcumin \nwere evaluated in the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced \nhepatocarcinogenic rat model. Animals injected with DEN \nfor 10 weeks (G2-10w) and 14 weeks (G2-14w) were hepato-\ncarcinogenic rats. Animals injected with DEN and treated \nwith curcumin and caffeine for 10 weeks (G3-10w, G4-10w) \nand 14 weeks (G3-14w, G4-14w) were compared with those \nin G2. Macroscopic and microscopic features suggested that \ntreatment with caffeine, but not curcumin, for 10 and 14 weeks \nwas effective in inhibiting DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. \nImmunohistochemical and western blot analysis with proli-\nferating cell nuclear antigen and glutathione S-transferase-P \nantibodies also showed that expression levels of these hepato-\ncarcinogenic markers were more efficiently reduced by \ntreatment with caffeine than curcumin. Our data demonstrate \nthat caffeine could be a more potent compound than curcumin \nfor prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis in DEN-induced rats.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common \nmalignant tumors in the world, representing the third leading \ncause of death from cancer (1,2) and the fifth most prevalent \nmalignancy worldwide (3). Owing to advances in diagnostics \nand therapeutics, HCC can be curatively treated when detected \nat an early stage by applying therapies including radiofrequency \n\nablation (RFA), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization \n(TACE) and surgical resection. However, curative treat-\nments are often hampered by frequent recurrence of HCC (4) \nbecause the remaining liver retains the potential for de novo \ncarcinogenesis (5). Although systemic chemotherapy has also \nbeen challenged to patients with advanced stages of HCC, it is \nmostly ineffective (6). Although sorafenib, one of molecular \ntargeted therapies, has been introduced in the clinical field \nrecently (7), effective therapeutic compounds exactly targeting \nkey molecules involved in hepatocarcinogenesis have not been \ndiscovered yet.\n\nCurcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a natural yellow compound \nderived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa Linn. Curcumin, \ncommonly called turmeric, has been widely used as a spice \nand coloring agent in food such as curry. Recently, curcumin \nhas been demonstrated to possess a chemopreventive potential \nagainst a variety of cancers including skin (8), colorectal (9), \noral (10), stomach (11) and mammary glands (12). Although \nchemopreventive effects of curcumin against murine and rat \nhepatocellular carcinoma models have also been demonstrated \n(13-15), information on the mechanisms of curcumin's preven-\ntive effects against hepatocarcinogenesis is limited.\n\nCaffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a purine alkaloid \npresent in many popular beverages including cocoa, tea and \ncoffee, which may well be the most frequently ingested neuro-\nactive drug in the world (16). There is a growing body of evidence \nthat caffeine has beneficial effects on the liver. Consumption of \ncoffee was associated with a lower incidence of chronic liver \ndisease (17) and a reduced risk of HCC (18-23). Preventative \neffects of caffeine in rodent HCC models have been demon-\nstrated (24-26). However, the exact molecular mechanisms by \nwhich caffeine exerts beneficial effects on hepatocarcinogenesis \nare poorly defined.\n\nDiethylnitrosamine (DEN) is present in tobacco smoke, \nwater, cured and fried meals, agricultural chemicals, cosmetics \nand pharmaceutical agents (27). DEN is an established powerful \nhepatocarcinogen in rats possibly by altering the DNA structure, \nforming alkyl DNA adducts and inducing chromosomal aber-\nrations and micronuclei in the liver (28,29). Although a single \ninjection of DEN followed by partial hepatectomy coupled with \n2-acetyl-aminofluorene (2-AAF) is an established procedure \nfor developing HCC in rodents (30), sequential administration \nof DEN for several weeks has also been employed for inducing \nHCC (13,31).\n\nPreventive effect of caffeine and curcumin on hepato\u00ad\ncarcinogenesis in diethylnitrosamine\u00adinduced rats\n\nYUKI FUJISE,  JUN-ICHI OKANO,  TAKAKAZU NAGAHARA,  RYO ABE, \nRYU IMAMOTO  and  YOSHIKAZU MURAWAKI\n\nSecond Department of Internal Medicine, Tottori University School of Medicine, Tottori 683-8504, Japan\n\nReceived November 11, 2011;  Accepted December 30, 2011\n\nDOI: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1343\n\nCorrespondence to: Dr Jun-Ichi Okano, Second Department of \nInternal Medicine, Tottori University School of Medicine, 36-1 \nNishi-cho, Yonago, Tottori 683-8504, Japan\nE-mail: okanoj@hotmail.co.jp\n\nAbbreviations: ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate \naminotransferase; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; DEN, diethylnitros-\namine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; H&E, hematoxylin and \neosin; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; HCV, hepatitis C virus; PBS, \nphosphate-buffered saline; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; \nVEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor\n\nKey words: hepatocarcinogenesis, diethylnitrosamine, caffeine, \ncurcumin\n\n\n\nFUJISE et al:  EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE AND CURCUMIN ON DEN-INDUCED HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS1780\n\nIn the present study, we sought to determine whether \ncurcumin and caffeine had a potential to prevent DEN-induced \nhepatocarcinogenesis in Wistar rats.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nChemicals. Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) and curcumin \n(diferuloylmethane) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical \nIndustries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Pentobarbital was purchased \nfrom Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). \nDEN and an anti-\u03b2-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma \nAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Antibodies against proliferating \ncell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and glutathione S-transferase \n(GST)-P were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. \n(Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI, \nUSA), respectively. Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horse-\nradish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies for western blot analysis \nwere obtained from GE Healthcare, Ltd. (Buckinghamshire, \nUK). All other chemicals and solvents used in this study were \nof analytical grade.\n\nAnimals, treatments and tissue collection. Male Wistar \nrats weighing ~200 g were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc. \n(Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan). All animals received humane \ncare and protocols were approved by the Tottori University \nAnimal Ethics Committee. The animals were randomized, \ndivided into eight groups (Fig. 1) and housed two per cage with \nrice husks for bedding in an air-ventilated room under a 12-h \nlight/dark cycle with constant temperature (22\u02daC) and humidity \n(55%). The animals were allowed free access to food and tap \nwater ad libitum during the experiment. Animals in group 1 \n(G1) were intraperitoneally injected with 300 \u00b5l of phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS) weekly for 10 weeks (G1-10w, n=2) and \n14 weeks (G1-14w, n=2). Animals in group 2 (G2), group 3 (G3) \nand group 4 (G4) were intraperitoneally injected with DEN \n(40 mg/kg body weight) dissolved in PBS weekly for 10 weeks \n(G2-10w, G3-10w, G4-10w; n=6 in each group) and 14 weeks \n(G2-14w, G3-14w, G4-14w; n=6 in each group). In G3-10w and \nG3-14w, the rats were fed with 0.25% curcumin in powder form \nfor 10 and 14 weeks, respectively. In G4-10w and G4-14w, the \nrats were given drinking water containing 0.02% caffeine for \n10 and 14 weeks, respectively. Body weights, food consumption \nand water intake were monitored weekly throughout the experi-\nmental period. One week after 10- and 14-week treatments, \nanimals were sacrificed under anesthesia by pentobarbital. \nBlood samples were withdrawn via cardiac puncture and serum \nsamples were stored at -30\u02daC until analysis. Immediately after \nthe livers were excised, they were divided into two sections for \nhistological examination in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and \nfor protein studies at -80\u02daC.\n\nMeasurement of serum transaminase. Serum aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \nlevels were measured at SRL, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan).\n\nTotal protein preparation and western blotting. The liver \nsamples were mashed with BioMasher (Nippi, Inc., Tokyo, \nJapan) and lysed in radioimmune precipitation (RIPA) buffer \n(Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA) supplemented with \n1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \n\nfluoride (PMSF) and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche \nDiagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) for 10 min on ice. Total protein \nsamples (5 \u00b5g) were separated on a sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS)-\npolyacrylamide gel (PAGE) (SuperSep, Wako Pure Chemical \nIndustries, Ltd.) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride \n(PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.). After \nthe membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk (Santa Cruz \nBiotechnology, Inc.) in TBST (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, \npH 8.0 and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature, they \nwere probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u02daC, washed \nthree times in TBST and incubated with anti-mouse or anti-\nrabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody in TBST for 1 h \nat room temperature. After the signals were developed with \na chemiluminescence solution (ECL, GE Healthcare, Ltd.), \n\nFigure 1. Experimental schedules. Experimental schedules of the G1-G4 groups \nare demonstrated. (A) Animals in group 1 (G1-10w) were intraperitoneally \ninjected with 300 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) weekly for 10 weeks \n(n=2). Animals in group 2 (G2-10w), group 3 (G3-10w) and group 4 (G4-10w) \nwere intraperitoneally injected with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (40 mg/kg \nbody weight) in PBS weekly for 10 weeks (n=6 in each group). The rats in \nG3-10w were fed with 0.25% curcumin for 10 weeks. The rats in G4-10w were \ngiven drinking water containing 0.02% caffeine for 10 weeks. The rats were \nsacrificed one week after the last treatment. (B) Animals in group 1 (G1-14w) \nwere intraperitoneally injected with 300 \u00b5l of PBS weekly for 14 weeks \n(n=2). Animals in group 2 (G2-14w), group 3 (G3-14w) and group 4 (G4-14w) \nwere intraperitoneally injected with DEN (40 mg/kg body weight) in PBS \nweekly for 14 weeks (n=6 in each group). The rats in G3-14w were fed with \n0.25% curcumin for 14 weeks. The rats in G4-14w were given drinking water \ncontaining 0.02% caffeine for 14 weeks. The rats were sacrificed one week \nafter the last treatment.

The rat liver tissues were \nfixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. \nFor histologic analysis, serial sections (5 \u00b5m) were stained with \nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Neoplastic nodules and HCC \nwere classified on the basis of the published criteria (32). For \nimmunohistochemistry with the PCNA and GST-P antibodies, \nHistofine\u00ae Simple Stain Rat MAX PO was employed (Nichirei \nBiosciences, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, after routine dewaxing \n\nwith xylene and hydration through a graded ethanol series, the \nsections were incubated with 1.5% hydrogen peroxide solution \nfor 15 min at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxi-\ndase activity. The sections were washed in PBS, blocked with \n1.5% serum solution and incubated with primary antibodies \novernight at 4\u02daC. After rinsing with PBS, the sections were \nincubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min at \nroom temperature and horse HRP-conjugated ABC solution \n(Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) was applied \nfor 30 min at room temperature. The peroxidase activity \nwas developed with DAB solution (Vector Laboratories, \n\nFigure 2. Relative liver weight and serum transaminase levels.

Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. The \nPCNA labeling indices were represented as the percentage \nof positively stained nuclei by counting 1000 cells in field at \nmagnification x200. The GST-P-positive area was measured on \nimages captured by a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera \non a Windows\u00ae computer.\n\nStatistical analysis. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. \nValues between two groups were compared using the Mann-\nWhitney U-test. Statistical significance was inferred at P<0.05.\n\nResults\n\nRelative liver weight and serum transaminase levels. All rats \nsurvived throughout the experimental period. Relative liver \nweight (liver weight/body weight) was significantly higher in G2 \nthan G1 at both 10 and 14 weeks, presumably due to the develop-\nment of liver tumors (Fig. 2A). Relative liver weight demonstrated \na trend to be decreased by treatment with curcumin (G3) and \ncaffeine (G4) for 10 and 14 weeks, although this reduction did \nnot reach a statistically significant difference (Fig. 2A).\n\nSerum transaminase levels (AST and ALT) were signifi-\ncantly higher in G2 than G1 at both 10 and 14 weeks, probably \nreflecting hepatic injury induced by DEN (Fig. 2B). Although \ntreatment with curcumin (G3) and caffeine (G4) for 10 weeks \ndid not significantly inhibit the DEN-induced elevation of serum \ntransaminase levels, AST was significantly suppressed by the \ntreatment with curcumin (G3) and caffeine (G4) for 14 weeks \n(Fig. 2B). These data imply a promising result that curcumin \nand caffeine may have some preventive effects on DEN-induced \nhepatitis and hepatocarcinogenesis.\n\nMacroscopic and histological examinations. Macroscopic and \nmicroscopic features of the liver in the four treatment groups \nwere examined after 10 and 14 weeks. In the control rats \n\n(G1-10w, G1-14w), no tumors were observed (Figs. 3A and 4A) \nand the liver histology showed normal appearance (Figs. 3B \nand 4B). In the DEN-treated rats for 10 weeks (G2-10w, \nG3-10w and G4-10w), white small nodules were macroscopi-\ncally observed (Fig. 3A). In histological analysis, hyperplastic \nnodules were developed in G2-10w, G3-10w and G4-10w, \nrevealing no significant difference in the number of nodules \namong these three groups (Fig. 3B). In the DEN-treated rats \nfor 14 weeks (G2-14w, G3-14w and G4-14w), the number and \nsize of white nodules were obviously enhanced compared \nto those at 10 weeks (Fig. 4A). Gross appearance of G2-14w \nand G3-14w was mostly identical. However, the number and \nsize of white nodules in G4-14w were significantly decreased \ncompared to those of G2-14w and G3-14w. White nodules at \n14 weeks were histologically proven to be HCC in G2-14w \nand G3-14w (Fig. 4B). Concordant with macroscopic findings, \nHCC area was significantly smaller in G4-14w than G2-14w \nand G3-14w (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that caffeine, but \nnot curcumin, may have preventive effects on DEN-induced \nhepatocarcinogenesis.\n\nExpression levels of PCNA. PCNA is an essential regulator of \nthe cell cycle, whose expression has been a useful tool to study \ncell proliferation including the liver (33). We compared the \nexpression levels of PCNA in the liver among the four treat-\nment groups. As expected, immunohistochemical analysis \nrevealed that PCNA-positive cells were scarcely observed \nin the control liver at 10 and 14 weeks (G1-10w and G1-14w) \n(Figs. 5A and 6A). After the treatment with DEN for 10 weeks, \nPCNA-positive cells were significantly increased (G2-10w). \nAlthough the number of PCNA-positive cells was not signi-\nficantly modulated after the treatment with curcumin for \n10 weeks (G3-10w), it was significantly suppressed after the \ntreatment with caffeine for 10 weeks (G4-10w) compared to \nG2-10w (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis mostly recapitulated \n\nFigure 3. Macroscopic and microscopic features of the liver at 10 weeks.

Expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were evalu-\nated in the liver at 10 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis (A) and western blot analysis (B). (A) Expression levels of PCNA in the liver were evaluated \nin the control (G1-10w), after treated with DEN (G2-10w), after treated with DEN combined with curcumin (G3-10w) and after treated with DEN combined \nwith caffeine (G4-10w) at 10 weeks. Arrows indicate representative PCNA-positive nuclei. Percentages of PCNA-positive cells in G1-10w, G2-10w, G3-10w \nand G4-10w are 0, 17.0, 20.5 and 10.6%, respectively. Original magnification, x200. (B) Representative liver samples from four treatment groups (G1-10w, \nG2-10w, G3-10w and G4-10w) were probed with anti-PCNA antibody (top lane). The membrane was reprobed with anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (bottom lane). n.s., \nnot significant; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; W, weeks; *P<0.05.\n\n\n\nFUJISE et al:  EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE AND CURCUMIN ON DEN-INDUCED HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS1784\n\nthese results obtained from immunohistochemical analysis \nexcept that control samples (G1-10w) showed a trace of PCNA \nexpression, probably due to different sensitivity of these two \nmethods (Fig. 5B).\n\nWe then evaluated the effects of treatment with curcumin \nand caffeine at 14 weeks. When the rats were treated with \nDEN for 14 weeks, the number of PCNA-positive nuclei was \nenhanced compared to that for 10 weeks, which was concordant \nwith above-described macroscopic and microscopic features \n(Fig. 6A, G2-14w). It is interesting to note that treatment with \ncurcumin (G3-14w) and caffeine (G4-14w) significantly inhi-\nbited the expression of PCNA in the DEN-treated liver sections \n(Fig. 6A). This finding was confirmed by western blot analysis \n(Fig. 6B). These results imply that curcumin and caffeine may \nbe effective for preventing DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis \nin rats and caffeine appears to be a more potent compound than \ncurcumin.\n\nExpression levels of GST-P. Among glutathione S-transferases \n(GSTs), a family of detoxification enzymes catalyzing the \nconjugation of glutathione with a large number of carcinogens, \n\nplacental GST (GST-P) is specifically expressed during rat \nhepatocarcinogenesis, and has been used as a reliable tumor \nmarker for experimental hepatocarcinogenesis in rats (34). \nWe therefore examined the expression levels of GST-P in the \nfour treatment groups at 10 and 14 weeks. As expected, GST-P \nwas not expressed in the control liver samples (G1-10w and \nG1-14w) by either immunohistochemical (Figs. 7A and 8A) or \nwestern blot analysis (Figs. 7B and 8B). The GST-P-positive \narea appeared in the DEN-treated liver at 10 weeks (G2-10w, \nFig. 7A), which became more evident at 14 weeks (G2-14w, \nFig. 8A). Western blot analysis confirmed induction of GST-P by \nthe treatment with DEN for 10 and 14 weeks (Figs. 7B and 8B). \nExpression levels of GST-P were not significantly modified by \nthe treatment with curcumin for 10 weeks (G3-10w) compared to \nG2-10w (Fig. 7A). It was observed that GST-P-positive area was \nsignificantly reduced by the treatment with caffeine for 10 weeks \n(G4-10w) compared to that of G2-10w (Fig. 7A). Western blot \nanalysis mostly recapitulated these effects of curcumin and \ncaffeine on the GST-P expression (Fig. 7B).\n\nFinally, effects of curcumin and caffeine were evaluated \nafter 14 weeks of the treatment. Treatment with curcumin for \n\nFigure 6. Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in the liver at 14 weeks.

However, treat-\nment with caffeine for 14 weeks was able to inhibit the GST-P \nexpression induced by DEN (Fig. 8). These results suggest again \nthat caffeine could be a more potent compound than curcumin \nfor prevention of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSince the vast majority of HCC is complicated with chronic liver \ndiseases including chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis associ-\nated with infection with HBV and HCV, regular surveillance \nof patients who are at high risk of HCC by ultrasonography and \ncomputed tomography (CT) has been proposed in Japan for \nearly detection of HCC (35). Despite the surveillance program, \nHCC is often diagnosed at advanced stages and the prognosis \nof patients with HCC is still unsatis factory. Therefore, effec-\ntive chemopreventive remedy for patients at high risk of HCC \nis awaited to improve the prognosis of patients with chronic \nliver diseases.\n\nCancer chemoprevention is defined as the use of specific \nnatural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse or suppress \ncarcinogenesis and prevent the development of invasive cancer \nby using physiological pathways (36). Phytochemicals, which \nare plant-derived chemicals contained in fruits, vegetables \nand grains, have recently been drawn much attention due to \nanti-tumor activity against a variety of cancers including HCC \n(37). Possible compounds with a potential of chemopreventive \neffects on the liver include caffeine, capsaicin, cinnamaldehyde, \ncurcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), resveratrol, \nsilymarin and sulforaphane (SFN) (38).\n\nCaffeine is the world's most frequently ingested beverage \nwith approximately 80% consumed in the form of coffee (39). \nThere is a growing body of evidence that caffeine has benefi-\ncial effects on the liver. For example, consumption of coffee \nwas associated with a lower incidence of chronic liver disease \n(17) and a reduced risk of HCC (19,22). Although preventa-\ntive effects of caffeine in rodent HCC models have been \ndemonstrated (24,25), exact molecular mechanisms by which \ncaffeine exerts beneficial effects on hepatocarcinogenesis are \npoorly defined except cell cycle arrest (16,40) and induction \n\nFigure 7.

Although chemopreventive \neffects of curcumin against murine and rat HCC models have \nbeen demonstrated (13-15), information on the mechanisms of \ncurcumin's preventive effects against HCC is limited except \nanti-angiogenetic property by suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 \n(COX-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (45), \ninhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (46) and \ninduction of apoptosis (44).\n\nIn the present study, we sought to evaluate whether caffeine \nand curcumin would show benefit in DEN-induced HCC model \nin Wistar rats. We determined the concentration of curcumin \nas 0.25% based on previous studies (13,14) and because when \n\nwe tested administration of 0.5 and 1% curcumin, food intake \nand body weight gain were poor (data not shown). Treatment \nwith 0.25% curcumin for 14 weeks demonstrated week \ninhibitory effects on DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis \nwhen judged from decreased serum AST levels and hepatic \nexpression levels of PCNA. However, the beneficial effects \nof curcumin were marginal. One of the reasons in our study \nmay derive from a low bioavailability of curcumin after oral \nadministration as reported in patients with colorectal cancer \n(47). To achieve high serum and tissue curcumin levels which \nare enough to exert anti-cancer effects, new curcumin delivery \nplatforms such as liposome-encapsulated curcumin (48) have \nto be developed for improving the curcumin bioavailability \nand anticancer potential.\n\nThe concentration of caffeine was determined based on \nprevious studies employing 0.02-0.2% (25,49) and because \nwhen we administered 0.05 and 0.1% caffeine in drinking \nwater in our preliminary studies, water consumption and body \nweight gain were poor (data not shown). Treatment with 0.02% \n\nFigure 8. Expression of glutathione S-transferase-P in the liver at 14 weeks.

These results suggest that caffeine could be a useful \nphytochemical for prevention of HCC.\n\nUnfortunately, we did not examine the molecular mecha-\nnisms by which caffeine and curcumin exhibited anti-cancer \neffects in the DEN-induced HCC model. In our previous in vitro \nstudy, we clarified that caffeine activated the mitogen-activated \nERK-regulating kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated \nkinase (ERK) pathway that resulted in the downstream upregu-\nlation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in HCC \ncells (40). Further investigation of signaling molecules involved \nin anti-cancer effects by caffeine and curcumin in vivo will be \nnecessary.\n\nIn summary, caffeine could be a more potent compound \nthan curcumin for prevention of DEN-induced hepatocarcino-\ngenesis in rats. The doses of these compounds which effectively \ndemonstrate chemopreventive effects without toxicity need to \nbe examined in patients with chronic liver diseases in future \nclinical studies.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Mr. Yujirou Ikuta for his technical \nassistance.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.
