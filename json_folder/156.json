Similarly, cytoplasmic Janus kinases\n(JAKs) seem to play a critical role in diverse signal transduction pathways that govern cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation\nand apoptosis. In this work, we analysed the effects of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium porins on signaling by the JAK/\nSTAT pathway and IL-6 release in U937 cells. Porins and LPS of membrane from Gram-negative bacteria are factors implicated in septic\nshock. In our assays porins induce interleukin-6 (IL-6) release (110 \u00b1 2.6 pg/ml) 24 h after stimulation and STAT1/STAT3 tyrosine\n(Tyr701/Tyr705) and serine (Ser727) phosphorylation after 15 min. By using several selective inhibitors we demonstrate that porins mod-\nulate the activation of STAT1/STAT3 through mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and not JAKs. Furthermore, we demonstrat-\ned that STAT1 and STAT3 are not involved in the modulation of IL-6 release in U937 cells stimulated with porins. Inhibition of\ntyrosine/serine phosphorylation mediated by MAPKs of STAT1 and STAT3 decrease the IL-6 secretion following porin stimulation.\nTherefore, suggesting a key role of this pathway in phosphorylation of Ser 727 in STAT1 and STAT3. These results are confirmed\nby porin or LPS-induced nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT3 in U937 cells.\n\ufffd 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The molecular mechanisms which regulate the\ninteractions of the small peptide mediators with host cells\nare well known, whereas there is little understanding of\nthe mechanisms by which different bacterial products\ninduce similar responses, releasing cytokines and defensins\n[6].\n\nPorins from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium,\nMannheimia haemolytica and Haemophilus influenzae\ninduce tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in\nTHP-1 cells and in macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice [7].\n\nAmong the most prominent tyrosine phosphorylated\nbands in porin-stimulated cells there are a number of pro-\nteins with molecular masses similar to those of the tyrosine/\nserine/threonine protein kinase family. Mitogen-activated\nprotein kinases (MAPKs) and their upstream kinases\nactivate a number of transcription factors and induce tran-\nscription from a variety of inflammatory genes in response\nto LPS and cytokines [8]. MAPKs are kinases that signal\nthe intracellular responses to an array of extracellular stim-\nuli that include mitogens, growth factors, pathogen-derived\nproducts, and other physical stressors.\n\nAdditionally, porins activate the Raf-1-MEK1/2-MAPK\npathway and transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-jB [9].\n\nThe family of transcription factors called STATs (signal\ntransducers and activators of transcription) have been\nfound to be activated by the Janus kinases (JAKs) that\nare associated with the cytokine receptor components\n[10]. In resting cells the STATs, when phosphorylated by\nthe JAKs, dimerize via their SH2 domains and translocate\nto the nucleus, where they interact with specific DNA\nsequences and transactivate the associated genes.\n\nThe ability of STATs to homo-or-hetero-dimerize\nallows cytokine-specific cellular responses [11]. Several\npolypeptide ligands use the JAK-STAT molecules in signal\ntransduction [12]. Four JAKs have been identified in mam-\nmals: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2. They have molecular\nmasses ranging from 120 to 140 kDa and a conserved struc-\nture with distinct regions. Two JAKs of the same or differ-\nent class must be in close proximity for phosphorylation to\noccur. Seven STAT proteins have currently been identified\nin mammalian cells, with molecular masses between 75 and\n95 kDa. Many different models have been used to investi-\ngate the role of JAK/STAT in response to infection in vivo\n[13]. The models range from polymicrobial peritonitis [14]\nand Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection [15], to intraperi-\ntoneal injection of pathogens or their components, such as\nendotoxin [16].\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the ability of por-\nins to directly activate the JAK/STAT signal transduction\npathway and stimulate IL-6 release from U937 cells. The\nresults will contribute to our current knowledge on the\nmechanism and function of JAK/STAT signaling in\nsepsis.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cell lines\n\nU937 monocytes (ATCC CRL-1593.2) were grown at\n37 \ufffdC in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 and differentiated as pre-\nviously described [17]. Cells were tested every 2 weeks by\na PCR-based detection assay for mycoplasma contamina-\ntion [18].\n\n2.2. Bacterial strain\n\nThe bacterial strain used was S. enterica serovar\nTyphimurium SH5014 grown in nutrient broth for 18\u2013\n24 h at 37 \ufffdC under agitation; cells were harvested at the\nend of the exponential growth phase.\n\n2.3. Preparation of porins and LPS\n\nPorins were isolated from the lysozyme\u2013EDTA extract-\ned envelopes of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain\nSH5014 as previously reported [9]. The protein content of\nthe porins preparation was determined by the method of\nLowry et al. [19] and checked by SDS\u2013PAGE according\nto Laemmli [20]. SDS\u2013PAGE revealed two bands with\nmolecular weights of 34 and 36 kDa, confirming the purity\nof the preparation. LPS was isolated using the phenol/chlo-\nroform/ether method described previously [9]. All possible\ntraces of LPS were revealed on SDS\u2013PAGE stained with\nsilver nitrate as described by Tsai and Frasch [21] and by\nthe Limulus-amoebocyte-lysate assay (Limulus test, pbi\ninternational, Milan Italy) according to Yin et al. [22].\n\n2.4. Cell stimulation with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium\n\nporins and LPS for preparation of cell lysates\n\nU937 cells (3 \u00b7 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with differ-\nent concentrations (1, 5 and 10 lg/ml) of stimuli for differ-\nent time periods (15, 30 and 60 min) in 96-well\npolypropylene plates. After incubation, the cells were pre-\npared as previously reported [9] and used for enhanced\nchemiluminescence\u2019s (ECL) Western Blot analysis.\n\n2.5. Kinase phosphorylation\n\nCell lysates were immunoprecipitated and used for wes-\ntern blotting. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with\nthe appropriate antibodies (anti-JAK1, -JAK2, -JAK3,\n-Tyk2, -STAT1, -STAT2, -STAT3, -STAT4, -STAT5,\n-STAT6) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Blots were\nblocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline\n(TBS [150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5]) contain-\ning 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma\u2013Aldrich\nS.r.l., Milano, Italy) plus 1% blotting grade blocker\nnon-fat milk (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and subsequently\nmembranes were washed twice with TBS containing\n0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS) before incubation for 1 h at room\n\n\n\n220 M. Galdiero et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 218\u2013228\ntemperature with anti-phosphoaminoacid monoclonal\nantibodies (anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phosphoserine or\nanti-phosphothreonine antibody; Calbiochem, Novabio-\nchem Corporation, GmbH) diluted in TBS containing 1%\nBSA. After being washed six times with TTBS for 3 min,\nPVDF membranes were incubated at room temperature\nfor 2 h with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG HRP secondary\nantibodies diluted 1:3000. They were then washed six times\nwith TTBS and twice with PBS for 5 min. In some\nexperiments, the same blot was used for detection of\np(Tyr701)STAT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.),\np(Tyr705)STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\nInc.), p(Ser727)STAT1 Upstate Biotechnology (Lake\nPlacid, NY), p(Ser727)STAT3 (New England BioLabs),\np(Tyr1007/1008)JAK2 Upstate Biotechnology (Lake\nPlacid, NY) and p(TyrTyr1054/1055)Tyk2 (Cell Signaling\nTechnology Inc., Beverly, MA) after stripping of the previ-\nous antibody with Restore Western blot stripping buffer\n(Pierce).\n\n2.6. Cytokine release\n\nAll assays were carried out using 3 \u00b7 106/ml U937 cells\nstimulated with different concentrations of stimuli (5 lg/\nml of porins or 1 lg/ml of LPS) for 24 h at 37 \ufffdC in 5%\nCO2; the time points and concentrations have been deter-\nmined in preliminary experiments as that giving maximum\nrelease. After incubation the samples were centrifuged at\n1800 rpm at 4 \ufffdC for 10 min and the supernatants were\ncollected and stored at \ufffd70 \ufffdC. IL-6 release was measured\nby ELISA using pair-matched monoclonal antibodies,\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Roche\nDiagnostic SpA, Milan, Italy).\n\n2.7. Inhibitors of signal transduction\n\nIn some experiments, before stimulation, U937 cells were\npretreated with PD-098059 (New England Biolabs, Inc.), a\nselective inhibitor of MEK1 activator [23]; SB203580 (Cal-\nbiochem, Novabiochem Corporation, GmbH), a specific\ninhibitor of the p38 pathway [24]; AG490 (Calbiochem\u2013\nNovabiochem Corp., CA), a specific JAK inhibitor [25];\nH7, a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor [26]; genistein, a\nbroad-range tyrosine kinase inhibitor [27] for 60 min.\n\n2.8. STATs trans-activation analysis\n\nTo detect and quantify STATs activation in U937 cells,\nwe used ELISA-based Trans-Am transcription factor kits\n(Active Motif, Carlsbad, USA) that exploited a patented\ntechnology to attach an oligonucleotide containing the\nSTAT consensus binding site (5 0-TTCCCGGAA-3 0) to a\n96-well plate according to the transcription factors ana-\nlysed [28]. The active form of STAT contained in cell\nextract specifically binds to this oligonucleotide. The pri-\nmary antibodies used to detect STAT recognize an epitope\non STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A or 5B that accessible only\nwhen the STAT is activated and bound to its target\nDNA. Preparation of nuclear cell extracts was done\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The specific-\nity of the assays was checked by measuring the ability of\nsoluble wild-type or mutated STAT oligonucleotide to\ninhibit binding. In preliminary assays, the Trans-Am kits\nshowed a good correlation with an EMSA in detecting\nthe DNA binding capacity of STATs. The optimal time\nof stimulation (1 h) and amount of porins (5 lg/ml) or\nLPS (1 lg/ml) used in the STAT ELISA were determined\nin preliminary experiments.\n\n2.9. Endotoxin test\n\nAll materials and solutions were tested for LPS by a\nLimulus test as described by Yin et al. [22]. The results of\nthis test was compared with a standard LPS solution which\nwas Limulus test positive at 0.1 EU/ml.\n\n2.10. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay\n\nLDH assays were carried out according to manufactur-\ner\u2019s instructions using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche\nDiagnostic SpA, Milan, Italy).\n\n2.11. Reproducibility\n\nGels were scanned for densitometry analysis by Sigma\nGel software (Sigma\u2013Aldrich S.r.l., Milano, Italy). The\nresults shown are from a single experiment typical of at\nleast three giving similar results. The results were expressed\nas mean values \u00b1 standard errors of three independent\nobservations. Comparisons between cytokine test was done\nby Student\u2019s t-test, with statistical significance considered\nto P 6 0.01 and P 6 0.05 for STATs trans-activation\nanalysis and densitometry analysis of band intensity.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Purity of porin preparations\n\nThe purification of the porin preparation and the even-\ntual contamination by LPS have been amply discussed in\nprevious works [29,30]. Using the Limulus test, the LPS\ncontamination in the porin preparations, used in this study,\nwas estimated to be <0.005% (w/w) compared with a stan-\ndard S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LPS solution. The\nconcentration of porins used in our experimental proce-\ndures, contains a biologically insufficient percentage of\nLPS (about 50 pg/lg of porins), which did not induce\nany enzyme phosphorylation or cytokine release.\n\n3.2. Porin and LPS induce release of IL-6 in U937 cells\n\nIt has been extensively documented that porins have the\nability to stimulate the synthesis and release of pro- and\nanti-inflammatory cytokines [31].\n\n\n\nFig. 1. IL-6 production by U937 cells stimulated with porins or LPS o\nS. enterica serovar Typhimurium. U937 cells (3 \u00b7 106/ml) were no\nstimulated (Control) or stimulated with porins (5 lg/ml) or LPS (1 lg/ml)\nThe IL-6 level was measured by ELISA 24 h after stimulation. Data\npresented are averages from three independent experiments, and the erro\nbars indicate the standard errors of the means (*P 6 0.01; Student\u2019s t-test)\n\nM. Galdiero et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 218\u2013228 221\nf\nt\n.\n\nr\n.\n\nSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium porins (5 lg/ml\nor 0.2 lM) induced IL-6 production (110 \u00b1 2.6 pg/ml) 24 h\nafter stimulation, representing at least 60% of the produc-\ntion obtained with 1 lg/ml (0.5 lM) of LPS (Fig. 1). Time\npoints chosen for IL-6 production were previously opti-\nmized (data not shown). Porin-mediated IL-6 induction\nby U937 cells is not affected by adding the specific LPS-in-\nhibiting oligopeptide Polymyxin B (PMB) (Sigma\u2013Aldrich\nS.r.l., Milano, Italy) (10 lg/ml) [32] to porins prior to stim-\nulation, while LPS-mediated stimulation was abolished in\nthe presence of PMB. This confirms that IL-6 induction\nby porins in U937 cells is not due to contamination by\nLPS (data not shown).\n\n3.3. JAK/STAT phosphorylation by porins\n\nIn order to examine the role of JAK/STAT signaling\npathways for IL-6 release induced by porins in U937 cells,\nwe performed Western blot analyses of JAK/STAT activa-\ntion. U937 cells were treated with either porins (5 lg/ml) or\nLPS (1 lg/ml). The time points and concentrations chosen\nfor phosphoaminoacid analysis of JAKs and STATs were\npreviously optimized (data not shown). The extracts were\nexamined for the presence of tyrosine phosphorylated\nJAKs, and threonine, serine or tyrosine phosphorylated\nSTATs by Western blot analysis.\n\nLPS stimulation induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation\n(1 min, optimal stimulation time) of JAK2 (Tyr1007/1008)\nand Tyk2 (Tyr1054/1055) corresponding to about 80% and\n50% of signaling induced by interferon (IFN)-c (100 U/ml)\n(Roche Diagnostic SpA, Milan, Italy) used as positive con-\ntrol of JAK/STAT activation [12]. On the other hand LPS\nstimulation resulted in no detectable tyrosine phosphoryla-\ntion of JAK1 or JAK3 (Fig. 2).\n\nFollowing 1 min stimulation (optimal stimulation time)\nwith S. enterica serovar Typhimuirum porins, we could\nnot observe any significant immunoprecipitation band\nusing anti-JAK1, anti-JAK2, anti-JAK3 or anti-Tyk2\nantibodies for tyrosine phosphorylation analysis (Fig. 2).\n\nWestern blotting analysis of protein extracts derived\nfrom U937 cells treated for 15 min with either porins\n(5 lg/ml) or LPS (1 lg/ml) revealed several STAT phos-\nphorylated proteins (Fig. 3). The time points and concen-\ntrations chosen were previously optimised. The lysates\nobtained were immunoprecipitated by antibodies that spe-\ncifically recognised STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4,\nSTAT5 or STAT6 enzymes. Immunoblot analyses were\nperformed using anti-phosphothreonine, anti-phosphoser-\nine or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. After stimulation\nwith porins or LPS, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of\nSTAT1 (Tyr701) or STAT3 (Tyr705) were comparable to\nlevels obtained using IFN-c (Fig. 3a). Serine phosphoryla-\ntion analysis of STATs showed immunoprecipitation\nbands with anti-STAT1 and -STAT3 antibodies (Fig. 3b).\nThe levels of STAT1 (Ser727) serine phosphorylation were\ncomparable after stimulation with porins, LPS or IFN-c.\nThe immunoprecipitation with anti-STAT3 followed by\nanti-phosphoserine immunoblotting demonstrated a\nmarked increased serine phosphorylation (about 70%\nrespect to IFN-c) after LPS stimulation. Porin stimulation\ninduced an evident serine phosphorylation of STAT3\n(Ser727) (about 56% respect to IFN-c).\n\nNo phosphorylation of STAT threonine residues was\ndetected after porins or LPS stimulation (data not shown).\n\nWhen the immunoprecipitating antibodies used were\nspecific for STAT2, 4, 5 or 6 no bands were observed for\nanalysis of threonine, serine or tyrosine residue phosphor-\nylation after porin or LPS stimulation (data not shown).\n\nThe specificity of the effect was demonstrated using a\ndifferent protein (BSA) as a stimulus; no phosphoryla-\ntion of the proteins investigated in our study was\nobserved. The possibility that traces of LPS contaminat-\ning the preparation of porins could be responsible for\nthe observed effect can be excluded. The minimum con-\ncentration of LPS able to induce phosphorylation of\nSTAT1 and STAT3 in our in vitro model is 100 ng/ml,\nwhich is much more than the quantity of LPS present\nin our preparation (about 50 pg/lg of porins) (data not\nshown).\n\n3.4. Effect of inhibitors on STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine/\n\nserine phosphorylation in U937 cells stimulated by porins\n\nSince JAKs are not involved in phosphorylation induced\nby porin, to further examine the signaling pathways\ninvolved in STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine and serine phos-\nphorylation by porins, we investigated if other signaling\npathways are involved in both STAT1 and STAT3 phos-\nphorylation in response to a porin stimulus. We tested\nthe effect of different inhibitors: PD-098059 (inhibitor of\nMEK1 activator and MAPK pathway), SB203580 (inhibi-\ntor of p38 pathway), AG490 (JAK inhibitor), H7 (serine/\nthreonine kinase inhibitor) (Fig. 4).\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Western blot analysis of JAKs activation. U937 cells (3 \u00b7 106/ml) were stimulated with either porins, LPS or IFN-c (positive control) for 1 min.\nThe immunoprecipitated proteins for JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2 were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with\nAbs specific for anti-phosphotyrosine. In some experiments, the same blot was used for detection of p(Tyr1007/1008)JAK2 and p(Tyr1054/1055)Tyk2\nafter stripping of the previous antibody. Gels were scanned for densitometry analysis with the Sigma Gel Software, and the ratio of the value for each\nstimulation time to the value for an unstimulated control is shown. The data are averages from three different experiments, and the error bars indicate the\nstandard errors of the means. Band intensity was quantified densitometrically. *P 6 0.05 indicates statistically significant difference compared to IFN-c\nstimulated cells.\n\n222 M. Galdiero et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 218\u2013228\nCells were pretreated for 60 min with PD-098059\n(25 lM) and then stimulated with either porins or LPS.\nFrom cell lysates a decrease in intensity of the immunopre-\ncipitation bands with anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3 antibod-\nies for tyrosine phosphorylation analysis was observed.\nUsing porins the decrease in intensity of the immunopre-\ncipitation bands with anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3 antibod-\nies for tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr701 and Tyr705,\nrespectively) analysis was about 35% (Fig. 4a) and using\nLPS it was about 40% (Fig. 4b).\n\nPretreatment with SB203580 (10 lM for 60 min) prior to\nstimulation with porins or LPS resulted in a considerable\ndecrease in intensity of STAT1 and STAT3 immunoprecip-\nitation bands for tyrosine phosphorylation analysis. The\nintensity of the bands was reduced of about 50% with\neither porins or LPS.\nWhen using AG490, at a concentration of 10 lM for\n60 min, we could not observe any change in the immuno-\nprecipitated bands for tyrosine phosphorylated of STAT1\nor STAT3 after stimulation with porins (Fig. 4a), while\nLPS reduced activation of about 20% (Fig. 4b). The cell\npretreatment with H7 (25 lM for 60 min) modulated both\nporin or LPS-induced STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phos-\nphorylation. For maximal transcriptional activity, STAT1\nand STAT3 need to be phosphorylated on both tyrosine\nand serine residues [33]. To verify STAT1 and STAT3 ser-\nine phosphorylation, U937 cells were pretreated with PD-\n098059, SB203580 or H7 prior to the addition of porins\nor LPS. The results, presented in Fig. 5, indicate that\nPD-098059, reduced the phosphorylation status of STAT1\nor STAT3 serine (about 30% for porins and 35% for LPS)\nas well as the pretreatment with SB203580 (about 50% for\n\n\n\nFig. 3.

Porin-induced nuclear translocation of STAT1 and\n\nSTAT3\n\nExperiments investigate the dimerization by porin or\nLPS-activated STAT1 and STAT3 and the concomitant\nnuclear translocation of dimers in U937 cells were carried\nout. The results obtained showed that increased specific\nbinding of active STAT1 or STAT3 (Fig. 6) were detected\nin U937 lysates 1 h after stimulation with porins (5 lg/ml)\nor LPS (1 lg/ml).\n\nFurther experiments were performed to ascertain\nwhether MAPKs had a role in the binding of STAT1 and\nSTAT3 to DNA by porins. Specifically, we looked at the\neffects of the PD-098059, SB203580, AG490 and H7 inhib-\nitors on binding of STAT1 and STAT3 to a consensus\nbinding site. PD-098059 pretreatment was effective in\ndecreased STAT1 or STAT3 porin or LPS-mediated nucle-\nar translocation (about 37% for porins and about 45% for\nLPS). The pretreatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580\ndecreased porin or LPS stimulated STAT1 or STAT3 bind-\ning to DNA (50%), suggesting that the functionality of\nthese proteins requires the activation of p38 pathway. Fur-\nthermore, the results presented in Fig. 6, indicate that\nAG490, had a decreasing effect on STAT1 and STAT3\nDNA binding induced by LPS (22%). On the contrary,\nno effect was evidenced on STAT1 or STAT3 nuclear\ntranslocation following porin stimulation.\n\nWe finally investigated the effect of H7 on the induction\nof porin- or LPS-mediated nuclear translocation of STAT1\nor STAT3. Treatment of U937 cells with H7 partially sup-\npressed porin or LPS induction of STAT1 binding to a\nconsensus binding site (30%) (Fig. 6). Moreover, H7 pre-\ntreatment caused an evident inhibition of STAT3 LPS-\nmediated DNA binding (70%), while modulated the porin\neffect on STAT3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 6).\n3.6. MAPK and not JAKs are involved in IL-6 production in\n\nU937 cells stimulated by porins\n\nTo further examine the signaling pathways involved in\nIL-6 release by porins and LPS, U937 cells were incubated\nwith specific inhibitors of ERK1/ERK2 (PD-098059,\n25 lM for 60 min), p38 MAPKs (SB203580, 10lM for\n60 min), JAKs (AG490, 10 lM for 60 min), a serine/threo-\nnine kinase inhibitor (H7, 25 lM for 60 min) or a total\nPTKs inhibitor (genistein, 50 lM for 60 min) before being\nFig. 4.

The optimal concen-\ntrations of inhibitors were calculated according to 50%\ninhibitory concentration (IC50) values and specificities\nreported in literature [23\u201327]. As shown in Fig. 7, the\npretreatment with PD-098059 or SB203580 prior to\nstimulation with either porins or LPS induced a modest\neffect on IL-6 release. The pretreatment with both inhibi-\ntors simultaneously caused a clear decrease in IL-6 release\nafter 24 h. The inhibitor AG490 modified slightly IL-6\nrelease, confirming that porins did not activate the JAKs\npathway unlike LPS. The serine/threonine kinase inhibitor\n(H7) or the broad-range tyrosine kinase inhibitor (geni-\nstein) reduced markedly IL-6 release suggesting that tyro-\nsine phosphorylation of STATs in this system involves a\ntyrosine kinase other than JAK family members [34], and\nthat the action of the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor is\ndirected to a kinase required for incrementing activation\nof other tyrosine kinases.\n\nMoreover, treatments with these concentrations of\ninhibitors did not significantly affect the basal level of IL-\n6 secretion, strongly indicating that pharmacological\nresults in this study were not contaminated by non-specific\ncell damage, as confirmed by LDH assay (data not shown).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nMany different models of sepsis have been used to inves-\ntigate the role of STATs and JAKs in response to infection.\nThe results obtained using these models of infection have\nall contributed to the current knowledge on the mechanism\nand function of JAK/STAT signaling in sepsis [11]. LPS\nand porins of Gram-negative bacteria are key factors impli-\ncated in septic shock [31]. Our results from in vitro experi-\nments on U937 cells demonstrate a complex indirect\nmechanism of STAT1 and STAT3 activation after stimula-\ntion of cells with either porins or LPS. The treatment with\nporins did not results in increase of JAK phosphorylation\nalthough a significant increase in precipitation bands for\nphosphotyrosine STAT1 and STAT3 was observed. Using\nseveral inhibitors, we demonstrated that the activation of\nSTAT1 and STAT3 by porins can occur through the acti-\nvation of MAPK and possibly other PTKs [34] but not\nthrough JAK activation. In our experiments, both the\nERKs and p38 MAPK are involved in the activation of\nSTAT1 and STAT3 by porins or LPS, while STAT2,\nSTAT4, STAT5 and STAT6 did not demonstrate any acti-\nvation under our experimental conditions.

Analysis of the effects of different inhibitors on binding of STAT1 and STAT3 to an STATs-binding consensus sequence. U937 cells were\nstimulated with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium porins or LPS in the absence or presence of an ERK 1/2 inhibitor (PD-098059, 100 lM) (PD), or a p38\ninhibitor (SB203580, 10 lM) (SB), or a JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor (AG490, 10 lM for 60 min) (AG) or a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor (H7, 25 lM\nfor 60 min). Cell lysates (10 lg/ml) were tested for binding of the activated STAT1 or STAT3 to an STATs consensus sequence using the Trans-Am\nSTATs family ELISA kit. The experiment was performed in the presence of soluble wild-type or mutated consensus oligonucleotides. The results are\nexpressed as specific binding (absorbance measured in the presence of the mutated oligonucleotide minus that measured in the presence of the wild-type\noligonucleotide). The results are shown as means \u00b1 standard errors of triplicate determinations (*P 6 0.05; Student\u2018s t-test).\n\n226 M. Galdiero et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 218\u2013228\nphosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 induced by porins\nor LPS resulted in only a minor difference. Whereas LPS\nappeared to be superior to porins with respect to induction\nof STAT1/STAT3 activation by ERK1/ERK2 mediation,\nporins induced significantly more phosphorylation of\nSTAT1/STAT3 and IL-6 release through p38. Moreover,\nthe pretreatment with H7 or genistein decreased IL-6 secre-\ntion mediated by porins or LPS, indicating that both tyro-\nsine kinases and serine/threonine kinases are essential for\nIL-6 production. Although porins and LPS signal through\ndifferent surface receptors [35,36], our data show that there\nare also differences between the tyrosine kinase signaling\npathways by which porins and LPS are able to activate\ncells. Our results suggest that JAK2 and Tyk2 phosphory-\nlation is only required for IL6 production LPS-induced,\nbut they are not required following porin-induction. This\nlends weight to the hypothesis of a different cellular\nmechanism exerted by porins in contrast to LPS, as also\ndescribed in previous works [9,30,35,36].\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that bacterial infec-\ntion of macrophages, or treatment with LPS resulted in\nrapid STAT1 phosphorylation in Serine727 independently\nof concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in\nTyr701 [10]. Serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of\nSTAT1 occur independently of each other, but the serine\nkinase may recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1\npreferentially in the course of an IFN-c response [37]. Max-\nimal activation of transcription by STAT1 and STAT3\nrequire both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation [33].\nFor STAT dimer formation and DNA binding is necessary\n\n\n\nFig. 7.

Galdiero et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 218\u2013228 227\ntyrosine phosphorylation [28]. Cytokine- and growth fac-\ntor-induced STAT activation is mainly dependent of JAKs\nphosphorylation, while porins do not use these tyrosine\nkinases. Our results show that STAT1 and STAT3, after\nporin stimulation, are phosphorylated at tyrosine residues\n(Tyr701 and Tyr705, respectively) probably through other\nPTKs [34]; in fact treating cells with genistein, a wide spec-\ntrum inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, IL-6 release becomes\nstrongly reduced. Early post-receptor events in porins\nand LPS induced signal transduction involve tyrosine\nphosphorylation [7,38], but it is unclear which tyrosine\nkinases are critically involved in the down-stream signal\ntransduction pathways. In addition to the tyrosine kinases,\na number of serine kinases was previously shown to be acti-\nvated by porins and LPS, including c-Raf, the MAPKs\nERK1 and ERK2, the p38 kinase, c-Jun kinase [9]. Our\nexperiments also show serine (Ser727) phosphorylation of\nSTAT1 and STAT3. Moreover, MAPKs inhibitors reduce,\nwith a different extent, IL-6 release, pointing out a key role\nof this pathway in phosphorylation of Ser727 in STAT1\nand STAT3.\n\nThese results are confirmed by nuclear translocation of\nSTAT1 and in porin or LPS-stimulated U937 cells. Several\npublished data show that MAPKs have specific roles in\nphosphorylation of Ser727 of STATs [39]. Porins and\nLPS while not directly influencing the out-put of the\nJAK/STAT signal transduction pathway, are able to play\nan important role in the activation of macrophages as a\nresult of the stimulation with early cytokines release and\na previous stimulus such as a microbial product (e.g. por-\nins, LPS). Porins, as also LPS, activates also others tran-\nscriptional factors such as AP-1 and NF-jB [9], that\nplays a central role in the transcriptional activation of\nnumerous genes encoding immunologically and pro-in-\nflammatory important cytokines or other mediators. In\nour in vitro experiments we have not found evidence of\nphosphorylation of STATs 2, 4, 5 or 6, although they are\ndramatically modified in infection and especially during\nsepsis [11]. The in vivo conditions which occur during sepsis\ncan probably not be reproduced in vitro, where we are able\nto separate an immune response following a porin stimula-\ntion from the whole response which is also influenced by\nthe released cytokines. In conclusion the results obtained\nin this work demonstrate that signaling in cellular activa-\ntion can be directly influenced by bacterial components\nand that also early cytokines, released by the effect of the\nsame bacterial components, can interfere with signaling\npathways.\nReferences\n\n[1] Elias D, Wolday D, Akuffo H, Petros B, Bronner U, Britton S.
