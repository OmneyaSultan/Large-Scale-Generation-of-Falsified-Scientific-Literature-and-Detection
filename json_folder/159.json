Our aim was to determine the distribution of IL-19 expression and to delineate the cell types that\nexpress IL-19 in healthy and neoplastic tissue, because this information will significantly facilitate the\nexploration of its pathophysiological functions. We used tissue microarray technology and an immuno-\nhistochemical survey with an anti-IL-19 monoclonal antibody to examine the expression of IL-19 in 28\nhealthy and 15 neoplastic tissues. IL-19 protein was positively stained in 15 healthy tissue types and\nthree major cell types: epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages. We also found that several\ntypes of tumor cells were positively stained for IL-19, especially in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of\nthe skin, tongue, esophagus, and lung. SCC of the oral cavity expressed IL-19 mRNA and its receptors.\nIn two cell lines derived from SCC of oral cavity tumor tissue, IL-19 specifically activated an intracellular\nsignal and induced proliferation of the cells, which indicated that IL-19 may act in an autocrine manner in\nSCC tumors. This study provides important references for further investigation of the biological functions\nand clinical implications of IL-19 in humans.\n\n\ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nInterleukin (IL)-19, a recently discovered interleukin [1], be-\nlongs to the IL-10 family: IL-10, -19, -20, -22, -24 (MDA-7), and -\n26 (AK155). Despite a partial homology in their amino acid se-\nquences, they are dissimilar in their biological functions [1\u20135]. At\npresent, only a few biological functions and clinical implications\nof IL-19 are known. One important cellular source of IL-19 are\nmonocytes, in which lipopolysaccharide (LPS), granulocyte\u2013macro-\nphage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-6, and tumor necro-\nsis factor (TNF)-a upregulate IL-19 expression [6,7]. Although the\nfunctions of IL-19 are not well understood, we do know that it in-\nll rights reserved.\n\n5 from the Chi-Mei Medical\nNational Science Council,\n\nBiochemistry and Molecular\nof Medicine, Tainan 70428,\n\nChang).\nduces monocytes to produce IL-6 and TNF-a [8] and CD4-positive\n(+) T cells to produce Th2 cytokines, which are associated with\nasthma [9]. IL-19 also induces apoptosis in lung epithelial cells,\nstimulates liver cells to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS),\nand promotes neutrophil chemotaxis [10]. Clinically, IL-19 is in-\nduced in post-cardiopulmonary bypass inflammatory response\nand severe sepsis, which indicates that IL-19 may be involved in\nthe pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory diseases [7,10]. Fur-\nthermore, IL-19 dose-dependently upregulated IL-4 and downreg-\nulated interferon (IFN)-c [11], which suggested that IL-19 altered\nthe balance of Th1 and Th2 cells in favor of Th2 cells. The expres-\nsion of IL-19 is also correlated with Th2 cytokine production in pa-\ntients with uremia [12].\n\nIL-19 has been found in the local tissue of inflammatory lesions.\nHuman psoriatic epidermis tissue samples showed prominent\nIL-19 immunostaining in their hyperproliferative keratinocytes\n[13]. In addition, IL-19 upregulated keratinocyte growth factor\n(KGF) expression in CD8+ T cells [13], which suggested that IL-19\nis involved in modulating keratinocyte proliferation. Moreover,\nthe difference in IL-19 expression between healthy and diseased\n\nmailto:mschang@mail.ncku.edu.tw\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\nTable 2\nTumor cells stained for IL-19 in neoplastic tissue\n\nTumor type IL-19 immunostaining\n\n1.

There are currently no published comprehensive sur-\nveys of IL-19 expression in healthy or diseased human tissue or\ncell types.\n\nA recently developed tissue microarray (TMA) technology\u2014a\nminiaturized pathology archive for high-throughput in situ studies\n[14,15]\u2014allows a massive acceleration of correlating molecular in\nsitu findings with clinicopathological information. Sections from\nTMA blocks can be used for different types of in situ tissue analysis,\nincluding immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization [14\u2013\n16]. The tissue microarray approach is useful in surveys of tumor\npopulations and can be used to comprehensively analyze the func-\ntions of newly identified genes in both healthy and neoplastic hu-\nman tissue [15\u201317]. To explore the relation between IL-19 and\nbiological functions in human, we developed monoclonal antibod-\nies against human IL-19. Using TMA and immunohistochemical\nstaining with these antibodies, we surveyed IL-19 expression in\nhealthy and neoplastic human tissues.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Human tissue microarrays\n\nCommercialized tissue microarrays (TMAs) (Pantomics, Inc, San\nFrancisco, CA) with 28 types of healthy human tissue (Table 1)\nwere used for immunohistochemical staining. The TMAs were de-\nsigned following the FDA-recommended healthy tissue panel for\nantibody cross-reactivity testing described in the manufacturer\u2019s\nTable 1\nImmunostaining of IL-19 in healthy tissue\n\nEpithelial\ncells\n\nEndothelial\ncells\n\nMacrophagesa Others\n\n1.

Tumor TMAs were obtained from the Pathology\nDepartment of the National Cheng Kung University Medical Col-\nlege. Fifteen neoplastic (Table 2) tissue samples, formalin-fixed\nand paraffin-embedded, were retrieved from the archive. There\nwere three samples of each healthy and neoplastic tissue type,\none each from different donors. The TMAs were constructed using\na custom-made arrayer described elsewhere [14].\n\n2.2. Malignant tumor samples\n\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded malignant tumor samples\nwere retrieved from the archive: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)\nof the skin, oral cavity, esophagus, and lung; renal cell carcinoma\n(RCC); infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC) of the breast; hepatocellular\ncarcinoma (HCC); and adenocarcinoma of stomach and colon. Eight\nor nine cases of each tumor were retrieved. Whole sections of each\ntissue block were prepared for the immunohistochemistry study.\n\n2.3. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\n\nHuman tissue samples obtained from the Tumor and Serum\nBank of Chimei Medical Center were used to analyze the tran-\nscripts of IL-19 and its receptors, IL-20R1 and IL-20R2. Each type\nof tissue included three samples from different donors. The total\nRNA of the selected tissue was extracted using RNA-Bee isolation\nreagent (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Oligo(dT)21-primed\nfirst-strand cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase.\nWe used PCR to amplify IL-19 and its receptors\u2019 transcripts from\ncDNA. The sense primer (50-gct gcg tga cca aga acc tcc tgg-30)\nand antisense primer (50-tag act ctg gtg gca ttg gt-30) were used\nfor IL-19. The sense primer (50-agc tgg aca gcg aag gaa ta-30) and\nantisense primer (50-agt gtg tga cca acc aca cg-30) were used for\nIL-20R1. The sense primer (50-gaa gtg gcc att ctg cct gcc-30) and\nantisense primer (50-ggg aat ggc ctc tcc ttg cac-30) were used for\nIL-20R2. PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels con-\ntaining ethidium bromide.\n\n2.4. Expressing and purifying IL-19 recombinant protein\n\nA cDNA clone coded for the human IL-19 sequence from leucine\nto leucine (amino acids 25\u2013176) was inserted into the expression\nvector of Pichia pastoris (pPICZ-a; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). We\nused affinity chromatography to express and purify human IL-19\nfrom the culture medium of the yeast cells. This protein was used\nto generate monoclonal antibodies as described below.\n\n\n\nC.-H. Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228 223\n2.5. Generating mouse monoclonal antibodies against human IL-19\n\nMouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against human IL-19\n(1BB1) were generated as previously described [9]. Selecting and\ncharacterizing mAb against human IL-19 followed the standard\nprotocols [18]. We determined the epitope specificity of a panel\nof mAb by testing the ability of pairs of mAb to bind simulta-\nneously to the antigen in ELISA. In brief, the capture antibody\nwas attached to a solid substrate; the antigen (IL-19) was then at-\ntached to the substrate, and the ability of the biotin-labeled detec-\ntion antibody to bind with the antigen was monitored.\n\n2.6. Immunohistochemistry\n\nParaffin-embedded-tissue slides with microarray samples were\nused for immunohistochemical staining with human IL-19 mAb\nand anti-CD68 antibody (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA),\nrespectively. The immunostaining of IL-19 was done as previously\ndescribed [13]. The paraffin on a series of 5-mm sections was re-\nmoved using xylene. The sections were then rehydrated using a\ngraded ethanol series. The sections were immersed in a 10-mM so-\ndium citrate solution at 93 \ufffdC for 20 min to retrieve the antigen;\nnext, the sections were washed with tap water. The slides were\nthen soaked in 90 ml of methanol/10 ml 30% H2O2 for 10\u201315 min\nat room temperature to block endogenous peroxidases, and then\nwashed with PBS. The slides were blocked by immersing them in\nantibody diluent with background-reducing components (DakoCy-\ntomation) for 10 min to suppress non-specific immunoglobulin\nstaining. They were then incubated with purified mAb (diluted\n1:50) against human IL-19 or anti-CD68 antibody (diluted 1:100)\nin blocking reagent at 4 \ufffdC overnight. The pre-absorption test\nwas done before the paraffin tissue sections had been incubated\nwith recombinant IL-19 protein and 1BB1 (ratio, 10:1). Incubating\nparaffin tissue sections with mouse IgG1 isotype (clone 11711;\nR&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) instead of primary antibody was\nthe negative control. The slides were then treated consecutively\nwith HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Biolegend, San Diego,\nCA) (diluted 1:200) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.\nNext, the slides were incubated using an AEC or DAB substrate\nkit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and the color reaction\nwas allowed to develop for 5\u201310 min. After the staining reaction,\nthe slides were washed thoroughly in tap water, counterstained\nwith Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin (ThermoShandon, Pittsburgh, PA), and\nmounted with cover slides.\n\n2.7. Real-time PCR analysis of the IL-19 transcript\n\nTo amplify the IL-19 transcript, real-time PCR was performed\nusing the LightCycler-Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I kit\n(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions. The sense primer (50-gct gcg tga cca aga acc tcc tgg-30) and\nantisense primer (50-tag act ctg gtg gca ttg gt-30) were used in\nreal-time PCR following the standard protocol. Individual PCR\nproducts were analyzed using melting-point analysis. b-Actin\nwas used as an internal control gene to normalize for RNA\namounts. Real-time PCR product was analyzed using the compara-\ntive Ct method according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In\nbrief, sample variation was corrected by subtracting b-actin Ct\nvalues from the Ct values (=DCt) of the IL-19.\n\n2.8. Western blot analysis\n\nFor Western blot analysis, cells (1 \ufffd 106) were plated in 60-mm\ndishes and starved for 24 h before stimulation. The cells were then\nstimulated with human IL-19 (8 nM) for the indicated time. Wes-\ntern blot analysis was done using antibody specific for phosphor-\nAKT (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) or a-tubulin\n(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) following the manufac-\nturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n2.9. Cell proliferation assay\n\nOEC-M1 and OC3 cells, two cell lines derived from SCC of the\noral cavity [19,20] were cultured in growth medium without fetal\ncalf serum for 16 h, and then exposed to various concentrations of\nIL-19 for 48 h. Cells were then incubated with a 1 mg/ml solution\nof 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide\n(MTT) (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3 h. DMSO (dimethyl sulf-\noxide) (Sigma) was added to the culture, and absorbance was\ndetermined to be 550 nm. Fetal bovine serum (10%) (Sigma) was\nused as the positive control. To demonstrate the specific activity\nof human IL-19, monoclonal antibody 1BB1 against human IL-19\nat a concentration of 10:1 (1BB1:IL-19) was added alone or to-\ngether with human IL-19 into cells, and the proliferation of cells\nwas monitored.\n\n2.10. Data analysis\n\nStaining results were read by two pathologists (CLH and SSC)\nblinded to each other\u2019s scoring. The stained TMA slides were visu-\nally scored as strongly stained, moderately stained, weakly stained,\nand not stained. Both pathologists arrived at similar results. Differ-\nences of proliferation between groups of cells were evaluated using\nthe Kruskal\u2013Wallis ANOVA test and then Dunn test. Statistical\nsignificance was set at P < 0.05. Analysis was performed using\ncommercial software (SigmaPlot 9.0; Systat Software Inc., Point\nRichmond, CA).\n3. Results\n\n3.1. IL-19 was expressed in specific tissue types\n\nIL-19 protein was stained in 15 of 28 healthy tissue types\n(Table 1). Selected immunohistochemical micrographs from the\ntissue microarrays immunostained with monoclonal antibodies\nraised against human IL-19 are shown in Fig. 1. The major cell\ntypes stained specifically positive for IL-19 were epithelial cells,\nendothelial cells, and macrophages. Non-specific immunostaining\ndid not occur when the mouse IgG1 isotype was used as the\nnegative control or when a pre-absorption test was done in\nthe immunohistochemical protocol (data not shown). To confirm\nthe expression of IL-19, RNA was extracted and analyzed using\nRT-PCR in nine non-pathological human tissue samples (Fig. 2).\nIL-19 transcripts were expressed in heart, lung, spleen, and pla-\ncenta tissue; these results were consistent with the immunohis-\ntochemical staining.\n\n3.2. Epithelial and myoepithelial cells were stained positive for IL-19\n\nSeveral types of tissue were stained positive for IL-19 in epithe-\nlial cells: skin, lung, liver, kidney, prostate, adrenal gland, and uter-\nine cervix tissue (Table 1). In skin tissue, IL-19 was strongly stained\nin the squamous epithelial cells of the basal epidermis (Fig. 1A) and\nsweat glands. These IL-19-positive squamous epithelial cells were\naccentuated in the stratum basale of skin tissue. In contrast, IL-\n19 was not stained in the squamous epithelial cells of esophagus\ntissue (Fig. 1B) and only weakly stained in uterine cervix tissue (Ta-\nble 1). In lung tissue, alveolar epithelial cells were stained for IL-19\n(Fig. 1C). In liver tissue, IL-19 was moderately stained in hepato-\ncytes (Fig. 1D). In kidney tissue, renal tubular cells were stained\npositive for IL-19 (Fig. 1E). In prostate tissue, glandular epithelial\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Immunohistochemical staining of IL-19 in selected healthy human tissue types on the TMA. IL-19 was strongly stained in squamous epithelial cells (arrow) in skin (A)\nbut not in esophagus tissue (B). In lung tissue, IL-19 was strongly stained in macrophages (arrow) and epithelial cells (arrowhead) (C). In liver tissue, IL-19 was moderately\nstained in hepatocytes (D). In kidney tissue, renal tubular cells (arrow) and capillary endothelial cells (arrowhead) were stained positive for IL-19 (E). In prostate tissue, IL-19\nwas moderately stained in glandular epithelial cells (arrow) and strongly stained in myoepithelial cells (arrowhead) (F). None of the cells in breast (G) or ureter tissue (H)\nwere positively stained for IL-19.\n\n224 C.-H. Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228\ncells and myoepithelial cells surrounding the prostate glands were\nstained positive for IL-19 (Fig. 1F). In adrenal gland tissue, glandu-\nlar epithelial cells were strongly stained for IL-19 (Table 1). The\nglandular epithelial cells of breast tissue (Fig. 1G) were not stained\nfor IL-19. Most epithelial cells in gastrointestinal and urinary tract\ntissue were not stained for IL-19 (Table 1 and Fig. 1H).\n3.3. Endothelial cells were stained positive for IL-19\n\nThe endothelial cells of small vessels in skin, lung, kidney, heart,\nand placenta tissue were stained positive for IL-19 (Table 1). In kid-\nney tissue, anti-IL-19 antibody highlighted most of the capillary\nendothelial cells between the renal tubules (Fig. 1E, arrowhead).\n\n\n\nFig. 2. IL-19 transcripts were expressed in non-pathological tissue. Total RNA\nextracted from non-pathological human tissue and IL-19 transcripts were amplified\nusing RT-PCR. 1: heart, 2: lung, 3: pancreas, 4: spleen, 5: thyroid, 6: skeletal muscle,\n7: stomach, 8: placenta, 9: ureter. b-Actin was an internal control. Similar results\nwere found in tissue samples from three different donors.\n\nC.-H. Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228 225\n3.4. Macrophages were stained positive for IL-19\n\nWe found IL-19 protein in macrophages in lung (Fig. 1C), small\nintestine, colon, rectum, and spleen tissue (Table 1). To colocalize\nIL-19 with CD68 positive cells, we used separate stainings for IL-\n19 and CD68 from neighboring sections on the same tissue slide.\nThese macrophages were stained positive for CD68 (data not\nshown).\nFig. 3. Different types of tumor cells expressed various patterns of IL-19 in neoplastic ti\ncells (arrows) were strongly stained for IL-19. Tumor cells in infiltrating duct carcinoma (I\ncells in hepatocellular carcinoma of the liver (D) and renal cell carcinoma of the kidney (E\ntumor cells (arrow) were not stained for IL-19.\n3.5. Tumor cells in different neoplastic tissue samples were stained\npositive for IL-19\n\nTumor cells in 13 of 15 neoplastic tissue samples were stained\npositive for IL-19 at various levels (Table 2). In tissue from SCC of\nthe tongue (Fig. 3A) and esophagus (Fig. 3B), most tumor cells were\nstrongly stained for IL-19. Infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC) of the\nbreast tumor cells showed strongly positive immunostaining (Fig.\n3C). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Fig. 3D), renal cell carcinoma\n(RCC) (Fig. 3E), and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary tumor cells\nwere moderately stained for IL-19. Transitional cell carcinoma\n(TCC) tumor cells of the bladder, thymic carcinoma, and lymphoma\nwere weakly stained for IL-19 (Table 2). However, most adenocar-\ncinoma (AC) of the stomach and colon (Fig. 3F) tumor cells were\nnot stained for IL-19. To further determine if immunostaining in-\ndeed reflected IL-19 gene expression in the neoplastic tissues, we\nperformed real-time PCR analysis on the neoplastic tissues with\ndifferent levels of immunostaining. SCC of oral cavity and IDC of\nbreast (strongly stained), SCC of lung (moderately stained), TCC\nof bladder (weakly stained), and AC of colon (non-stained) were\nanalyzed for IL-19 transcripts (n = 3 in each tumor).

Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228\ntissues expressed the least levels of IL-19 transcripts than other tu-\nmor tissues. In comparison with AC of colon tissues, the SCC of oral\ncavity, IDC of breast, SCC of lung, and TCC of bladder tissues ex-\npressed higher levels of IL-19 transcripts (5.2-, 4.7-, 5.0-, and 2.8-\nfold, respectively) (Fig. 4).\n\n3.6. A high percentage of carcinoma cells were stained positive for IL-\n19\n\nMany carcinoma tissue samples in the TMA were positively\nstained for IL-19. To determine whether IL-19 was indeed stained\nin the whole section of carcinoma tissue, we stained, with anti-\nIL-19 mAb, archived tissue samples from 34 cases of SCC, 8 cases\nof RCC, 9 cases of IDC, 9 cases of HCC, and 18 cases of adenocarci-\nnoma. A high percentage of SCC, RCC, IDC, and HCC samples, but\nnot adenocarcinoma samples, showed strong-to-moderate positive\nIL-19 immunostaining (Table 3).\n\n3.7. IL-19 activated intracellular signal in oral cancer cell lines\n\nMany SCC tissue samples were strongly stained for IL-19. RT-\nPCR analysis of 3 SCC tumor samples of the oral cavity also showed\nFig. 4. IL-19 transcripts in neoplastic tissues. Transcripts of IL-19 in SCC of oral\ncavity, IDC of breast, SCC of lung, TCC of bladder, and AC of colon were determined\nusing reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR.

We hypothesized that IL-19\nmay act on tumor cells in an autocrine manner. Thus, we chose oral\ncancer cell lines as a model to study the effect of IL-19 on oral can-\ncer cells. OEC-M1 and OC3 cells expressed the mRNA of both IL-19\nand its receptors IL-20R1/IL-20R2 (data not shown). We treated\nOEC-M1 and OC3 cells with IL-19 and analyzed the effect of IL-\n19 on intracellular signaling. After the cells were treated with IL-\n19, the intracellular AKT signal was activated (Fig. 6 A and B), while\nERK and p38 were not significantly activated (data not shown). The\nFig. 6. IL-19 activated intracellular signals in oral cancer cell lines. We analyzed,\nusing Western blotting, the intracellular AKT signal of OEC-M1 (A) and OC3 (B) cells\nafter they were treated with IL-19 (8 nM) at the indicated times. (C) IL-19 (4 and\n8 nM/ml) activated AKT signal in OEC-M1 cells after 30 min treatment, which was\nattenuated by anti-IL-19 monoclonal antibodies (1BB1, 20 nM).

IL-19 induced proliferation of oral cancer cell lines\n\nWe next determined the effect of IL-19 on proliferation of oral\ncancer cell lines. We treated OEC-M1 cells with IL-19 (2, 4, and\n8 nM) for 48 h and determined the cells proliferation using MTT as-\nsay. IL-19 induced proliferation of OEC-M1 cells (Fig. 7A) in a dose-\ndependent manner. In addition, IL-19 (8 nM) also induced prolifer-\nation of OC3 cells (Fig. 7B). These proliferation responses were\nattenuated by anti-IL-19 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 7 A and B).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nKnowledge about the influence of IL-19 on tissue is still incom-\nplete. So far, IL-19 has been found in LPS-treated monocytes, skin\nkeratinocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells [6,21\u201324]. Further\nexploring the expression and distribution of IL-19 in all tissues\nand cell types may help us to investigate the impact of IL-19 in\nthe pathophysiology of human diseases.\n\nIn the present study, using a tissue microarray and immunohis-\ntochemical staining, we presented a survey of the distribution of\nFig. 7. IL-19 induced proliferation of oral cancer cell lines. OEC-M1 (A) and OC3 (B)\ncells were treated with various concentration of IL-19 for 48 h. The proliferation of\nOEC-M1 and OC3 cells were determined by MTT assay (*P < 0.05 versus control).\nAnti-IL-19 monoclonal antibodies (1BB1, 20 nM) was used to specifically neutralize\nthe proliferative activity of IL-19 (#P < 0.05 versus IL-19 (8 nM)). Fetal bovine serum\n(FBS) was used as a positive control. Values are means \u00b1 SEM of triplicate\nexperiments.\nIL-19 protein in 28 types of healthy human tissue and 15 types\nof neoplastic tissue. We found that 15 of 28 types of healthy tissue\nwere stained positive for IL-19. We also verified the TMA results\nwith a semi-quantitative analysis and clarified the IL-19-positive-\nstaining cell types in healthy tissue. The major cell types that\nstained positive for IL-19 were epithelial cells, endothelial cells,\nand macrophages the finding was not previously reported. In addi-\ntion, we also showed that 13 of 15 malignant tumor cells, espe-\ncially SCC, RCC, IDC, and HCC, were stained positive for IL-19.\n\nWe previously reported [25] the tissue distribution of IL-20\nusing TMAs. Both IL-19 and IL-20 were stained in the cell types:\nepithelial cells, myoepithelial cells, endothelial cells, and macro-\nphages. However, they are expressed in different tissue types. Epi-\nthelial cells in liver, kidney, and uterine cervix tissue were\npositively stained for IL-19 but not for IL-20. In contrast, epithelial\ncells in breast, fallopian tube, and ureter tissue were positively\nstained for IL-20 but not for IL-19. Tissue macrophages stained\nfor IL-19 were less widely distributed than those stained for IL-\n20. Skeletal muscle cells were stained positive for IL-20 [25] but\nnot for IL-19, which was consistent with the mRNA expression con-\nfirmed using RT-PCR (Fig. 2).\n\nIL-19 shares a receptor complex with IL-20, indicating that\nsome of the biological activities of these two cytokines might over-\nlap. For example, both IL-19 and IL-20 were strongly stained in skin\nepidermis and induced KGF production in CD8+ T cells, which sug-\ngested that both cytokines might be involved in keratinocyte pro-\nliferation [13,26] and skin diseases. However, the disparate\nexpression of these two cytokines in the tissues suggests they also\nhave dissimilar biological roles.\n\nIt is interesting that most of malignant tumors in this study\nwere positively stained for IL-19. We found that all of SCC of the\nskin, oral cavity, esophagus, and lung were stained positive for\nIL-19, but adenocarcinoma tissue from the gastrointestinal tract\nwas not. Notably, squamous epithelial cells of healthy esophagus\nwere not stained positive for IL-19, while tumor cells of SCC of\nesophagus were strongly stained for IL-19. We also demonstrated\nthat the intensity of IL-19 immunostaining was correlated with\nthe transcript level of IL-19 in SCC of oral cavity, IDC of breast,\nTCC of bladder, and AC of colon. However, tumor cells of SCC of\nlung were moderately stained for IL-19, while their IL-19 transcript\nwas shown to be as high as those of SCC of oral cavity and IDC of\nbreast tissues. The discrepancy may be due to the variation be-\ntween patients or different stages of lung cancer. Further investiga-\ntion will be required to explore if IL-19 expression level correlates\nwith progression of lung cancer. In our previous report [13], immu-\nnostaining of IL-19 on psoriasis tissue showed upregulation of IL-\n19 in psoriasis patients. IL-19 may upregulate KGF production\nand be involved in modulating keratinocyte proliferation and the\npathogenesis of psoriasis [13]. In this study, IL-19 was strongly\nstained in SCC of buccal mucosa, tongue, and esophagus with the\nstaining intensity similar to that of psoriasis (data not shown).\nMoreover, IL-19 induced intracellular AKT phosphorylation and\ncell proliferation in oral cancer cell lines. Thus, IL-19 might play\nan important role in the pathogenesis of SCC.\n\nWe also found that healthy breast tissue was not positively\nstained for IL-19, but breast IDC tissue was strongly stained for\nIL-19. This finding is compatible with a previous report [27] of\nabundant IL-19 mRNA expression in breast-cancer cell lines. Thus,\nthe detailed mechanism how IL-19 is involved in the malignant\ntransformation of epithelial cells requires further investigation.\n\nAmong immune cells, monocytes are the major source of IL-19\n[21]. One study [20] reported that neither resting nor stimulated T\ncell or natural killer (NK) cells expressed IL-19, and another study\n[21] reported that healthy and Epstein Barr virus-transformed hu-\nman B cells expressed IL-19 only in small amounts. In the present\nstudy, we found that B cell lymphoma was stained positive for\n\n\n\n228 C.-H. Hsing et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 221\u2013228\nIL-19, suggesting that IL-19 may be involved in B cell-lineage\nneoplasm.\n\nWe recently [10] confirmed that IL-19 induced apoptosis and\nchemoattractant production in a lung carcinoma cell line, and\nthat it also induced neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro, which indi-\ncated that IL-19 is a chemoattractive factor. The present study\nshowed IL-19 activated intracellular AKT, a signal relating to tu-\nmor cell proliferation, in oral cancer cell lines, which indicated\nthat IL-19 might act in an autocrine manner and be involved\nin tumor growth. We also showed that IL-19 induced prolifera-\ntion of oral cancer cell lines. We therefore hypothesize that IL-\n19 is involved in tumor biology. It will be worthwhile to further\nexplore its molecular mechanism.\n\nMyoepithelial cells in prostate gland tissue stained positive for\nIL-19 is a distinctive finding. IL-19 may be useful as a myoepithelial\nmarker. It also points to a potential clinical use for IL-19 in the\nevaluation of prostate biopsies: the presence or absence of myoep-\nithelial cells may be one of the key elements in distinguishing be-\nnign from malignant glands. Markers such as cytokeratin 34 b-E12\nand p63 are currently used to highlight myoepithelial cells in the\nprostate [28]. It may be worthwhile to examine whether IL-19 adds\nadditional value to the test.\n\nIn summary, this is the first study to use a tissue microarray and\nimmunohistochemical staining to investigate the distribution, by\ntissue type and specific cell type, of IL-19 expression. Epithelial\ncells, endothelial cells, and macrophages were the major cell types\nstained positive for IL-19. We also found several types of tumor\ncells that were positively stained for IL-19, especially SCC cells,\nwhich were widely distributed in several types of tumor tissue.\nWe also showed that IL-19 acted on SCC in an autocrine manner.\nOur data will provide valuable references for further investigation\nof the biological functions and clinical implications of IL-19 in\nhumans.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Mr. Tun-Yi Mou, Department of Physics, National\nCheng Kung University, for building our arrayer.
