Ronald Kahn, June 1, 2013 (sent for review January 26, 2013)\n\nVisceral and s.c. fat exhibit different intrinsic properties, including\nrates of lipolysis, and are associated with differential risk for the\ndevelopment of type 2 diabetes. These effects are in part related to\ncell autonomous differences in gene expression. In the present\nstudy, we show that expression of Shox2 (Short stature homeobox\n2) is higher in s.c. than visceral fat in both rodents and humans and\nthat levels are further increased in humans with visceral obesity.\nFat-specific disruption of Shox2 in male mice results in protection\nfromhigh fat diet-inducedobesity,with a preferential loss of s.c. fat.\nThe reduced adipocyte size is secondary to a twofold increase in the\nexpression of \u03b23 adrenergic receptor (Adrb3) at both the mRNA and\nprotein level and a parallel increase in lipolytic rate. These effects\nare mimicked by knockdown of Shox2 in C3H10T1/2 cells. Con-\nversely, overexpression of Shox2 leads to a repression of Adrb3\nexpression and decrease lipolytic rate. Shox2 does not affect differ-\nentiation but directly interacts with CCAAT/enhancer binding pro-\ntein alpha and attenuates its transcriptional activity of the Adrb3\npromoter. Thus, Shox2 can regulate the expression of Adrb3 and\ncontrol the rate of lipolysis and, in this way, exerts control of the\nphenotypic differences between visceral and s.c. adipocytes.\n\ndevelopmental genes | adipose depots | lipid metabolism\n\nObesity, especially central obesity in which the excessive weightis associated with increased amounts of intraabdominal or\nvisceral fat, is associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes\nand increased risk of cardiovascular disease (1, 2). On the other\nhand, peripheral obesity, characterized by increased amounts of\ns.c. fat, is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and lowered\nrisk of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis, and appears to even\nreduce the risk of diseases associated with central obesity (2, 3).\nConsistent with these findings, we and others have demonstrated\nbeneficial effects of s.c. fat through transplantation studies (4, 5).\nThese clear differences between s.c. and visceral fat suggest\n\nthat, in addition to their anatomical location, these fat depots have\nintrinsic differences at the cellular level. These studies have\ndemonstrated major functional and gene expression differences\nbetween s.c. and visceral fat (6, 7). Both isolated adipocytes and\nthe stromovascular fraction containing preadipocytes show cell\nautonomous differences in the expression of developmental pat-\nterning genes between s.c. and visceral depots, suggesting different\ndevelopmental origins for these fat depots (8).\nOne of the developmental genes that show differential expres-\n\nsion between adipose depots in both mice and humans is Short\nstature homeobox 2 (Shox2). Shox2 mRNA levels are 20-fold\nhigher in the s.c. vs. the visceral adipose depots. This increased\nlevel of Shox2 expression is independent of leptin levels or diet-\ninduced obesity and is found in both isolated adipocytes, as well as\nin preadipocytes sorted from the stromovascular fraction, of s.c. vs.\nvisceral fat (9, 10). Shox2, formerly known as aOg12 (mice), Prx3\n(rats), and SHOT (human), is a homolog to the short stature ho-\nmeobox gene SHOX in humans. Shox2 is the only Shox gene\npresent in mice because mice lack a direct ortholog to human\nSHOX. In mice, ablation of Shox2 causes embryonic lethality at\nmidgestation due to cardiac and vascular defects (11). Studies of\n\nShox2-null and conditional knockout mice have shown an in-\ndispensable role of Shox2 in the formation of the proximal portion\nof the limb skeleton and synovial joints (12, 13). The shortened\nlimbs observed in Turner syndrome may be related to loss of\nSHOX (14, 15).\nDue to the striking differences in expression of Shox2 between\n\nthe s.c. and visceral fat depots, as well as its known roles in regu-\nlating the development of mesodermally derived tissues, we hy-\npothesized that Shox2may have a potential role in the differential\nbiology and function in adipocytes from these different depots. In\nthe current study, we find that SHOX2 expression is higher in the\ns.c. than visceral adipose tissue in mice and humans. SHOX2 ex-\npression in the s.c. fat of people with visceral obesity is increased\ncompared with lean individuals and individuals with s.c. obesity.\nAfter ablation of Shox2 in adipocytes of mice (F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212), the\nresultant male mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and ex-\nhibit decreased adipose mass, especially in the s.c. depot. Adipo-\ncytes isolated from male F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice have an increase in\ncatecholamine-induced lipolysis with a corresponding increase in\n\u03b23-adrenergic receptor (Adrb3) expression. Knockdown and over-\nexpression studies in C3H10T1/2 cell lines demonstrate that\nShox2 is able to repress transcriptional activation of CCAAT/\nenhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u03b1) on the Adrb3 pro-\nmoter in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, Shox2 acts to control\ndifferential adipocyte function and plays an important role in\nthe depot-specific differences in adipocyte behavior.\n\nResults\nShox2 Expression Is Correlated with Visceral Obesity in Humans. We\nhave previously shown that Shox2 is differentially expressed in s.c.\nand intraabdominal fat of mice and humans (8). Shox2 levels are\nhighest in the s.c. fat depots, with only low levels of expression in\nbrown fat or visceral fat depots (9). Likewise, preadipocytes sorted\nfrom the stromovascular fraction of s.c. fat have Shox2 levels that\nare 95-fold higher than those found in visceral fat (10). Quanti-\ntative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of Shox2 mRNA from s.c.\nand perigonadal adipose tissue of obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice\nconfirmed an \u223c20-fold higher level of Shox2 mRNA in s.c. versus\nperigonadal fat in both male and female mice (Fig. 1A; Fig. S1A).\nSimilar differential expression of Shox2 was observed in the adi-\npose depots of obesity-resistant 129/SvEv mice, with no significant\ndifferences between these two mouse strains in Shox2 expression\n(Fig. 1A).\nA similar, but even more striking, differential expression was\n\nobserved in adipose tissue of humans. Thus, qPCR analysis of\nSHOX2 gene expression in 163 nondiabetic Caucasian subjects\n\nAuthor contributions: K.Y.L., Y.Y., and C.R.K. designed research; K.Y.L., Y.Y., J.B., J.N.W.,\nS.G., and M.B. performed research; J.C. and M.B. contributed new reagents/analytic tools;\nK.Y.L. and C.R.K. analyzed data; and K.Y.L. and C.R.K. wrote the paper.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

This differential expression was observed over the\nentire range of BMI from 20 to >50 kg/m2 and in both males and\nfemales (Fig. 1B). Although there was no correlation between\nSHOX2 expression with blood glucose levels, age, or sex, there was\na significant correlation between SHOX2 expression and the site of\nfat deposition in obese individuals. Thus, when the study group\nwas divided into four subgroups\u2014lean [body mass index (BMI) <\n25], overweight (BMI 25\u201330), obese (BMI > 30) with a preferen-\ntial s.c. distribution, and obese with a preferential visceral distri-\nbution\u2014SHOX2 expression in s.c. fat was significantly higher in\nboth obese women and men with a preferential visceral distribu-\ntion compared with lean, overweight, and obese subjects with an\ns.c. distribution (Fig. 1C). Shox2 mRNA levels were not changed\nduring differentiation of either mouse or human preadipocytes\n(Fig. S1 B and C). Thus, in both rodents and in humans, Shox2 is\nexpressed in adipocyte and their precursor cells and is differen-\ntially expressed between fat depots, and, in humans, SHOX2 ex-\npression in the s.c. fat is higher in men and women with visceral\nobesity than those with s.c. obesity or those with no obesity.\n\nAblation of Shox2 Attenuates Diet-Induced Obesity. To investigate\nthe role of Shox2 in adipocyte biology, we created mice with an\nablation of Shox2 in adipocytes using the aP2-cre transgenicmouse\nand mice carrying a Shox2 allele with locus of X-over P1 (loxP)\nsites surrounding the entire coding sequence. Adipocyte protein 2\ncre (aP2-cre); Shox2f/f (termed F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212) mice exhibited effi-\ncient and specific ablation of Shox2 in fat, were born at the ex-\npectedMendelian ratio, and exhibited no overt abnormalities (16).\nF-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 and littermate control Shox2f/f animals were fed\n\na standard chow (21% fat by calories) diet or high fat (60% fat)\ndiet starting at age 6 wk. On a chow diet, there was no difference in\nbody weight in F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 males followed out to 11 mo of age. By\ncontrast, on high fat diet (HFD), F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 males gained weight\nat a significantly slower rate than controls, with a 29% weight re-\nduction in weight gain over the 12 wk (Fig. 2A). This reduction\ncorresponded to a 53%and 30%decrease of the s.c. and perigonadal\n\nfat depots in the F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice as early as 6 wk after exposure\nto HFD (Fig. 2B). As a result, the relative ratio of perigonadal to\ns.c. flank fat after 12 wk of HFDwas 2.45 in male F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212mice\nverses a ratio of only 1.33 in control mice (Fig. 2C). There were no\nobservable changes in triglyceride accumulation in the brown fat\nof F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice after HFD. Likewise, there was no difference\nin adipocyte size in the perigonadal fat between knockout and\ncontrol mice (Fig. 2D). However, adipocyte size in the s.c. fat\nof F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice was markedly reduced, with a 37% decrease\nin median adipocyte diameter, indicating that the decrease in fat\nmass was due to a decrease in cell size, rather than a decrease in\ncell number (Fig. 2E). Thus, F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice are partially pro-\ntected against diet-induced obesity due to a decrease in adipocyte\nhypertrophy, particularly in the s.c. depot.\n\nF-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 Mice Are Not Protected Against Diet-Induced Insulin\nResistance. HFD induces insulin resistance in mice. This insulin\nresistance is reflected by an increase in blood glucose levels and\nlevels of circulating insulin. As expected, control Shox2f/f mice\nshowed a 57% increase in fasting and 42% increase in peak glu-\ncose levels during the glucose tolerance test after 8 wk of HFD\ncompared with chow diet-fed mice. Despite the resistance of male\nF-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice to HFD-induced obesity, these mice showed\na similar 40% increase in fasting blood glucose and a 41% increase\nin peak glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test (Fig. S2A)\ncompared with chow diet-fed mice. Circulating insulin levels were\nsimilarly increased byHFD inmale control (0.36 ng/mL to 1.51 ng/\nmL) and F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 (0.36 ng/mL to 1.73 ng/mL) mice (Fig. S2B).\n\nSubcutaneous\nPerigonadal\n\nFemale Visceral\nFemale Subcutaneous\nMale Visceral\nMale Subcutaneous\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n\nS\nho\n\nx2\n/T\n\nB\nP\n\n***\n***\n\nC57BL/6 129SvEv\n\n20\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\nS\nH\n\nO\nX\n\n2/\n36\n\nB\n4\n\n30 40 50 60\nBMI\n\nLean\nOverweight\nSubcutaneous Obese\nVisceral Obese\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nS\nH\n\nO\nX\n\n2/\n36\n\nB\n4\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nS\nH\n\nO\nX\n\n2/\n36\n\nB\n4\n\nFemales\n*** *****\n\nMales\n*\n\n*\n\nA C\n\nB\n\nFig. 1.

Thus, even though F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice are\nprotected against diet-induced obesity, the reduced body weight\ndid not lead to protection against diet-induced glucose intolerance\nor hyperinsulinemia.\nAlthough F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 and control male mice consumed similar\n\namounts of calories (3.9 \u00b1 0.5 g per mouse per day and 4.3 \u00b1\n0.5 g per mouse per day, respectively) and had comparable levels\nof activity, indirect calorimetry of male mice maintained on\nthe HFD for 2 wk revealed that F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice had an \u223c20%\nincrease in oxygen consumption during both the light period\n(2,431 \u00b1 102 in F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 versus 1,913 \u00b1 171 mL\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7h\u22121,\nP < 0.05) and dark period (2,687\u00b1 133 versus 2,136 \u00b1 240 mL\u00b7kg\nlean\u22121\u00b7h\u22121, P < 0.05) (Fig. 2F). This change in oxygen con-\nsumption occurred with no change in the respiratory quotient,\nan indicator of the relative rates of fat and carbohydrate oxida-\ntion. Together, these data suggest that the protection from diet-\ninduced obesity exhibited by F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212mice was due to increased\nenergy expenditure.\n\nShox2 Ablation Leads to an Increase in Lipolytic Rate. Decreased\nadipocyte size, i.e., reduced triglyceride content, can result from a\ndefect in adipocyte differentiation, decreased lipogenesis, or in-\ncreased lipolysis. qPCR analysis of mRNA isolated from s.c. fat,\nperigonadal fat, and brown adipose tissue from F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 and\nlittermate controls revealed no significant differences in the levels\nof known regulators of adipogenesis, indicating that Shox2 abla-\ntion does not impair adipocyte differentiation. However, after\nexposure to HFD for 2 wk, adipocytes isolated from the s.c. and\nperigonadal depots of F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed an increase in\ncatecholamine-induced lipolytic rate. Thus, when stimulated with\nisoproterenol at concentrations of 0.1 and 1\u03bcM, F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 adi-\npocytes, particularly those from s.c. fat, exhibited a >50% increase\nin glycerol release compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). This\nincrease in lipolytic rate led to a 51% and 30% increase in circu-\nlating free fatty acids (FFA) in F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 on HFD in the fed and\nfasted states compared with controls (Fig. S2D). Despite the in-\ncrease in circulating FFA levels, ectopic fat deposition in the liver\nwas not visibly increased (Fig. S2E), presumably due to protection\nfrom the increased energy expenditure. Although increased li-\npolysis has been shown to increase recruitment of adipose tissue\nmacrophages (17), immunofluorescence on hisotological sections\nfor the macrophage marker F4/80 and quantification of macro-\nphage number showed that macrophage density was not signifi-\ncantly increased in the s.c. fat of F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 males on chow or\nHFD (Fig. S2 F and G). In adipocytes from the perigonadal fat,\nbut not the s.c. fat, of F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice, there was also increased\ninsulin-stimulated lipogenesis (60% at 1 nM and 32% at 10 nM\ninsulin) compensating for the increased lipolysis and helping to\nmaintain adipocyte size (Fig. S3A).\nNumerous proteins, especially adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl)\n\nand hormone sensitive lipase (Hsl), work coordinately to break\ndown and metabolize stored triglycerides. The expression of the\ntwo rate-limiting enzymes of lipolysis, Atgl and Hsl, or the key\ncolipase comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) were not\nsignificantly changed in adipocytes of F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice on HFD\n(Fig. 3B). However, expression of the \u03b23-adrenergic receptors\n(Adrb3) was increased by \u223c50% in F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 adipocytes isolated\nfrom the s.c. fat of mice on HFD (Fig. 3B). Levels of mRNA for\nthe Adrb3 were also increased in F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 perigonadal adi-\npocytes, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.\nThese differences were paralleled by differences in Adrb3 protein\nlevels in s.c. and perigonadal fat of F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212mice on HFD (Fig.\n3C, Fig. S3B). Catecholamines stimulate lipolysis mainly through\nthe phosphorylation and subsequent activation of hormone sen-\nsitive lipase (Hsl) and perilipin (Plin1). Western blot of extracts\nfrom s.c. fat of F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice on HFD showed a significant\n\n1.9-fold increase in phosphorylation of Hsl and a trend for\nincreased Plin1 phosphorylation (1.4-fold; P = 0.18) with no\nchanges in total protein or mRNA levels (Figs. 3D and S3C).\nThus, ablation of Shox2 leads to increased levels of Adrb3,\nwhich results in increased catecholamine-induced lipolysis,\nespecially in s.c. fat cells, leading to smaller adipocyte size in\nF-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice on HFD.\n\nshRNA Knockdown of Shox2 Increases Adrb3 Expression and Lipolysis.\nTo further investigate the mechanisms underlying the increased\nlipolysis found in F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 adipocytes, we used an shRNA len-\ntivirus to stably knockdown endogenous Shox2 expression in adi-\npocytes differentiated from C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells\n(shShox2 cells). qPCR analysis of shShox2 cells showed that Shox2\nmessage was decreased by at least 80% both in the undiffer-\nentiated state and after differentiation into adipocytes using the\nstandard induction protocol with insulin, dexamethasone, and\nisobutylmethylxanthine. shShox2 cells displayed a marked re-\nduction of lipid accumulation upon Oil Red O staining (Fig. S4A).\nqPCR analysis of the major regulators and markers of differenti-\nation, including C/EBP\u03b1, peroxisome proliferator-activated re-\nceptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), and aP2, showed no differences between\nshShox2 cells and control cells over 8 d of differentiation (Fig.\nS4B). Thus, the decreased lipid accumulation in Shox2-deficient\ncells is due to changes in lipid metabolism and not a defect in\ndifferentiation.\nIn control and shShox2 cells, basal and insulin-induced lipogenic\n\nrates measured using [14C] D-glucose incorporation into fatty acids\nshowed no significant differences (Fig. S4C). Lipolysis rate, as\nmeasured by the rate of glycerol release, was also not different\nin the basal condition. However, upon stimulation of lipolysis\nwith 10 nM to 100 nM isoproterenol, shShox2 cells exhibited a\n\nB\n\nA\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nBasal 0.01 0.1 1\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSubcutaneous\n\nIsoproterenol   (\u03bcM)\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nSCF PGF\n\nH\nsl\n\nE\nxp\n\nre\nss\n\nio\nn/\n\nTb\np\n\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n\nSCF PGF\n\nA\ndr\n\nb3\nE\n\nxp\nre\n\nss\nio\n\nn/\nTb\n\np\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nSCF PGF\n\nA\ntg\n\nlE\nxp\n\nre\nss\n\nio\nn/\n\nTb\np\n\n*\n\nAtgl Hsl Adrb3\n\nShox2f/f\nAdrb3\nActin\n\nAdrb3\nActin\n\nF-Shox2-/-\n\nC\n\nShox2f/f F-Shox2-/-\n\nSubcutaneous Fat\n\nPerigonadal Fat\n\nShox2f/f\n\npHSL\n\nActin\n\nHSL\n\nIP: pSerine\n\nF-Shox2-/-D\n\nTotal Plin1\n\nIB: Plin1\nShox2f/f F-Shox2-/-\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nBasal 0.01 0.1 1\n\n*\n\n*\n\nPerigonadal\n\nIsoproterenol  (\u03bcM)\n\nShox2f/f\n\nF-Shox2-/-\n\nLi\npo\n\nly\nsi\n\ns \nR\n\nat\ne \n\n(n\ng\n\ngl\nyc\n\ner\nol\n\n/m\ng \n\nlip\nid\n\n)\n\nLi\npo\n\nly\nsi\n\ns \nR\n\nat\ne \n\n(n\ng\n\ngl\nyc\n\ner\nol\n\n/m\ng \n\nlip\nid\n\n)\n\nFig. 3.

Additionally,\nwhen lipolysis was stimulated by CL-316,243, a specific activator of\nAdrb3, Shox2 knockdown C3H10T1/2 cells demonstrated an in-\ncreased lipolytic rate across a broad concentration range from\n0.1 to 100 \u03bcM (Fig. 4C). In agreement with the in vivo phenotype\nobserved in the F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice, qPCR analysis demonstrated\nthat knockdown of Shox2 in C3H10T1/2 led to a 2.5-fold increase\nin Adrb3 mRNA (Fig. 4D), and this difference was confirmed\nby Western blotting, which showed a dramatic up-regulation of\nAdrb3 protein in knockdown cells (Fig. 4E). Thus, Shox2 does not\naffect differentiation or lipogenesis but leads to an increase in\nAdrb3 expression that, in turn, causes a significant increase in\ncatecholamine-induced lipolysis.\n\nOverexpression of Shox2 Decreases Lipolysis and Adrb3 Expression.\nTo further elucidate the role of Shox2 in adipocytes, we created\nC3H10T1/2 cells with stable overexpression of Shox2 (Fig. 5A).\nThese cells differentiated into adipocytes normally with normal\nlipid accumulation (Fig. S5A) and expression of differentiation\nmarkers. Mirroring the findings of increasedAdrb3 in the F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212\n\nmice and the knockdown cell line, qPCR analysis C3H10T1/2\nadipocytes overexpressing Shox2 exhibited a 58% decrease of\nAdrb3 mRNA expression (Fig. 5B) and a parallel decrease in\nAdrb3 protein (Fig. 5C). This decrease in Adrb3 expression\nlead to an \u223c50% decrease in isoproterenol-stimulated lipolytic\nrate at all concentrations tested, with no change in basal lipolytic\nrate (Fig. 5D). Likewise, althoughmaximal lipolytic rate after 20 \u03bcM\n\nforskolin stimulation was unchanged (Fig. S5B), lipolysis stim-\nulated by the \u03b23-specific agonist, CL-316,243 was decreased by\nabout 50% in Shox2 overexpressing C3H10T1/2 adipocytes\nacross a wide range of concentrations from 0.1 to 1,000 nM\n(Fig. 5E). Taken together with the data from the fat-specific Shox2\nknockout mice and the Shox2 knockdown cell line, these data in-\ndicate that Shox2 is a negative regulator of Adrb3 expression and\nlipolytic rate both in vivo and in vitro.\n\nShox2 Represses C/EBP\u03b1 Transactivation of Adrb3-luc Constructs. The\n\u03b23-adrenergic receptor has been shown to play an important role\nin adipocyte function and metabolic homeostasis (18). The fact\nthat ablation of Shox2 causes increased expression of Adrb3 both\nin vivo and in vitro, and that overexpression led to decreased\nAdrb3 expression, prompted us to test whether Shox2 might di-\nrectly regulate Adrb3 expression. A reporter construct harboring\na 5.13-kb upstream fragment of the mouse Adrb3 gene linked to\na luciferase reporter gene (Adrb3-luc) (19) was cotransfected with\ndifferent concentrations of Shox2 into the C3H10T1/2 cells. Lu-\nciferase assays demonstrated that basal Adrb3 promoter activity in\nC3H10T1/2 cells was very low under these conditions, and no\nchange in activity was seen following Shox2 expression (Fig. 6A).\nHowever, the Adrb3 promoter is potently activated by C/EBP\u03b1\n(20), and, when C/EBP\u03b1 was cotransfected with the reporter\nconstruct, there was a dose-dependent increase in luciferase\nlevels by 2-, 11- and 19-fold at 10 ng, 50 ng, and 200 ng of C/EBP\u03b1,\n\nDays of Differentiation\n\n*\n*\n\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n1.2\n\n1.8\n\n0 2 4 6 8\n\nA\ndr\n\nb3\n/T\n\nbp\nAdrb3\n\nshGFP shShox2\n\nAdrb3\nActin\n\nE\n\nD\n\nshGFP\nshShox2\n\n100\n\nC\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0 0.1 1 10\nCL-316,243 (nM)\n\nCL-316,243\n\n* *\n*\n\n*\n\nLi\npo\n\nly\nsi\n\ns \nR\n\nat\ne \n\n(n\ng\n\ngl\nyc\n\ner\nol\n\n/m\ng \n\nlip\nid\n\n)\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n0 2 4 6 8\n\nS\nho\n\nx2\n/3\n\n6B\n4\n\n* * *\n* *\n\nDays of Differentiation\n\nShox2 B\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n0.12\n\n0 10 100 1000\nIsoproterenol (nM)\n\nLi\npo\n\nly\nsi\n\ns \nR\n\nat\ne \n\n(n\ng \n\ngl\nyc\n\ner\nol\n\n/m\ng \n\nlip\nid\n\n)\n\nIsoproterenol\n* * *\n\nA\n\nFig. 4. shRNA knockdown of Shox2 increases Adrb3 expression and lipoly-\nsis.

Shox2 repressed this induction of Adrb3-luc by\nC/EBP\u03b1 in a dose-dependent manner by up to 75% (Fig. 6A).\nTo determine whether the Shox2 might physically interact with\nC/EBP\u03b1, we transiently transfected C3H10T1/2 cells with vectors\nexpressing C/EBP\u03b1 and a FLAG-tagged-Shox2. We immunopreci-\npitated the cell extracts with anti-FLAG and western blotted the\nprecipitates with anti-C/EBP\u03b1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6B,\nShox2 coimmunoprecipitated with C/EBP\u03b1 in C3H10T1/2 cells.\nThus, Shox2 directly interacts with C/EBP\u03b1 and represses its\nactivation of the Adrb3 promoter.\nTo further assess how Shox2 represses Adrb3 promoter activity,\n\nwe performed ChIP analysis on the endogenous Adrb3 promoter\nafter transiently transfecting C3H10T1/2 cells with vectors ex-\npressing C/EBP\u03b1 and a FLAG-tagged-SHOX2. Interestingly, us-\ning an anti-FLAG antibody, we were unable to show recruitment\nof FLAG-tagged-Shox2, indicating that Shox2 does not bind the\nAdrb3 promoter. However, the expression of Shox2 interferes with\nthe ability of C/EBP\u03b1 to bind the Adrb3 promoter, as C/EBP\u03b1\nrecruitment to the Adrb3 promoter was reduced by about 50%\nwhen cotransfected with Shox2 (Fig. 6C). Thus, the interaction\nwith Shox2 appears to modulate C/EBP\u03b1 activity and leads\nto a decrease in \u03b23-adrenergic receptor expression and decreased\nlipolysis.\n\nDiscussion\nThe differential physiological effects of visceral versus s.c. obesity\nand their relative risk of metabolic disease have been documented\nin multiple studies. Visceral obesity is associated with insulin re-\nsistance and metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, whereas\ns.c. obesity is not (1, 21). In fact, in some studies, s.c. obesity is even\nprotective against the effects of visceral obesity (3). Several factors\nhave been suggested to contribute to these differences: first, an-\natomical differences between visceral and s.c. fat, and especially\nthe fact that visceral fat drains directly into the portal vein, ex-\nposing the liver to higher levels of free fatty acids, adipokines, and\ncytokines, which can lead to insulin resistance (22); second, obesity\nis associated with inflammation and the infiltration of activated\nmacrophages into fat, and these occur to a greater extent in\n\nvisceral fat compared with s.c. fat (23); and finally, a number of\nstudies indicate intrinsic differences in gene expression be-\ntween adipocytes from different fat depots, which might lead to\ndifferent biological and physiological function (6\u20138).\nIn the present study, we have explored how one of these differ-\n\nentially expressed genes, Shox2, may play an important role in\nobesity and body fat distribution. We find that SHOX2 is more\nhighly expressed in s.c. than visceral fat both in mice and humans.\nFurthermore, SHOX2 expression in the s.c. fat is significantly higher\nin both men and women (20% and 40% increased, respectively)\nwith visceral obesity than in individuals with peripheral obesity.\nThus, SHOX2 expression in the s.c. fat is associated with lower\nratios of s.c. to visceral fat, i.e., central obesity, suggesting that\nSHOX2may contribute to a differential distribution and function of\nadipose tissue. Although the modest increase in SHOX2 is unlikely\nto be solely responsible for the visceral obesity in human subjects,\nthese data fit within a growing body of work that shows that nu-\nmerous gene pathways contribute to both common obesity and fat\ndistribution (24).\nWhen F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 male mice are place on HFD, they are re-\n\nsistant to diet-induced obesity and show decreased overall fat\nmass, with greater differences in the s.c. depot. The greater effect\non adipose mass in the s.c. versus the peritoneal fat is consistent\nwith the higher levels of Shox2 in the s.c. fat. This differential\ndistribution of fat is indicated by a change in weight ratio of per-\nigonadal to s.c. fat in male mice made obese by HFD from 1.33 in\ncontrols to 2.45 in F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212mice. Thus, although the F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212\n\nmale mice are protected from HFD-induced obesity, they do this\nby developing a less favorable fat distribution. Even though\nF-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 male mice on HFD are less obese than controls, they\ndo not exhibit the beneficial effects of reduced obesity on meta-\nbolic parameters such as glucose tolerance and insulin levels.\nThese data are consistent with previous studies in rodents and\nhumans (2\u20134, 25) indicating that, in contrast to visceral fat,\nwhich has detrimental metabolic effects, s.c. fat may have a ben-\neficial effect on metabolism.\nThe major contributing factors to this differential effect on\n\nadipose depots appear to be differential changes in lipolytic and\nlipogenic rates. The effect of Shox2 ablation on the growth of the\ns.c. and visceral depots is relative to the levels of Shox2 in these fat\npads. The lipolysis rates of adipocytes from the s.c. and, to a lesser\nextent, perigonadal depots are increased in F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 males\ncompared with controls. In perigonadal adipocytes, this increased\nrate of lipolysis is coupled with increased insulin-stimulated lipo-\ngenesis, and these opposing factors almost balance each other,\nleading to only a modest reduction of perigonadal tissue mass. On\nthe other hand, in s.c. adipocytes, the higher rates of lipolysis are\nnot coupled to higher lipogenic rates, leading to a reduction in\nlipid storage and the reduced adipose cell size observed in the s.c.\nfat. The knockdown of Shox2 in C3H10T1/2 cells also leads to\na decrease of lipid accumulation under basal conditions, suggest-\ning that Shox2 also impacts some other aspect of adipocyte bi-\nology, such as lipid storage. However, themechanism behind these\neffects is unclear, as Shox2 ablation did not change the expression\nof regulators of lipid storage.\nThe increased isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes\n\nisolated from HFD-fed F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 male mice can be explained\nby an increase in \u03b23-adrenergic receptor, especially in the s.c. fat.\nThese data are consistent with previous studies that have shown\nthat, in murine adipose tissue, lipolysis is regulated primarily by\nAdrb3 activation (26) and that inactivation of Adrb3 leads to an\nincrease of fat stores that is accentuated by high fat feeding (18).\nThe phenotype that we observe in F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice is due to an\nincrease in Adrb3, an increase in lipolysis, and a decrease in fat\naccumulation on HFD. These changes are the opposite of those\nobserved in the Adrb3 knockout mice. Other physiological reg-\nulators of Adrb3 have recently been studied. For example, ab-\nlation of SERTA domain containing 2 (TRIP-Br2), similar to\n\nB\n\nInput\n\nIP: Flag\n\nA\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n\nEmpty 10ng 50ng 200ng\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nLi\n\ngh\nt U\n\nni\nts\n\nEmpty Vector\n100ng Shox2\n200ng Shox2\n\n*\n\n*\n\nVector C/EBP\u03b1 C/EBP\u03b1 C/EBP\u03b1\n\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n\nEmpty Shox2\nOnly\n\nC/EBP\nOnly\n\nShox2\nC/EBP\n\nIgG\nanti-C/EBP\n\n*\n\nD\nN\n\nA\n (\n\nIP\n/In\n\npu\nt)\n\n*\n\n**\nC\n\nFig. 6.

However, unlike in-\nactivation of Shox2, TRIP-Br2 also leads to changes in oxidative\ngene metabolism and thermogenesis (27). Although F-Shox2\u2212/\u2212\n\nmice exhibit resistance to diet-induced obesity, unlike TRIP-Br2\nknockout mice, they exhibit higher levels of circulating FFA and\ndo not have improved insulin resistance. Together, these results\nsuggest that, to improve metabolic parameters, free fatty acids\ngenerated through lipolysis must be used in situ by the adipocyte,\nand not released into the circulation.\nNo effect of Shox2 alone was observed on Adrb3 transcription.\n\nHowever, the Adrb3 promoter is directly transactivated by C/EBP\u03b1,\na transcription factor that rises markedly during adipocyte dif-\nferentiation, and Shox2 is able to able to repress this activation\nin a dose-dependent manner by directly interacting with C/EBP\u03b1\nand reducing C/EBP\u03b1 binding to the Adrb3 promoter. Interes-\ntingly, Shox2 deficiency or overexpression does not change the\nexpression of other target genes of C/EBP\u03b1 during adipogenesis,\nsuch as PPAR\u03b3 and aP2. However, recent studies have demon-\nstrated that attenuation of C/EBP signaling reduces Adrb3 action\nwithout changes in other C/EBP\u03b1 target genes (28). Adrb3 may\nact as a sensitive barometer of C/EBP\u03b1 activity because it is not\nfurther activated by PPAR\u03b3 (29).\nIn conclusion, in this study, we demonstrate that Shox2 plays\n\na significant role in determining adipose distribution in both\nhumans and mice. In human subjects, the expression level of\n\nSHOX2 in the s.c. fat is positively correlated with visceral obesity.\nSpecific ablation of Shox2 from mouse adipocytes attenuates diet-\ninduced obesity by reducing adipocyte size, especially in s.c. fat,\nwhere SHOX2 levels are normally high. This decrease in adipo-\ncytes size is secondary to greater rates of lipolysis due to an in-\ncrease in Adrb3 expression. Studies in cell culture models further\ndemonstrate that Shox2 controls lipolytic rate and Adrb3 expres-\nsion in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these data in-\ndicate that Shox2 serves as an important modulator of adipocyte\nfunction, and its differential expression contributes to the depot-\nspecific differences in adipocyte behavior.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nFurther details are presented in SI Materials and Methods. The generation of\nF-Shox2\u2212/\u2212 mice has already been described (16). mRNA and protein ex-\npression was measured by qPCR and western blot, respectively. Lipogenesis\nwas measured by incorporation of [14C] D-glucose into lipids, and lipolytic\nactivity measured by glycerol release. Shox2 was stably overexpressed by\nretroviral transduction, and stably knocked down by lentiviral transduction.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
