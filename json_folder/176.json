Reports have shown that activation of inflammatory cascades play an important\nrole in the development and persistence of neuropathic pain states, but it is not well established in pain-\nful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). Previously, studies have shown increased inflammatory cytokines in the\nserum of the diabetic patients with painful neuropathy. This study focuses on the changes in the levels of\ninflammatory mediators such as TNFa, interleukins, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules with the\ndevelopment of pain in the DRG of the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, an established model for T2D. This\nstudy also demonstrates an alteration in the levels of voltage gated sodium channel 1.7 (NaV1.7) with the\ndevelopment of pain in DRG of the ZDF rats.\nResults: Pre-diabetic ZDF animals at 8\u20139 weeks of age showed no thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia\ncompared to their respective lean controls. Diabetic-ZDF animals tested for pain related behaviors\nshowed significant thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia at 4 and 6 weeks after the onset of diabetes\nwhen compared with their age matched lean controls. These ZDF animals with PDN also showed changes\nin a large number of inflammatory mediators in the DRG as assessed by Western blot as well as by cyto-\nkine antibody array compared to their age matched lean controls. Further analysis by Rat cytokine anti-\nbody array of DRG of the ZDF animals with PDN at 6 weeks after diabetes when compared with ZDF\nanimals with no pain revealed an elevation of a significant number of inflammatory mediators including,\nthe pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa, interleukin-1, 6, 13 and 17, chemokines such as MIP1 and\n3, RANTES, Fractalkine and cell adhesion molecule sICAM that are associated with pain phenotype. The\nZDF animals with PDN also demonstrated an increase in the protein levels of voltage gated sodium chan-\nnel NaV1.7 in DRG compared to lean controls with no pain.\nConclusions: The rise in inflammatory markers in the DRG of Type 2 diabetic animals and increases in\nvoltage gated sodium channel NaV1.7 in DRG with the onset of pain in PDN suggest that inflammation\nin the DRG may play an important role in the development of pain in this model.\n\nPublished by Elsevier Ltd.\n\nRA\nCT\n\nE\n\n1. Introduction\n\nDiabetes mellitus is the most common cause of neuropathy in\nthe United States and pain is a significant complication of diabetic\nneuropathy occurring in 20\u201325% of patients with neuropathy and\nresulting in a significant adverse effect on quality of life measures\n\nR\n [1]. Unfortunately, available medical treatment is relativelyineffective with limited efficacy and often complicated by side ef-fects and dependency [2,3]. The etiology of pain in diabetic neurop-athy is not well understood. Accumulating evidence suggests thatthe activation of inflammatory cascades in the peripheral and cen-\ntral nervous system may play a role in the development and persis-\ntence of neuropathic pain states induced by physical or toxic injury\nto peripheral nerve [4,5].\n\nIn diabetes there is evidence of systemic immune activation. Pa-\ntients with painful neuropathy have increased IL-2 and TNFa\nmRNA and protein levels in blood [4]. Type 1 diabetes patients\nhave increased serum TNFa [6] and studies on patients with\ndiabetic painful neuropathy exhibit a different serum immune\nprofile compared to patients with painless diabetic neuropathy,\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.009&domain=pdf\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.009\nmailto:munmunc@umich.edu\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.009\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine\n\n\n2 C. Galloway, M. Chattopadhyay / Cytokine 63 (2013) 1\u20135\nsuggesting that immune markers in blood are associated with dia-\nbetic neuropathic pain [7]. But, the relationship of these serum\ninflammatory markers to nociceptive pathways in the nervous sys-\ntem has not been explored. We undertook these studies to evaluate\nthe role of inflammatory mediators in DRG in T2D model of PDN.\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Study design and behavioral test\n\nThe Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF, Charles River, USA) rat, a sub-\nstrain of the obese Zucker rat, is an established model for Type 2\ndiabetes in which hyperglycemia initially manifests at about 8\u2013\n9 weeks of age. A blinded researcher assessed thermal hyperalgesia\nby measuring the latency to hind paw withdrawal from a thermal\nstimulus determined by exposing the plantar surface of the hind\npaw to radiant heat using a modified Hargreaves thermal testing\ndevice. Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed using an analgesim-\neter (Ugo-Basile, Comerio, VA, Italy) by the Randall and Selitto paw\npressure method as described previously [8].\nA\n\n2.2. Cytokine array and Western blot\n\nRat Cytokine Array (ARY008; R&D Systems, USA) was used to\nsimultaneously detect the relative expression of 29 cytokines, che-\nmokines and cell adhesion molecules. This antibody array detects\nmultiple analytes in tissue lysates. L4\u2013L6 DRG from rats (n = 5)\nwere homogenized and prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. The sample protein concentrations were measured\nusing a total protein assay [8]. Once the membranes were blocked,\n15 lL of reconstituted detection antibody cocktail were added to\neach prepared sample. The samples with antibody cocktail were\nthen added to the membrane and incubated at room temperature\nfor 1 h. The membranes were washed, followed by incubation with\nStreptavidin-HRP for 30 min. The intensity of each spot was deter-\nmined by quantitative chemiluminescence, using a PC-based im-\nage analysis system (ChemiDoc XRS System, Bio-Rad\nLaboratories, USA); and pixel densities were quantitated by analyz-\ning the array image file using image analysis software (Quanti-one\n4.6.1; Bio-rad Laboratories, USA). For western blot, L4\u2013L6 DRG\nfrom each animal considered as one sample (n = 5) were homoge-\nnized and prepared as described previously [8].\n\nR\n\n2.3. DRG culture experiment\n\nFor in vitro studies, adult rats were anaesthetized with chloral\nhydrate (400 mg/kg i.p.). DRG from these rats were collected and\ndissociated following 0.25% collagenase treatment for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC\nwith 0.25% trypsin, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)\nfor 30 min at 37 \ufffdC with constant shaking and then plated on Lam-\ninin, poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips at 105 cells per well in a 24-\nwell plate in 500 ll of defined neurobasal media containing B27,\nGlutamax I, Albumax II and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco-BRL,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 100 ng/ml of 7.0S NGF\nper ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). 4 day old DRG neurons in cul-\nture were incubated with 15 ng/ml of recombinant TNFa (rTNFa,\nSigma) for overnight and collected for qRT-PCR and western blot\nanalysis for NaV1.7 level in DRG (Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\nRE\nT\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\n\nThe statistical significance of the difference between groups\nwas determined by ANOVA (Systat 11) using Bonferroni\u2019s\ncorrection for the multiple post hoc analyses. All results are ex-\npressed as mean \u00b1 SEM.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. ZDF rats with Type 2 model of diabetes showed thermal\nhyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia 6 weeks after diabetes\n\nPre-diabetic animals at 8\u20139 weeks of age showed normal re-\nsponses similar to their age-matched lean controls (Fig. 1a). At\n2 weeks after diabetes, ZDF animals showed only significant de-\ncrease in thermal latency (Fig. 1b; lean 14.93 \u00b1 2.2 s; ZDF\n10.67 \u00b1 1.8 s; P < 0.01) but no significant difference in mechanical\nhyperalgesia compared to the lean controls. At 4 weeks (lean\n13.16 \u00b1 0.6 s; ZDF 10.18 \u00b1 0.9 s; P < 0.005 at 6 weeks) and 6 weeks\nafter the onset of diabetes, the ZDF animals showed significant de-\ncrease in thermal latency (lean 12.93 \u00b1 1.2 s; ZDF 8.47 \u00b1 1.7 s;\nP < 0.005 at 6 weeks) and substantial decrease in paw withdrawal\nthreshold measured by Randall-Selitto method at 4 weeks (lean\n78.5 \u00b1 1.9 gm; ZDF 54.50 \u00b1 2.5 gm; P < 0.005) and 6 weeks (lean\n89.64 \u00b1 8.2 gm; ZDF 59.53 \u00b1 5.7 gm; P < 0.005; Fig. 1c and d) after\nthe onset of diabetes.\n\n3.2. ZDF animals with pain-related behavior exhibited increased\nNaV1.7 in DRG\n\nIn previous studies we and others have found that there is an\nincrease in the amount of voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7\n(NaV1.7) in DRG of STZ-diabetic (a model of T1D) animals with\nPDN [8]. In this study, DRG were analyzed for expression of voltage\ngated sodium channel isoform NaV1.7 by Western blot to correlate\nthe changes in NaV1.7 with the changes in pain-related behaviors.\nWe did not find any increase in the level of NaV1.7 in 8 weeks old\npre-diabetic ZDF animals without PDN (Fig. 1a and e). 2 weeks\nafter diabetes, ZDF animals showed significant increase in thermal\nhyperalgesia (P<0.01) but not mechanical hyperalgesia and a mod-\nerate increase in NaV1.7 (Fig. 1b and f). At 4 and 6 weeks after dia-\nbetes, ZDF animals showed significant thermal and mechanical\nhyperalgesia along with a substantial increase in NaV1.7 levels in\nDRG (Fig. 1c, d and g, h).\n\n3.3. ZDF rats with painful diabetic neuropathy demonstrated increased\nneuroinflammation in DRG\n\nPre-diabetic ZDF animals showed no significant change in the\nexpression of any of the 29 pro-inflammatory cytokines or chemo-\nkines in DRG at 8 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 2) compared to\ntheir age-matched lean controls. ZDF animals with PDN 6 weeks\nafter diabetes when compared with their respective age-matched\nlean control animals showed a significant increase in 27 out of\n29 cytokine/chemokines/cell adhesion molecules; only 2 cytokines,\nIL-10 and IL-4, those have anti-inflammatory properties, did not\nchange in these animals (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nBy Western blot of DRG, we found that ZDF animals at 6 weeks\nof diabetes exhibited significant increases in a number of inflam-\nmatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), inter-\nleukin-1 b (IL1b) and phospho-p38 MAPK protein compared to\nlean control animals (Fig. 2a\u2013c). ZDF animals with PDN at 6 weeks\nof diabetes when compared with pre-diabetic ZDF animals without\nPDN showed significant increases in 19 inflammatory mediators\n(Fig. 2d), including the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa,\ninterleukin (IL)-1a and b, IL-6, IL-13 and IL-17, chemokines such\nas MIP1 and 3, RANTES, Fractalkine and cell adhesion molecule sI-\nCAM in DRG of ZDF with PDN.\n\nCT\nED\n\n\n\nMechanical Hyperalgesia Thermal Hyperalgesia\n(a)\n\nLean ZDF\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\ngm\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nse\nc\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\ngm\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\ngm\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n\u2217\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\ngm\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nLean ZDF\n\n\u03b2 actin\nNav1.7\n\n(e)\n\nPre-diabetic\n\nLean ZDF\n\n\u03b2 actin\n\nNav1.7\n\n(f)\n\n2 weeks of diabetes\n\nLean ZDF\n\n\u03b2 actin\nNav1.7\n\n(g)\n\n4 weeks of diabetes\n\nLean ZDF\n\n\u03b2 actin\nNav1.7\n\n(h)\n\n6 weeks of diabetes\n\nSodim channel Nav1.7\n\nse\nc\n\nse\nc\n\nse\nc\n\nLean ZDF\n\nLean ZDF Lean ZDF\n\nLean ZDF Lean ZDF\n\nLean ZDF Lean ZDF\n\nFig. 1.

(e) Pre-diabetic ZDF animals at 8 weeks of age with no pain, show no change in NaV1.7\nlevels by Western blot analysis.

Discussion\n\nInflammation plays a central role in the nervous system in re-\nsponse to injury which affects vasodilatation, increased vascular\npermeability, cell migration, and pain.

(d) ZDF animals with painful neuropathy at\n6 weeks after the onset of diabetes have shown an increase in a significant number of inflammatory markers in the DRG including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa,\ninterleukin-1, 6, 13 and 17, chemokines such as MIP1 and 3, RANTES, Fractalkine and cell adhesion molecule sICAM by rat cytokine antibody array compared to pre-diabetic\nZDF animals without any pain phenotype (n = 5).\n\n4 C. Galloway, M. Chattopadhyay / Cytokine 63 (2013) 1\u20135\n\nAC\nTE\n\nD\n\ncytokines elevated in the DRG of ZDF animals with PDN at 6 weeks\ncompared to pre-diabetic ZDF without PDN in this study are TNFa\nand interleukins, particularly IL1a, IL1b, IL-6, IL13 and IL17. These\ncytokines have also been implicated in the development of hyper-\nsensitivity or pain in other models of neuropathic pain caused by\nphysical injury which are important for the regulation of immune\nresponses and nociception [5]. Members of the CC and CXC family\nof chemokines that are significantly increased compared to pre-\ndiabetic ZDF animals without pain include CCL3 (MIP-1a) and\nCCL20 (MIP-3a) [9], CCL5 and CXCL10 (RANTES and IP-10) [10],\nCXCL7 (thymus cytokine) and CX3CL1 (Fractalkine), which are\nincreased in other models of neuropathic pain resulting from phys-\nical injury to nerve and are implicated in behavioral hypersensitiv-\nity and vascular inflammation [11]. Cell adhesion molecule\nsICAM-1 that represents important biomarker for inflammatory\nprocesses [7] was also increased in ZDF animals with PDN. In\nrecent past trophic factors have been implicated with pain in pa-\ntients. Trophic factors, including ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)\nwhich has been associated with hyperalgesia in ALS patients in a\nphase I trial, and increased levels of vascular endothelial growth\nfactor (VEGF) which was linked with severity of pain in patients\nwith bladder pain [12,13], were also elevated in ZDF animals with\nPDN in this study.\n\nTo date, research focused on improving the treatment of chronic\npain has largely ignored the role of inflammation-associated fac-\ntors in nociceptive pathways in the peripheral nervous system in\ndiabetic subjects. In these studies, we found that a number of cyto-\nkines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules are altered in T2D\nanimals with PDN. Similar to our previous STZ-diabetic studies,\nthese studies also documented that ZDF animals with pain demon-\nstrate increased NaV1.7 levels in DRG. In recent studies it has been\nshown that elevated levels of TNF-a are responsible for the up-reg-\nulation of voltage gated sodium channel activity [14]. We found\n\nRE\nTR\nthat the adult DRG neurons in culture when pre-incubated with\n15 ng/ml of recombinant TNFa (rTNFa) for overnight, to determine\nwhether the increase in proinflammatory cytokines would change\nthe level of NaV1.7 in the neurons, showed an increase in NaV1.7\nprotein and mRNA levels compared to control cells. This prelimin-\nary study suggests that TNFa plays an essential role in modulation\nof voltage gated sodium channel (Supplementary Fig. 3). We have\nshown that ZDF animals with PDN starting at 2 weeks had a small\nincrease in the levels of NaV1.7 compared to no change in the pre-\ndiabetic ZDF animals without any pain. At 4 and 6 weeks after the\nonset of diabetes, DRG of the animals had significant increase in\nthe levels of NaV1.7. These animals at 6 weeks of diabetes also\nshowed an increased phosphorylation of p-38 in DRG along with\nsimultaneous changes in a number of proinflammatory cytokines\nand chemokines as stated above. Hence, the results from this study\nmay suggest that the elevation of these inflammatory mediators in\nDRG may be responsible for the development of painful neuropa-\nthy in Type 2 diabetes, which may be associated with increases\nin the voltage gated sodium channel NaV1.7. Therefore, the painful\ndiabetic neuropathy may possibly be considered, at least in part, a\n\u2018neuro-inflammatory\u2019 condition. Taken together, a better under-\nstanding of the role of these pro-nociceptive markers may lead to\nthe development of novel analgesic targets.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work has funded by Pilot and Feasibility Grant from the\nMichigan Diabetes Research and Training Center (Award Number\nR000617 to MC, from the NIDDK Grant 5P60-DK020572) and\nAmerican Diabetes Association (Grant #7-12-BS-021).
