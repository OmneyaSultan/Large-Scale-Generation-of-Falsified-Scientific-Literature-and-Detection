RT-PCR andWestern blot analysis were used to determine the effects of CH on the expression ofMDR1\nmRNA and P-glycoprotein in K562/ADR cells when CH was used alone and combined with SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, to explore\nthe effects of CH on JNK pathway. Western blot analysis was used to determine the effects of CH on c-Jun protein expression\nand phosphorylation, to explore the regulating effects of CH on c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun) proteins. Our results\nshowed that the inhibitory effect of CH on MDR1 mRNA increased with the concentrations of CH (5.0, 10.0, and 20.0\ud835\udf07M) and\nthe inhibitory effects of CH on MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein increased with the incubation time of CH (0, 12, 24, 36, and\n48 hours). The inhibitory effect was weakened after CH combined with SP600125. The expressions of c-Jun and p-c-Jun proteins\nincreased with the incubation time of CH (0, 6, 12, and 24 hours).These findings suggest that CH downregulated the expressions of\nMDR1mRNA and P-glycoprotein in a time and concentration manner; the mechanism may be mediated via activating c-Jun/JNK\npathway.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nChemotherapy is one of the main treatment strategies for\ncancer patients currently. However, it is more and more\nserious that the multidrug resistance (MDR) occurred in the\ncancer patients as the anticancer drugs arewidely used, which\naffected the patients\u2019 treatment directly. The overexpression\nof P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by multidrug resistance\ngeneMDR1, is one of the important mechanisms involved in\nMDR [1\u20133]. For that reason, it is a problem that should be\nsolved quickly to search for MDR reversor and improve the\nchemotherapy sensitivity for medicine academia currently.\n\nNatural source compounds have become the new trend\nof discovering the fourth-generation P-gp inhibitors because\n\nthey are less toxic and more potent than the disappointing\npreviousMDRmodulators [4\u20136]. Cepharanthine hydrochlo-\nride (Figure 1), manufactured by salification from cepharan-\nthine (CEP), which is a biscoclaurine alkaloid, extracted from\nStephania cepharantha Hayata, has a reversed effect involved\nin multimechanisms from our previous studies [7\u20139]. In\nrecent years, it is reported that CH has MDR-reversing effect\nand one of the reversing mechanisms is to inhibit the P-gp\nexpression and function in MDR cancer cells [10, 11].\n\nMitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family has a\nvital role to play in regulating gene expression. c-Jun NH\n\n2\n-\n\nterminal kinase (JNK) is one of the members of MAPK\nfamily. Growing evidence suggests that JNK is closely related\nto the occurrence ofMDR [12\u201314].The signals relayed by JNK\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nBioMed Research International\nVolume 2014, Article ID 164391, 6 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/164391\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/164391\n\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\nN\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\nN\n\nOO\n\n\u00b7 2HCl\n\nFigure 1: The chemical structure of CH used in the present study.\n\nthrough c-Jun regulate a range of cellular processes including\ncell proliferation, tumorigenesis, apoptosis, and embryonic\ndevelopment. MDR1 gene is also regulated through c-Jun\nin transcriptional level [15, 16]. Therefore, a new possible\ntherapeutic target of reversing MDR and improving the\neffectiveness of chemotherapy is to regulate JNK pathway.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, it remains unclear whether\nJNK associates with the regulation and expression of P-\ngp by CH on reversing MDR. The purpose of the study\nis to determine the signal transduction mechanism of CH\non reversing MDR in the human chronic myeloid leukemia\nAdriamycin-tolerance K562/ADR cell line.\n\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Reagents. CH was provided by Henan Academy of\nMedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences (Zhengzhou, Henan,\nChina). SP600125 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.\nLouis,MO,USA). RPMI-1640 was purchased fromLife Tech-\nnologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). Anti-P-gp, c-Jun, p-c-Jun,\nand anti-\ud835\udefd-actin primary and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-\nconjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa\nCruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). ECL detection\nkit was purchased from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology\n(Jiangsu, China).\n\n2.2. Cell Lines and Cell Culture. K562 cells and K562/ADR\ncells were purchased from Shanghai Institutes for Biological\nSciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).\nThe two cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 culture\nmedium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37\u2218C in a\nhumidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n\n2\n. When the cells reached\n\nconfluency, they were harvested and plated for either subse-\nquent passages or drug treatments.The trypan blue exclusion\ntest was used throughout the experiments to check cell\nviability.\n\n2.3. Cell Growth Inhibition Assay. Chemosensitivity in vitro\nwas measured by MTT assay. Briefly, the cells were harvested\nin exponential growth and seeded into 96 well plates at a\ndensity of 2.0 \u00d7 104 cells per well in a final volume of 180 \ud835\udf07L\nwith or without 5 \ud835\udf07Mof CH or VER. After a 48 h incubation,\n20\ud835\udf07L of MTT was added to each well and further incubated\n\nfor 4 h. The resulting formazan was dissolved with 200\ud835\udf07L of\ndimethyl sulfoxide after aspiration of the culture medium.\nThe plates were shaken for 5min with a plate shaker and the\nabsorbance was measured at 570 nm using a Bio-Rad ELISA\nplate reader (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The fractional absorbance\nwas calculated by the following formula: % cell survival =\n(mean absorbance in test well)/(mean absorbance in control\nwells) \u00d7 100%. IC\n\n50\nwas calculated from the cytotoxicity\n\ncurves. The degree of resistance was calculated by dividing\nthe IC\n\n50\nfor the MDR cells by that for the parental sensitive\n\ncells. The reversal fold of MDR was calculated by dividing\nthe IC\n\n50\nfor cells to the anticancer drug in the absence of the\n\nmodulator by that in the presence of the modulator.\n\n2.4. RT-PCR Analysis. To study the effects of CH on MDR1\nmRNA expression, the K562/ADR cells at a density of 1 \u00d7\n105/mL in exponential growth were exposed to 5.0, 10.0, and\n20.0\ud835\udf07M of CH for 48 h or were exposed to 10.0 \ud835\udf07M of CH\nfor 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. For the investigation of the effects of\nCH on JNK signal transduction pathway in mRNA level, the\nK562/ADR cells were treatedwith 10.0\ud835\udf07MofCHor 2.0\ud835\udf07Mof\nSP600125 along or CH plus SP600125 for 48 h.The total RNA\nisolationwas performedwith TRIZOL (Invitrogen, USA). All\nRNA preparation and handling steps took place in a laminar\nflow hood, under RNAse-free conditions. The isolated RNA\nfrom each fraction was dissolved in 20\ud835\udf07L of RNAse-free\nwater and stored at \u221280\u2218C until used. cDNA synthesis was\nperformed at 37\u2218C for 15min and 85\u2218C for 5 sec using\nthe Primer Script RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology,\nDalian, China) in a total volume of 20\ud835\udf07L according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. The primers sequences used for\namplification of MDR1 and GAPDH were shown in Table 1.\nThe PCR cycling conditions comprised a denaturation step\nfor 5min at 95\u2218C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation\n(94\u2218C for 15 s), annealing (58\u2218C for MDR1 and 57\u2218C for\nGAPDH for 30 s), and extension (72\u2218C for 30 s). After the last\ncycle, all PCR products were subjected to a final extension\nfor 5min at 72\u2218C. PCR products were combined and then\nelectrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium\nbromide. Autoradiographic films of the RT-PCR assays were\nsubjected to densitometric analyses using a KODAK Gel\nLogic 100 Image Station (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY,\nUSA).\n\n2.5. Western Blot Analysis. To study the effects of CH on\nc-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun) expression, the\nK562/ADR cells were treated with 10.0\ud835\udf07M of CH for 6,\n12, and 24 h. For the investigation of the effects of CH\non JNK signal transduction pathway in protein level, pro-\ntein extracts for gel-electrophoresis were made from the\ncells treated as above according to standard techniques.\nBriefly, proteins were solubilized and then fractionated by\nsodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n(SDS-PAGE). Western blotting analysis was performed by\na slight modification of the method described previously\n[17]. Polyvinylidene fluoridemembraneswere incubatedwith\nprimary antibodies (diluted 1 : 1,000): Pgp, p-c-Jun, c-Jun, and\n\ud835\udefd-actin. The membranes were washed and incubated with\nHRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted 1 : 2,000) for\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 3\n\nTable 1: Primers and annealing temperatures forMDR1 and GAPDH.\n\nForward Reverse Annealing\ntemperatures\n\nPredicted\nsize in bp\n\nMDR1 5\udba0\udc20-CTG CTT GAT GGC AAA GAA ATA AAG-3\udba0\udc20 5\udba0\udc20-GGC TGT TGT CTC CAT AGG CAA T-3\udba0\udc20 58\u2218C 130\nGAPDH GAG TCA ACG GAT TTG GTC GT GAC AAG CTT CCC GTT CTC AG 57\u2218C 196\n\n1 h. The proteins were then detected using the ECL detection\nkit.\n\n2.6. Statistical Analysis. Data are the means \u00b1 SD from\ntriplicate samples of at least three independent experiments.\nDifferences between the mean values were analyzed by two-\nsample Student\u2019s \ud835\udc61-test and one-way analysis of variance; the\nresults were considered statistically significant when \ud835\udc43 <\n0.05.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effect of CH on Reversing MDR In Vitro. The K562/ADR\ncells were approximately 31-fold resistant to ADR in com-\nparison with the K562 cells. In drug-resistant K562/ADR\ncells, coincubation of CH with ADR resulted in a significant\nincrease in the cytotoxicity of ADR; the IC\n\n50\ndropped drasti-\n\ncally from 13.97\u00b10.30 to 1.62\u00b10.10 \ud835\udf07M.While coincubation\nof the same concentration of VER resulted in a slight increase\nin the cytotoxicity of ADR, the IC\n\n50\nshifted to 6.07\u00b10.18 \ud835\udf07M.\n\nHowever, this effect of CH or VER was not observed in\nparental K562 cells (Table 2).\n\n3.2. Downregulation of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp by CH. RT-\nPCRanalysis showed that the level ofMDR1mRNAdecreased\nsignificantly after treatment with 10.0 \ud835\udf07Mof CH (Figure 2(a))\nand the level of MDR1 mRNA partially decreased by 5.0 \ud835\udf07M\nofCHand completely by 20.0 \ud835\udf07MofCH in 48 h (Figure 2(b)),\nsuggesting the downregulation of MDR1 mRNA by CH in a\ntime- and concentration-dependency. Western blot analysis\nshowed that the level of P-gp decreased progressively from\n24 to 48 h in a time-dependent manner after treatment with\n10 \ud835\udf07M of CH (Figure 2(c)).\n\nJNK activity is required for the downregulatory effect by\nCH onMDR1mRNA and P-gp.\n\nWe then examined whether the downregulation of P-\nglycoprotein by CH required JNK activity. After the cells were\ntreated with 10.0 \ud835\udf07M of CH plus the JNK inhibitor SP600125\n(2.0 \ud835\udf07M) for 48 h, the levels of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp\nincreased comparedwith that in the cells treatedwith 10.0\ud835\udf07M\nofCHalone usingRT-PCRandWestern blot analysis (Figures\n3 and 4), suggesting that SP600125 inhibited CH-induced\ndownregulation of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression in\nterms of both mRNA and protein level.\n\n3.3. CH Induces Activation of JNK in K562/ADR Cells. We\nsought to further confirm the above-mentioned findings by\nanalyzing the transcription factor c-Jun and the substrate for\nJNK using Western blot. After treatment of the K562/ADR\n\ncells with 10.0 \ud835\udf07M of CH, c-Jun and phosphorylation-c-Jun\n(p-c-Jun) protein levels began to rise from 6 h (Figure 5),\nsuggesting that CH increased both phosphorylation and\nexpression of c-Jun in a time-dependent manner.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nMDR is complex biological processes that involve many\nMDR transporter proteins, genes, and signal transduction.\nAlthough researches have advanced greatly in MDR, it\nremains a formidable problem in clinical treatment. Statistics\nshow that cancer deaths are on the rise all around the\nworld and there will be more than over 11 million cancer\ndeaths by 2020 [18]. More than 90% of all cancer deaths\nare considered to be associated with MDR [19]. A lot of\nresearches currently are just focusing on a certain kind of\nresistance mechanisms designed to block the MDR, which\nmay not be completely reversed. On the contrary, a research\naccording to the different mechanisms simultaneously may\nbe more effective to reverse the MDR.\n\nIn recent years, CH or CEP has been reported to induce\napoptosis of human leukemia cell line and hematoma cell\nline [20], decrease the activation of GST-\ud835\udf0b and NF-\ud835\udf05B, and\nincrease the activation of DNA Topo II to reverse MDR,\nsuggesting that the reversing effect of CH involves multi-\nmechanisms. In recent years, the relationship between signal\ntransduction pathway and MDR is becoming a hot research\narea gradually. Recent evidence indicates that pumping out\nxenosubstance is an important defense mechanism of the\ncell responding to stressful stimuli, while the regulation of\nMDR1 expression often involves stress reaction and signal\ntransduction [21], for example, JNK and NF-\ud835\udf05B. JNK is\na stress-activated protein kinase that can be induced by\ninflammatory cytokines, bacterial endotoxin, osmotic shock,\nUV radiation, and so on. It has been reported that NF-\ud835\udf05B\nand JNK are functionally interconnected; activation of NF-\n\ud835\udf05B inhibits the activation of JNK and vice versa [22]. Our\nprevious study has demonstrated thatCHhasweak antitumor\neffect [23]; other researchers reported that the effect was\nrelated to inhibiting the activation of NF-\ud835\udf05B [24]. In the\nmeanwhile, the NF-\ud835\udf05B inhibition effect is one of the MDR\nreversing mechanisms of CH [11]. In view of this, we further\ninvestigated whether CH plays its P-gp inhibition effect is\nrelated to regulating the JNK pathway.\n\nSP600125, a reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor, specif-\nically inhibits activation of the JNK in response to a variety\nof stress stimuli [25, 26]. In order to determine whether acti-\nvation of JNK is directly associated with the P-gp expression\nin K562/ADR cells, we sought to block JNK activity using\n\n\n\n4 BioMed Research International\n\nTable 2: Cytotoxicity of ADR alone and in combination with VER or CH in K562 and K562/ADR cells in vitro.\n\nDrug and concentration IC50 (\ud835\udf07M) Resistance times Reversing times\nK562 K562/ADR\n\nADR 0.45 \u00b1 0.11 13.97 \u00b1 0.30\u2217 31.04\nADR + CH (5\ud835\udf07M) 0.44 \u00b1 0.12 1.62 \u00b1 0.10\u2217\u25b3 3.68 8.43\nADR + VER (5\ud835\udf07M) 0.46 \u00b1 0.07 6.07 \u00b1 0.18\u2217\u25b3f 13.19 2.35\nCells were exposed to various concentrations of ADR, with or without 5 \ud835\udf07MCH, or VER for 48 h. \u2217\ud835\udc43 < 0.05 compared with K562 treated with ADR, or ADR\ncotreated with CH or VER, \u25b3\ud835\udc43 < 0.05 compared with K562/ADR treated with ADR, f\ud835\udc43 < 0.05 compared with K562/ADR treated with ADR plus CH.\n\nMDR1\n\nGAPDH\n\nK562/ADR\n\n0 12 24 36 48 (h)CH (10\ud835\udf07M)\n\n(a) RT-PCR\n\nMDR1\n\nGAPDH\n\n0 5 10 20 (\ud835\udf07M)CH (48h)\n\n(b) RT-PCR\n\nP-gp\n\n\ud835\udefd-Actin\n\n0 12 24 36 48 (h)CH (10\ud835\udf07M)\n\n(c) Western blot\n\nFigure 2: Effects of CH on MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression in K562/ADR cells.

CH-induced downregulation of\nMDR1mRNA expression was abolished partly when combined with\nSP600125 (2.0 \ud835\udf07M).\n\nSP600125 and to determine the effect on the extent of inhibit-\ning P-gp expression induced by CH. Our results showed\nthat both the MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression increased\nafter CH co-incubated with SP600125 in K562/ADR cells,\nsuggesting CH induced MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression\ndown-regulation is implicated in activating JNK. c-Jun is\na protein that forms the activator protein 1 (AP-1) early\nresponse transcription factor. It is well known that c-Jun can\nbe activated through double phosphorylation on serine 63\nand 73 by the JNK pathway but has also a phosphorylation-\nindependent function [27, 28]. The data presented here\nshowed that CH promoted c-Jun expression and phospho-\nrylation in K562/ADR cells in a time dependence manner,\nsuggesting that c-Jun may be play an important role in\ndownregulation ofMDR1 and P-gp expression.\n\nP-gp\n\n\ud835\udefd-Actin\n\n\u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212 \u2212\n\n+ +\n\n+ +\n\nCH (10\ud835\udf07M)\nSP600125 (2\ud835\udf07M)\n\nFigure 4: Effects of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (2.0\ud835\udf07M) on CH-\ninduced downregulation of P-gp expression byWestern blot analysis\nin K562/ADR cells (1 \u00d7 106). CH-induced downregulation of P-\ngp expression was abolished partly when combined with SP600125\n(2.0 \ud835\udf07M).\n\nIt is worthwhile to note that the role of JNKpathway in the\ndevelopment of MDR is debated. Sui et al. [29] reported that\ninhibition of JNK downregulates the expression ofMDR1/P-\ngp in resistantHCT8/V cells.While our results are in linewith\nthose in the papers by Zhou et al. [13], Miao and Ding [15],\nthat is, the activation of JNK is related to the downregulation\nof MDR1/P-gp expression. This may reflect a complicated\nnature ofMDR1/P-gp regulation by JNKwith the involvement\nof P-gp modulators.\n\nIn conclusion, these results for the first time demonstrate\nthat CH downregulates MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression\nby activating JNK/c-Jun.
