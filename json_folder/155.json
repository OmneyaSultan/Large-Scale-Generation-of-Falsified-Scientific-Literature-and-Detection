The aim\nof this study was to further investigate the mechanism of this activation. Isolated hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers induced DNA\nfragmentation in response to IFN-a2b, which was completely blocked when anti-TGF-b1 was added to the culture media. IFN-a2b med-\niated radical oxygen species (ROS) production that preceded the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DW), release of cyto-\nchrome c, and activation of caspase-3. Bax levels increased in a time-dependent fashion, and Bcl-xL was down-regulated in the early\nhours of IFN-a2b treatment. The delayed translocation of Bid into the mitochondria was in concordance with late caspase-8 activation.\nIn conclusion, endogenous TGF-b1 secreted under IFN-a2b stimulus seems to induce cytochrome c release through a mechanism related\nto Bcl-2 family members and loss of mitochondrial DW. Bax protein could be responsible of the release of cytochrome c during the initial\nhours of IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis via TGF-b1. Activated Bid by caspases could amplificate the mitochondrial events, enhancing the\nrelease of cytochrome c.\n\ufffd 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, it has\nbeen stated that IFN-a applied in the early stages of tumor\nevolution could have a very important clinical effect, whereas\nits activity in advanced stages would be minimal [3]. We have\npreviously shown that IFN-a2b induces apoptosis in isolated\nhepatocytes from preneoplastic rat livers [4]. The apoptotic\neffect of IFN-a2b was mediated by the production of\nTGF-b1 from hepatocytes, due to the fact that when anti-\nTGF-b1 was added to the culture media, IFN-a2b-induced\napoptosis was completely blocked.\n\nApoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an essential\nphysiologic process required for normal development and\nmaintenance of liver homeostasis. However, apoptosis is\n\nmailto:mcarrill@fbioyf.unr.edu.ar\nmailto:carrillo@ifise.gov.ar\n\n\n246 M.L. Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253\nalso involved in pathologic conditions, including liver\nregression, physical and chemical liver injury, viral hepa-\ntitis, and liver carcinogenesis [5]. The aspartate-specific-\ncysteine-protease (caspase) cascade is now believed to be\nthe main pathway by which cellular death is orchestrated\n[6]. There are two pathways by which caspase activation is\ntriggered: the extrinsic and the intrinsic. Both pathways\nconverge on the activation of caspase-3. This caspase is\nultimately responsible for the majority of the effects [7].\nThe extrinsic pathway is activated by the engagement of\ndeath receptors on the cell surface. Caspase-8 is the key\ninitiator caspase in the death-receptor pathway [8]. The\nintrinsic pathway or non-receptor-mediated apoptosis is\ntriggered by various extracellular and intracellular stress-\nes, such as growth factor withdrawal, hypoxia, DNA\ndamage, and oncogene induction. Signals that are trans-\nduced in response to these stresses result in the permeabi-\nlization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, release of\ncytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic molecules, forma-\ntion of the apoptosome, and caspase activation [9].\nAmong these processes, only the permeabilization step is\nregulated, and several members of the Bcl-2 family are\ninvolved in this regulation. The anti-apoptotic proteins\nBcl-2 and Bcl-xL can stop the march towards apoptotic\ndeath by preventing cytochrome c release [10], whereas\ntranslocation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bid) to\nthe mitochondria can induce the release of cytochrome c\ncontained in the intermembrane space. Once cytochrome\nc is released, the downstream cascade of caspase activa-\ntion is irreversible [11].\n\nThe endogenous transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-\nb1) is an important physiological mediator for apoptosis\nin both normal and neoplastic liver [12]. It has been\nreported that TGF-b1 plays an important role as an\ninducer of apoptosis in a variety of cells, including pri-\nmary hepatocytes [13], fetal rat hepatocytes [14], and\nhepatoma cell lines [15\u201317]. Although the mechanisms\nby which TGF-b1 induces apoptosis in hepatocytes have\nnot been fully elucidated, it is well established that TGF-\nb1 mediates radical oxygen species (ROS) production\nthat contributes to the down-regulation of Bcl-xL, the\nrelease of cytochrome c, and the activation of at least\ncaspases-2, -3, -8, and -9 [14\u201319]. However, the involve-\nment of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-xL proteins in TGF-b1-in-\nduced apoptosis has not been completely established.\nTGF-b1 decreased the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in\ndiverse hepatoma cell lines [16,20] whereas in other hep-\natoma cells no changes in Bax or Bcl-xL were observed\n[17]. On the other hand, overexpression of Bcl-2 blocked\ninduction of apoptosis by TGF-b1 in human hepatoma\ncells [21].\n\nIn the current study, we wished to further investigate the\nmechanism of caspase activation during IFN-a2b-induced\napoptosis via TGF-b1. For this purpose, experiments were\nperformed to characterize the time-dependent effects of\nIFN-a2b via TGF-b1 on hepatocytes from preneoplastic\nlivers.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Chemicals\n\nDiethylnitrosamine (DEN), 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-\nAAF), 2 0,7 0-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA),\nand collagenase were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.\nIFN-a2b was kindly provided by BioSidus Laboratory\n(Buenos Aires, Argentina). Anti-caspase-3 (L-18), anti-cas-\npase-8 (H-134), anti-cytochrome c, anti-Bax, anti-Bcl-xL,\nanti-Bid, and secondary antibodies were obtained from\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology. The fluorogenic substrates for\ncaspase-3 N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC (Ac-DEVD-\nAMC) and for caspase-8 N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-AMC\n(Ac-IETD-AMC) were purchased from Alexis Co. Fluores-\ncent probe tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM)\nwas from Fluka. All other chemicals were of the highest\ngrade commercially available.\n\n2.2. Animals and treatment\n\nAdult male Wistar rats (330\u2013380 g) were maintained in a\nroom at constant temperature with a 12 h light\u2013dark cycle,\nwith free access to food and water. The experimental pro-\ntocol was performed according to the \u2018\u2018Guide for the Care\nand Use of Laboratory Animals\u2019\u2019 (National Institutes of\nHealth, publication no. 25\u201328, revised 1996). The animals\nwere subjected to a two-phase model of rat hepatocarcino-\ngenesis, for details see Ref. [22]. The initiation stage was\nperformed by the administration of two i.p. necrogenic\ndoses of DEN (150 mg/kg body weight) 2 weeks apart.\nOne week after the last injection of DEN, the rats received\n20 mg/kg body weight of 2-AAF by gavage for four\nconsecutive days per week during 3 weeks.\n\n2.3. Cell isolation and culture\n\nHepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion and\nmechanical disruption as described previously [23]. A hepa-\ntocyte-enriched population from the entire liver containing\nboth preneoplastic hepatocytes plus hepatocytes from the\nsurrounding non-preneoplastic liver tissue was obtained\nby centrifugation twice at 40 g [24]. To remove residual\nadherent cells from the hepatocytes, the suspension was\nincubated twice for 20 min in plastic dishes and the hepato-\ncytes were transferred on culture plates.\n\nCells were cultured at 37 \ufffdC in a humidified atmosphere\nof 5% CO2 in RPMI medium with L-glutamine supple-\nmented with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and strepto-\nmycin (100 lg/mL). Two hours later, the medium was\nchanged to fresh medium supplemented with 0.2% FCS,\nand cells were treated with 105 U/mL IFN-a2b or left\nuntreated. This dose of IFN-a2b induced in vitro a similar\nincrement of hepatocytes apoptosis than the one observed\nin vivo, when rats with preneoplasia received IFN-a2b at\ntherapeutic doses [22]. Cells were cultured at different\ntimes: 1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h.\n\n\n\nM.L. Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253 247\nThe viability of all cell suspensions used, checked by\nTrypan blue exclusion, was between 85% and 95%.\n\n2.4. TGF-b1 assay\n\nHepatocyte-conditioned media were collected at the dif-\nferent times and TGF-b1 was quantitated using an ELISA\ntest (R&D Systems).\n\n2.5. Analysis of apoptosis by DNA fragmentation\n\nHepatocytes cultured at different times were scrapped off\nand centrifuged, lysed with 5 mmol/L Tris/HCl (pH 8.0),\n20 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and stored at\n4 \ufffdC for 15 min. Intact nuclei were eliminated by centrifu-\ngation and the supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000g for\n30 min at 4 \ufffdC. DNA in the supernatant was purified as\ndescribed previously [25]. Cytosolic DNA was subjected\nto 10% PAGE. The gel was incubated for 30 min with\n0.5 lg/mL ethidium bromide and visualized under trans-\nmitted ultraviolet light by using the BioChemi System.\n\n2.6. Analysis of apoptosis by annexin V staining\n\nApoptosis was investigated using the FITC-Annexin V\nApoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences). Cultured hepatocytes\nwere stained according to the manufacturer\u2019s suggestions.\nThen cells were washed, fixed, and viewed under fluores-\ncence microscope. Apoptotic cells were counted by examin-\ning >1000 cells/dish and expressed per 100 hepatocytes.\n\n2.7. Measurement of intracellular ROS\n\nFormation of ROS was determined as previously\ndescribed [26,27], with slight modifications. Cells cultured\nat different times were loaded with 5 lM DCFH-DA for\n20 min at 37 \ufffdC with 5% CO2. Fluorescence was measured\non a Shimadzu Spectrofluorophotometer RF-5301 PC\n(excitation wavelength 488 nm, emission wavelength\n525 nm).\n\n2.8. Preparation of mitochondria-enriched fractions and\n\ncytosolic extracts\n\nHepatocytes were scrapped off the plates, and centri-\nfuged, washed, and resuspended in 300 mmol/L sucrose\nwith protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted by sonication\nand incubated at 4 \ufffdC for 15 min and lysates were centri-\nfuged at 1000g. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were\nthen produced as described by de Duve et al. [28]. Proteins\nwere quantified according to Lowry et al. [29]. Enrichment\nof each cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions was deter-\nmined by the measurement of specific activities of succinate\ncytochrome c reductase (mitochondrial marker) and lactate\ndehydrogenase (cytosolic marker) [30]. The specific activity\nof lactate dehydrogenase in cytosol was 9 \u00b1 2-fold higher\nthan in the mitochondrial fraction, whereas the specific\nactivity of succinate cytochrome c reductase in mitochon-\ndria was 17 \u00b1 2-fold higher than in cytosol.\n\n2.9. Analysis of caspases-3 and -8 activities\n\nCaspases-3 and -8 activities were evaluated by measur-\ning the proteolytic cleavage of their fluorogenic substrates\nAc-DEVD-AMC and Ac-IETD-AMC, respectively,\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s suggestions. Briefly, cyto-\nsolic extract (50 lg of protein) was added into reaction\nbuffer containing 20 mmol/L Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol,\n2 mmol/L DTT, and 200 lmol/L caspase substrate. The\nreaction mixture was incubated at 37 \ufffdC for 1 h. After that\ntime, enzymatic activity was measured in a luminescence\nspectrometer (Aminco-Bowman Series 2) (excitation\nwavelength 380 nm, emission wavelength 460 nm).\n\n2.10. Western blot analysis\n\nProcaspases-3 and -8 were detected in cytosolic extracts\n(20 lg per lane), cytochrome c was analyzed in mitochon-\ndrial and cytosolic fractions (5 lg protein/condition).\nBax, Bcl-xL, and Bid were explored in mitochondria-en-\nriched fractions (30 lg protein for Bax and Bcl-xL, and\n15 lg for Bid). Samples were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE\nand electroblotted onto polyvinyl difluoride membranes.\nImmunoblots were blocked and incubated overnight at\n4 \ufffdC with the primary antibody (1:500). Finally, they were\nincubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody\n(1:5000) and bands were detected by ECL detection system\n(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoreactive\nbands were quantified using the Gel-Pro Analyzer (Media\nCybernetics) software. In all Western blotting analysis,\nthe uniformity of protein loading was checked using\nPonceau S.\n\n2.11. Analysis of mitochondrial transmembrane potential\n\nTo examine mitochondrial DW, cultured hepatocytes\nwere loaded with TMRM, a membrane-permeable cationic\nfluorophore that accumulates in mitochondria in propor-\ntion to their DW [31]. DW was determined by using a ratio\nfluorescence approach [32].\n\n2.12. Statistical analysis\n\nThe results were expressed as means \u00b1 SE. Significance\nin differences was tested by one-way ANOVA, followed\nby Tukey test. Differences were considered significant when\nthe p value was < 0.05.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1.

Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253\nwere stimulated with IFN-a2b at 1 and 4 h of culture.\nHowever, IFN-a2b presence in the culture media induced\na twofold increase of TGF-b1 secretion at 7 h of culture.\nTGF-b1 levels continued significantly increased at 20 and\n24 h of culture (Fig. 1).\n\n3.2. DNA fragmentation analysis\n\nAccording to other authors [25], only cytosolic, frag-\nmented DNA was isolated, due to the fact that in total\nDNA isolation experiments it was difficult to observe the\ntypical oligosomal ladder.\n\nA representative time dependence study of the cell death\nprocess is shown in Fig. 2a. Cultured hepatocytes did not\nshow DNA ladder after 1 and 4 h of IFN-a2b stimulus.\nA very small amount of low molecular weight DNA frag-\nmentation was first observed at 7 h of incubation with\nIFN-a2b, and continuously increased for the next studied\nhours, reaching a maximum at 24 h of culture. In contrast,\nfragmented DNA was not observed in cultured cells that\nwere left untreated at all studied times (data not shown).\nFig. 2. Effect of IFN-a2b on DNA fragmentation. Hepatocytes from\npreneoplastic livers were incubated for 1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h without (not\nshown) and with IFN-a2b (a), and also with IFN-a2b plus anti-TGF-b1\n(b). Cells were lysed and subjected to cytoplasmic DNA extraction.\nPurified low molecular weight DNA was electrophoresed on 10%\npolyacrylamide gel and visualized by ultraviolet fluorescence by staining\nwith ethidium bromide. A representative experiment is shown.\nIn addition, experiments were performed with IFN-a2b\nplus anti-TGF-b1 to demonstrate whether the DNA frag-\nmentation observed in IFN-a2b-treated cells is mediated\nby the production of TGF-b1 from hepatocytes. When\nanti-TGF-b1 was added to the culture media, no DNA\ncleavage was detected (Fig. 2b).\n\n3.3. Annexin V staining analysis\n\nTable 1 shows the percentage of apoptotic hepatocytes\nby annexin V staining at the different hours of culture.\nThe percentage of apoptotic cells in IFN-a2b-treated cul-\ntures significantly increased over unstimulated cultures at\n20 and 24 h. When anti-TGF-b1 was added to the culture\nmedia, no increase in the percentage of apoptotic hepato-\ncytes could be detected.\n\n3.4. ROS production analysis\n\nIt has been described that TGF-b1-induced apoptosis in\nrat fetal hepatocytes is mediated by ROS production [25].\nIn this work, we examined whether the generation of\nROS is involved in the IFN-a2b-induced apoptotic cell\ndeath of hepatocytes from rat preneoplastic livers. For this\npurpose, we used DCFH-DA, an oxidation-sensitive fluo-\nrescent probe [27]. Cells were incubated at different times\n(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h) with or without IFN-\na2b. Hepatocytes stimulated with this cytokine showed a\nmaximum increase in ROS production at 1 h of culture\n(Fig. 3). After this time, ROS decreased, returning to con-\ntrol values. The presence of anti-TGF-b1 did not affect the\npeak of ROS observed at 1 h of culture.\n\n3.5. Caspases-3 and -8 activation analysis\n\nIn this work, time-course experiments to analyse the\nactivities of caspases-3 and -8, and the expressions of\nprocaspases-3 and -8 following IFN-a2b treatment were\nperformed. These procaspases are converted into active\nsubunits during the course of activation [16]. Thus,\ndecreases in densities of procaspase-3 or -8 bands indicate\nactivation of the respective caspase.\n\n\n\nFig. 3. IFN-a2b induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species content.\nHepatocytes from preneoplastic livers were cultured for different times\n(0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h) in the absence or presence of IFN-a2b.\nThe production of ROS was analyzed as described in Section 2. Results\nfrom IFN-a2b- (black circles) and IFN-a2b plus anti-TGF-b1- (white\ncircles) treated hepatocytes are expressed as percentages of control\n(untreated) cells and are means \u00b1 SE from at least four independent\nexperiments. *p < 0.05 vs. untreated cells.\n\nM.L. Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253 249\nFigs. 4a and b show that caspase-3 like and caspase-8\nactivities significantly increased at 24 h of culture under\nIFN-a2b stimulus (40% and 85%, respectively, compared\nwith untreated cells). Before this time, no increase in casp-\nases-3 and -8 activities could be detected. According to\nthese results, procaspase-3 and procaspase-8 levels signifi-\ncantly decreased after 24 h of IFN-a2b treatment (Figs.\n4c and d). Besides, immunoblotting studies showed that\nFig. 4. Time course analysis of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation during IFN\ncourse analysis of (a) caspase-3 and (b) caspase-8 activities. Cells were incubate\ntime (1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h), and caspases-3 and -8 activities were assayed.

Hepatocytes were untreated (\ufffd) or treated (+) with IFN-\nprocaspase-3 levels started to diminish at 20 h of culture\nin presence of IFN-a2b, whereas procaspase-8 levels start-\ned to decrease at 7 h of stimulation with IFN-a2b,\nalthough these decreases were not statistically significant.\nOn the other hand, no changes in procaspase-3 or\nprocaspase-8 protein levels were observed in unstimulated\ncultured hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers (Figs. 4c\nand d).\n\nThese data showed that caspases-3 and -8 were pro-\ncessed and activated during IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis\nvia TGF-b1. However, there was no clear evidence if one\ncaspase is being activated before the other.\n3.6. Release of cytochrome c and mitochondrial\n\ntransmembrane potential analysis\n\nWe studied the intracellular distribution of cytochrome\nc in IFN-a2b-stimulated hepatocytes from preneoplastic\nlivers. As early as 4 h after treating with IFN-a2b, there\nwas a significant increase in the cytochrome c content of\nthe cytosol and its levels increased over time, reaching a\nmaximum at 20 h. At the same time, cytochrome c content\ndecreased in the mitochondria. These results showed that\nthe release of the cytochrome c was an early cellular\nresponse to TGF-b1 (Figs. 5a and b).\n\nThe disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane poten-\ntial (DW) has been defined as an early irreversible stage of\napoptosis, preceding caspase-3 activation [10]. In agree-\nment with results previously reported for adult and fetal\nrat hepatocytes [33,34], in this work we presented evidence\nthat the loss of mitochondrial DW was coincident with the\n-a2b-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes from rat preneoplastic livers.

Analysis of the Bcl-2 family proteins expression\n\nThe Bcl-2 family of proteins is related to the mitochon-\ndrial changes during apoptosis. Bax and Bcl-xL involve-\nment in TGF-b1-induced programmed cell death is\ncontroversial [16,17,20]. So, we analyzed Bax and Bcl-xL\nmitochondrial content in hepatocytes from preneoplastic\nlivers. Results showed that the levels of Bax increased in\nmitochondria of hepatocytes after 4 h of IFN-a2b treat-\nment (30% compared with untreated cells) and augmented\nin a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum at 20 h\nof culture (95% of increase with respect to unstimulated\ncells) (Fig. 6a). It is well known that IFN-a induces apop-\ntosis in different tumor cell lines through the activation of\npro-apoptotic Bax [35], so we have included Bax activation\nstudies in cultured cells treated with IFN-a2b and anti-\nTGF-b1 in order to discard a possible induction of Bax\nby IFN-a2b itself. The results indicated that the presence\nof anti-TGF-b1 in the culture media of IFN-a2b-stimulated\nhepatocytes completely blocked the increase of mitochon-\ndrial Bax protein levels at the studied times (data not\nFig. 6. Role of Bcl-2 family proteins in IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis of\nhepatocytes from preneoplastic livers. (a) Kinetic study of Bax and Bcl-xL\nmitochondrial levels, analyzed by Western blot.

(b) A representative experiment of a Western\nblot analysis of Bax, Bcl-xL, and Bid protein levels in mitochondria\nfractions is shown.\n\n\n\nM.L. Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253 251\nshown). So, Bax up-regulation in IFN-a2b-treated cells is\nmediated by the TGF-b1 secreted from hepatocytes.\n\nOn the other hand, Bcl-xL mitochondrial content was\ndecreased in IFN-a2b-stimulated cells already at 1 h of\ntreatment (30% compared with untreated cells), and reached\na diminution of 50% at 7 h (Fig. 6a). This down-regulation of\nBcl-xL in the early hours of apoptosis, although no signifi-\ncant during the time-course study, is in agreement with pre-\nvious reports [14,16]. Moreover, Bax/Bcl-xL expression ratio\nwas calculated from the densitometric analysis of Western\nblots; the ratio clearly increased during the studied times:\n1.5 \u00b1 0.1, 1.6 \u00b1 0.2, 2.7 \u00b1 0.3, 3.5 \u00b1 0.4, and 3.3 \u00b1 0.3, at\n1, 4, 7, 20, and 24 h, respectively.\n\nWe also examined the mitochondrial levels of pro-apop-\ntotic protein Bid. Caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid\ngreatly increases its pro-death activity and results in trans-\nlocation to mitochondria, where promotes cytochrome c\nrelease [35]. Fig. 6b shows that truncated Bid increased in\nmitochondria after 20 h of culture. As expected, this\ndelayed translocation of Bid protein was in concordance\nwith a late caspase-8 activation.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nDysregulation of apoptosis has been implicated in\nnumerous pathological conditions, including cancer, auto-\nimmune disorders, viral infections, and others [5,7]. Efforts\naimed at treating these diseases by manipulating cell suicide\nwould seem to have great potential, although they are at a\nrelatively early stage.\n\nIn a previous work [4], we showed that IFN-a2b-in-\nduced production of TGF-b1 by hepatocytes from preneo-\nplastic livers is involved in the apoptotic elimination of\npreneoplastic foci. In vitro studies revealed enhanced apop-\ntosis of IFN-a2b-treated hepatocytes at 24 h of culture,\nand this effect was mediated by hepatocytic TGF-b1.\nTherefore, we investigated the mechanisms of IFN-a2b-in-\nduced apoptosis via TGF-b1 in isolated hepatocytes from\npreneoplastic rat livers by exploring some critical factors\ninvolved in the apoptotic pathway.\n\nThe present work was made on a mixed population of\nhepatocytes (preneoplastic plus surrounding cells).\nAlthough we were unable to separate both populations,\nthe study of the apoptotic phenomenon induced by IFN-\na2b in the whole preneoplastic liver is of great interest, due\nto the fact that patients with liver diseases treated with this\ncytokine, such as chronic hepatitis B or C, may already have\nsmall, clinically undetectable preneoplastic foci during\ntherapy.\n\nThe induction of apoptosis by IFN-a2b was determined\nby annexin V staining. As previously reported [4], the per-\ncentage of apoptotic hepatocytes in IFN-a2b-treated cul-\ntures increased twofold over unstimulated cultures at\n24 h. The same increase was also observed at 20 h of\nIFN-a2b stimulus. In accordance, the analysis of DNA\nfragmentation showed a maximal increase of cytosolic\nDNA at 24 h of culture. The addition of anti-TGF-b1\nblocked hepatocytes apoptosis, with no increase in DNA\nfragmentation and percentages of apoptotic hepatocytes,\nsimilar to those in unstimulated cultures.\n\nReactive oxygen intermediates, such as hydrogen perox-\nides or oxygen radicals, are integral control elements in the\ncell\u2019s decision to enter apoptosis. IFN-a2b-mediated apop-\ntosis via TGF-b1 in hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers\nwas preceded by an enhancement of ROS production. An\nearly ROS production induced by TGF-b1 has been previ-\nously described in fetal rat hepatocytes [14,34]. However, in\nthe present study the maximum increase in ROS at 1 h after\nIFN-a2b treatment was not coincident with the highest\nconcentration of TGF-b1 in conditioned media detected\nafter 7 h of treatment. Moreover, the peak of ROS at 1 h\nwas not affected by the presence of anti-TGF-b1 in the cul-\nture media. In consequence, the increase of ROS might be\nmediated by IFN-a2b but not by TGF-b1. It has been\nshown that IFN-c induces ROS generation via upregula-\ntion of NADPH oxidase, a ROS-producing system [37].\nThe same mechanism has been described to be activated\nby IFN-a in human neutrophils [38]. So, it is possible that\nin our model IFN-a2b could be raising ROS levels by\nNADPH oxidase induction. Moreover, further work with\nscavengers of reactive species is in process to provide\ndirect evidence that the generation of ROS is involved in\nthe IFN-a2b-induced apoptosis.\n\nIn the current study, we observed that caspases-3 and -\n8 were activated in IFN-a2b-treated hepatocytes from pre-\nneoplastic livers. Previous studies have indicated that acti-\nvation of caspase-8 precedes the activation of caspase-3 in\nTGF-b1-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells [16]. Howev-\ner, we were unable to define an ordered and sequential\nprocessing of individual caspases. On the other hand,\nScaffidi et al. [39] previously reported that in some types\nof cells such as liver cells there is a minimal amount of\nreceptor-activated caspase-8 and probably insufficient to\ninduce downstream effector caspase cleavage. This low\ncaspase-8 activity is thought not to be usually detected\nbut to be enough to cleave Bid. Truncated Bid then trans-\nlocates to the mitochondria where initiates mitochondria-\ndependent apoptotic signals including cytochrome c\nrelease and efficient activation of both caspases-8 and -3.\nIn view of the fact that procaspase-8 levels started to\ndecrease at 7 h of IFN-a2b treatment, we studied Bid pro-\ntein mitochondrial levels. The delayed translocation of Bid\nto the mitochondria (after 20 h of culture, see Fig. 6b)\nallowed us to ascertain that the mechanism postulated\nby Scaffidi et al. [39] is unlikely to contribute significantly\nto the apoptotic effect of IFN-a2b on hepatocytes from\npreneoplastic livers.\n\nIn the present study, Bax increased in a time-dependent\nfashion, and Bcl-xL was down-regulated in the early hours\nof IFN-a2b treatment. Therefore, the relative ratio\nincreased during the studied times, clearly favoring the\napoptotic process. It has been reported that TGF-b1 can\ndown-regulate Bcl-xL protein levels in some hepatoma cells\n[16,20] and fetal rat hepatocytes [18] without affecting Bax\n\n\n\n252 M.L. Alvarez et al. / Cytokine 36 (2006) 245\u2013253\nexpression. Therefore, to our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy where TGF-b1 induced mitochondrial Bax overex-\npression in hepatic cells.\n\nWe have also shown that cytochrome c is early released\ninto the cytoplasm in the time course of TGF-b1-induced\napoptosis (Fig. 5). This suggested that an apoptosome-\nlike-caspase-activation mechanism could be involved. The\nexact mechanism by which cytochrome c is released from\nthe mitochondria during the apoptosis has not been eluci-\ndated. Current ideas suggest that Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL prevent\nthe release of cytochrome c and, therefore, suppress apop-\ntosis, whereas Bax and cleaved Bid promotes cytochrome c\nrelease and apoptotic cell death [9,40]. In our study, the\nrelease of cytochrome c into the cytosol was coincident\nwith the increase of Bax protein levels in mitochondria.\nThese data are in good agreement with previous observa-\ntions that Bax protein can directly induce the release of\ncytochrome c, without apparent requirement for caspases\n[41]. On the other hand, it has been reported that Bid is\na much more potent cytochrome c-releasing factor than\nBax [36]. In accordance with this, the maximal levels of\ncytochrome c found in cytosol at 20 h were corresponded\nwith augmented levels of Bid protein in mitochondria.\n\nIn conclusion, IFN-a2b treatment of hepatocytes from\npreneoplastic rat livers produced an increase in ROS and\nTGF-b1 secretion. This growth factor seems to induce cyto-\nchrome c release through a mechanism related to Bcl-2\nfamily members. Bax protein could be responsible of the\nrelease of cytochrome c during the initial hours of IFN-\na2b-induced apoptosis via TGF-b1, whereas at later times\n(after 20 h of culture) activation of Bid by caspases could\namplificate the mitochondrial events, enhancing the release\nof cytochrome c.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by Research Grant PICT 05-\n11107 (M.C.
