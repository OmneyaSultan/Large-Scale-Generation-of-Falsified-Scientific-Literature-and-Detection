In this study, we demonstrate a role for REST in the control of proliferation of medulloblastoma cells.\nREST expression decreased the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)NIB/p27, a CDK inhibitor and a brake of cell proliferation\nin these cells. The reciprocal relationship between REST and p27 was validated in human tumor samples. REST knockdown in\nmedulloblastoma cells derepessed a novel REST target gene encoding the deubiquitylase ubiquitin (Ub)-specific peptidase 37\n(USP37). Ectopically expressed wild-type USP37 formed a complex with p27, promoted its deubiquitination and stabilization and\nblocked cell proliferation. Knockdown of REST and USP37 prevented p27 stabilization and blocked the diminution in proliferative\npotential that normally accompanied REST loss. Unexpectedly, wild-type USP37 expression also induced the expression of REST-\ntarget neuronal differentiation genes even though REST levels were unaffected. In contrast, a mutant of USP37 carrying a site-\ndirected change in a conserved cysteine failed to rescue REST-mediated p27 destabilization, maintenance of cell proliferation and\nblockade to neuronal differentiation. Consistent with these findings, a significant correlation between USP37 and p27 was observed\nin patient tumors. Collectively, these findings provide a novel connection between REST and the proteasomal machinery in the\ncontrol of p27 and cell proliferation in medulloblastoma cells.\n\nOncogene (2013) 32, 1691\u20131701; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.182; published online 4 June 2012\n\nKeywords: REST; proliferation; p27; USP37; deubiquitylase\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is an important\nregulator of neuronal differentiation.1\u201310 It is expressed in neural\nprogenitors, but downregulated in most differentiated neurons.1\u201311\n\nREST binds a 21-23-bp sequence called the RE1 element found in\nthe regulatory regions of target genes through a centrally located\nDNA-binding domain.1\u20139 REST has two independent repressor\ndomains located at the N and carboxy termini of the protein.3\u20139\n\nThe amino-terminal repression domain is associated with mSin3a\nand HDAC1/2, whereas the carboxy-terminal repression domain\ncomplexes with co-REST, the chromatin remodeling protein Brg1,\nG9a histone methyltransferase, LSD1 lysine demethylase and\nHDAC1/2.3\u201310 Acting through these complexes, REST represses\ntarget gene expression in neural progenitors. A number of these\ngenes are involved in neurogenesis. The decline in REST expression\nat onset of neuronal specification derepresses these target genes\nand allows terminal neuronal differentiation.1\u201310\n\nConsistent with a role for REST in neuronal differentiation,\nprevious studies have shown that its expression is aberrantly\nmaintained in the undifferentiated neural tumor of childhood\ncalled medulloblastoma.12\u201314 V-Myc-immortalized murine cerebellar\n\nprogenitor cells (CPCs; NSC-M) that were engineered to\nconstitutively express human REST transgene (NSC-MR) were\nblocked in neuronal differentiation and formed tumors when\ninjected into the cerebellum of mice.13 In contrast, parental v-Myc-\nimmortalized progenitors (NSC-M) underwent neuronal\ndifferentiation in vitro and failed to form tumors in vivo.13\n\nImportantly, constitutive REST expression provided a proliferation\nadvantage to NSC-MR cells in vitro.13 In the study described here,\nwe evaluated if REST had a direct role in the control of cell\nproliferation and also investigated the underlying molecular\nmechanisms.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the importance of the\n\ncyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p27/Kip1 in the control of\nproliferation and cell exit in CPCs, the cells of origin of a subset of\nmedulloblastoma.15\u201320 Mice that are heterozygous or nullizygous\nfor p27 exhibit cerebellar enlargement stemming from\nhyperproliferation of CPCs.15\u201317 Cytoplasmic mislocalization of\np27 is also associated with uncontrolled CPC proliferation.18 These\naberrations in p27 biology contribute to medulloblastoma\nformation in the background of constitutive sonic hedge-\nhog (Shh) signaling.18\u201321 In this study, we provide evidence that\n\n1Department of Pediatrics and Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas M.

A significant\ncorrelation between p27, REST and USP37 was also seen in\nhuman tumor samples. Ectopically expressed USP37 formed a\ncomplex with p27, promoted its stabilization, blocked cell\nproliferation and induced the expression of REST-target\nneuronal differentiation genes. In contrast, ectopic expression\nof a USP37 transgene carrying a mutation in a conserved cysteine\nresidue failed to rescue REST-dependent effects on p27, cell\nproliferation and neuronal differentiation. As concomitant loss of\nREST and USP37 expression attenuated p27 stabilization and\ndifferentiation and rescued cell proliferation, our data strongly\nsuggest that repression of USP37 and consequent p27\ndegradation, are important for REST-dependent maintenance of\ncell proliferation.\n\nRESULTS\nREST controls cell proliferation\nREST has been mostly studied in the context of its function as a\nregulator of neuronal differentiation genes. Our previous studies\nshowed that elevated REST expression in v-Myc-immortalized\nNSC-MR cells provided proliferation advantage to these cells.13 To\ndetermine whether REST had a direct role in maintaining cell\nproliferation, we knocked down endogenous REST gene\nexpression in DAOY and D283 medulloblastoma cell lines\nthrough transient transfection of pooled REST-specific siRNA or\ncontrol scrambled (scr) siRNA. REST knockdown was confirmed by\nquantitative real time (qRT)\u2013PCR and western blotting analyses\n(Figures 1d and e). A decline in REST expression promoted a\n50\u201360% decline in total cell numbers relative to control scr-siRNA-\ntransfected cell numbers (Figure 1a). To determine whether this\ndecrease in cell numbers upon REST loss was mediated by an\neffect on cell proliferation, DAOY and D283 cells with or without\nREST expression were costained for REST and Ki-67 using specific\nantibodies and analyzed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA).\nPercentage decrease in Ki-67 staining in cells lacking REST relative\nto control REST-expressing cells was between 50 and 70%\n(Figure 1b). Flow cytometric analysis was also used to assess\nchanges in the cell cycle distribution of DAOY cells in the presence\nor absence of REST expression. Loss of REST expression promoted\nan increase in the number of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle\nfrom 53 to 63, which was associated with a corresponding\ndecrease in the number of cells in S phase (17 to 7%; Figure 1c).\nA significant change in the number of cells with a sub-G1 or G2/M\nDNA content was not detected, indicating that apoptosis was not\na major consequence of REST loss in our assays (Figure 1c). REST\nloss and consequent increase in the expression of its target gene\nSyn1 was also confirmed by qRT\u2013PCR analyses (Figure 1d).\nWestern blotting also revealed REST loss to cause a decrease in\nthe levels of the pro-proliferative marker N-Myc and an increase\nthe levels of the inhibitor of cell proliferation, p27, in DAOY and\nD283 cells (Figure 1e).17,19\u201321,25,26 Levels of the CDKI p21 were\nelevated in DAOY cells but not in D283 cells following REST loss.\nInterestingly, REST expression was associated with the presence of\nslower migrating forms of p27 in both DAOY and D283 cells.\nConversely, the increase in p27 levels following REST knockdown\nwas accompanied by the emergence of a ladder of faster\nmigrating forms of the protein. Nuclear localization of p27,\nwhich is important for its function as a CDKI, was also observed\nupon REST knockdown (data not shown). These data implicate\nREST in the control of cell proliferation and potentially through\nregulation of p27 protein levels.\n\nREST and p27 are reciprocally expressed in human\nmedulloblastoma samples\nThe relationship between REST and p27 observed in medullo-\nblastoma cell lines was also validated in human tumor samples.\nFollowing Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, de-identified\npatient samples were costained for REST and p27 proteins using\nspecific antibodies and studied by IFA. Staining in representative\ntumors and control normal cerebellum is shown in Figure 2a (top\npanel). The corresponding hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H&E)-stained sec-\ntions are included in the bottom panel (Figure 2a). REST was\nexpressed in all tumor samples in a focally elevated pattern, but\nnot in the control normal cerebellum. In contrast, p27 was\nexpressed in the normal cerebellum and either absent or present\nat low levels in tumors. Specifically, a total of 45 human tumors\nwere analyzed for REST and p27 expression and scored on a scale\n\nDAOY D283\n\nsiRNA RE\nST\n\nsc\nr\n\nRE\nST\n\nsc\nr\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n100\n\nSubG1 G1 S G2/M\n\nC\ne\nll\n\ns\n N\n\nu\nm\n\nb\ne\nrs\n\n (\n%\n\n) \n\nDAOY scr \nsi-REST  \n\n7%6%\n\n63%\n53%\n\n17%\n7%\n\n20%\n20%\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n G\n\ne\nn\n\ne\n E\n\nx\np\n\nre\ns\ns\nio\n\nn\n\nsiRNA RESTscr\n\n20\n30\n40\n50\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\nREST RESTSYN\n\nSYN\n\nD\nA\n\nO\nY\n\nD\nA\n\nO\nY\n\nD\n2\n8\n3\n\nD\n2\n8\n3\n\nD\nA\n\nO\nY\n\nD\nA\n\nO\nY\n\nD\n2\n8\n3\n\nD\n2\n8\n3\n\n60\n70\n\nsiRNA scr REST\n\nC\ne\nll\n\n N\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nrs\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n20\n\n40\n\n80\n\n60\n\n100\n\nK\ni-\n\n6\n7\n S\n\nta\nin\n\nin\ng\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nsiRNA\n\n20\n\n40\n\n80\n\n60\n\n100\n\nUb-p27\n(27-250kD)\n\np27 (27 kD)\n\nN-Myc (67 kD)\n\nGAPDH(35 kD)\n\nREST (180 kD)\n\np21 (21 kD)\n\nTUBIII (50 kD)\n\nDAOY\nD283\n\nDAOY\nD283\n\nscr REST\n\nFigure 1.

Approximately, 27 of\nthe 45 samples (60%) showing focal REST expression (\u00fe /\u00fe \u00fe /\n\u00fe \u00fe \u00fe /\u00fe \u00fe \u00fe \u00fe ) had no detectable p27 protein. A majority\n(16/27) of these p27-negative tumors exhibited very high REST\nexpression (\u00fe \u00fe \u00fe \u00fe ) and 12/27 of p27-negative tumors exhibit\nlower REST staining (\u00fe /\u00fe \u00fe /\u00fe \u00fe \u00fe ). An additional 18 of the 45\nsamples (40%) with REST expression expressed p27 (\u00fe /\u00fe \u00fe /\n\u00fe \u00fe \u00fe ) at levels lower or comparable to normal cerebellum\n(\u00fe \u00fe \u00fe ). The distribution of p27 protein as a function of REST\nlevels is shown in Figures 2b and c. Overall, there was a statistically\nsignificant difference in level of REST protein between tumors with\np27-negative and p27-positive tumors (P\u00bc 0.0008, Wilcoxon rank-\nsum test; P\u00bc 0.0006, t-test).\n\nREST represses the expression of Ub-specific peptidase 37 (USP37)\nThe laddering appearance of p27 protein in REST-expressing cells\nin Figure 1e was suggestive of post-translational regulation and\nmodification by high molecular weight adducts. A number of\nstudies have shown p27 levels to be post-translationally regulated\nby ubiquitination, which targets its for proteasomal degrada-\ntion.27\u201337 To assess if p27 levels were post-translationally\ncontrolled in medulloblastoma cells and required the\nproteasome, translation of new protein synthesis was blocked\nby cycloheximide treatment (0\u2013120min) in DAOY, D283 and\n\nUW228 medulloblastoma cells and p27 levels were measured by\nimmunoblotting. As seen in Figure 3a, there was a substantial\nreduction in p27 levels following cycloheximide treatment, which\ncould be prevented by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. To\nfurther evaluate whether the slower migrating forms of p27 seen\nin REST-expressing cells were ubiquitinated and whether p27\nubiquitination changed in a REST-dependent manner, we\nperformed immunoprecipitation (IP) assays using extracts pre-\npared from DAOY cells transiently transfected with REST siRNA or\nscr siRNA. IP with anti-Ub antibody followed by western blotting\nwith anti-p27 antibody revealed an increase in faster migrating\nforms of p27 in immunoprecipitates from cell extracts lacking\nREST compared with that from cells expressing REST. Reactions\nwith control non-immune sera (immunoglobulin G) were included\nas controls (Figure 3b). Input lanes have been shown separately to\nhighlight differences in the slower migrating forms of p27 in cells\nthat expressed and lacked REST. These results suggest that REST\nloss increased p27 levels by potentially affecting its ubiquitination.\nSkp2, FBXW7 and KPC1/KPC2 are a few E3 ligases known to be\n\nimportant for p27 ubiquitination and proteasomal degrada-\ntion.27\u201337 However, REST knockdown did not cause a change in\nthe levels of these enzymes.

To this end, DAOY and D283 cells were\ntransiently transfected with REST siRNA or scr siRNA and analyzed\n24 h later for the efficiency of REST knockdown and change in\nUSP37 expression by qRT\u2013PCR analysis using 18s RNA as an\ninternal control and for normalization. As shown in Figure 3c, both\nDAOY and D283 cells showed a significant increase in USP37\nexpression (4.5- and 1.6-fold, respectively) following REST knock-\ndown. qRT\u2013PCR analyses also confirmed a substantial diminution\nof USP37 expression in REST-positive established cell lines (DAOY,\nD283) and patient-derived primary cultures (UW-228, UW-426, MB-\n0110, MB-020 and MB-030) compared with normal cerebella\n(Figure 3d). REST binding to the RE1 motif in the USP37 regulatory\nregion and in the positive control Syn1 in DAOY cells was\nconfirmed by chromatin IP (ChIP) analyses (Figure 3e). The signal\n\nobtained with control immunoglobulin (IgG) pull-down was\nsubtracted from that obtained with the specific REST antibody\nand plotted as relative binding. Together these data indicate that\nREST controlled USP37 gene expression.\nThe relationship between USP37 and p27 was also evaluated by\n\nIFA in human medulloblastoma tumor samples. Both p27 and\nUSP37 were expressed in the normal cerebellum whereas their\nexpression was not detected at all or to very low levels in human\ntumors (Figure 4a, top and middle panels). The corresponding\nH&E-stained sections are shown in the bottom panel (Figure 4a).\nOf the 42 human tumor samples studied and scored, 19\n(45%) showed staining for p27 while 23 (55%) did not. Of\nthe p27-negative tumors, 18 (78%) did not express USP37,\n4 (17%) expressed low levels (\u00fe ) of USP37 and 1 (4%) expressed\nmodest levels of USP37 (\u00fe \u00fe \u00fe ). Conversely, normal cerebellum\nexpressed both USP37 and p27. Statistical analyses revealed that\nUSP37 protein expression levels were significantly higher in\np27-positive than in p27-negative tumors (r\u00bc 0.80, Po0.0001,\nSpearman\u2019s correlation; Figures 4b and c).\nThe expression of these proteins was also studied in the normal\n\ncerebellum of postnatal day 7 mice by IFA.

Transgene\nexpression was measured by qRT\u2013PCR analyses and western\nblotting at various times following transfection (Figures 5a and c).\nInteraction between USP37 and p27 was confirmed by co-IP\nexperiments using anti-p27 antibodies or control IgG followed by\nwestern blot analysis using anti-Ub antibodies. Although slower\nmigrating forms of p27, that are presumably ubiquitinated, were\nseen in the presence and absence of ectopic USP37, an increase in\nthe lower molecular weight forms of p27 was observed in USP37\n\n(USP37WT)-expressing cells (Figure 5b). A substantial increase in\np27 protein levels accompanied by a gradual decrease in the\nslower migrating p27 bands over time was also apparent in USP37\ntransgene-expressing cells (Figure 5c). In contrast, a mutant of\nUSP37 carrying a cysteine to serine change at amino-acid 350\n(USP37C350-S), failed to stabilize p27 (Figure 5d). Transient\ntransfection of Myc-tagged USP1 was also ineffective in stabilizing\np27 (Figure 5e). To confirm that USP37 deubiquitinated p27, we\nperformed in vitro DUB assays using purified epitope tagged\nproteins from transiently transfected 293T cells. Addition of USP37\nto a reaction mix containing HA-Ub-Myc-p27 caused a substantial\nincrease in the 27kD form of p27 and a corresponding decrease in\nthe slower migrating forms of the protein relative to reactions\ncontaining USP37 and a protease inhibitor N-ethyl maleimide or\n\np27\n(27-250kD)\n\np27 (27 kD)\n\nREST (180 kD)\n\nUSP37 (120 kD)\n\nGAPDH (35 kD)\n\nGAPDH (35 kD) GAPDH (35 kD)\n\nFLAG-USP1\nDAOY\n\nFLAG-US37C350S\n\nFLAG-US37WT\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n-\n-\n\n- -\n-\n\n-\n\n293T (In vitro)\n\nHA-Ub-p27\n\nNEM\n\nFLAG-USP1\n\nFLAG-US37WT\n\nFLAG-US37C350S\n\nUb-p27\n(27-250kD)\n\np27 (27 kD)\n\nUSP37 (120 kD)\n\nGAPDH (35 kD)\n\n+ + + + +\n+ +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n\n- - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\np27 (27 kD)\n\nUSP37 (120 kD)USP37 (120 kD)\n\np27 (27 kD)\n\np27\n(27-250kD)\n\np27\n(27-250kD)\n\n0\n20000\n40000\n60000\n80000\n\n100000\n120000\n140000\n160000\n180000\n200000\n\nUT 6h 12h 18h 24h\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n U\n\nS\nP\n\n3\n7\n G\n\ne\nn\n\ne\nE\n\nx\np\n\nre\ns\ns\nio\n\nn\n \n\nTime Post-transfection \n\nFLAG-US37C350SFLAG-US37WT\nTime (H) UT 6 12 18\n\n+ + +-\nTime (H) UT 6 12 18\n\n+ + +-\n\np27\n(27-250kD)\n\nUSP37 (120 kD)\n\nUSP37 WT - - + +\n\nDAOY \n\na\nn\n\nti\n-p\n\n2\n7\n\nIg\nG\n\nIg\nG\n\na\nn\n\nti\n-p\n\n2\n7\n\nFigure 5.

Collectively, these data indicate\nthat p27 ubiquitination and stability in medulloblastoma cells is\ncontrolled by USP37.\n\nREST-induced cell proliferation and blockade of neuronal gene\nexpression is dependent on USP37\nTo examine the effect of USP37-dependent stabilization of p27 on\nproliferation and differentiation of medulloblastoma cells, we\ntransfected DAOY cells with pDEST26 vector alone or pDEST26-\nexpressing USP37WT or USP37C350-S. Cells were stained with anti-\nKi67 antibodies and studied by IFA. Percentage change in the\nnumber of Ki-67-positive cells in USP37WT or USP37C350-S-expres-\nsing cells was measured and plotted relative to vector-transfected\ncontrols (set to 100%; Figure 6a). Only 10% of cells expressing\nUSP37WTwere Ki-67-positive in contrast to 70% Ki-67 positivity in\nUSP37C350-S-expressing cells (Figure 6a). Unexpectedly, qRT\u2013PCR\nanalyses showed that WT USP37 expression promoted a 2.7\u20138-fold\nincrease in expression of the REST target genes Syn1, brain-derived\nneurotrophic growth factor (BDNF) and superior cervical ganglion-10\n(SCG10), respectively, relative to vector-transfected cells. A 1.2\u20132-\nfold upregulation of these genes was seen in cells expressing\nUSP37C350-S (Figure 6b). These findings indicate that ectopic USP37\n\nnot only blocked REST-dependent cell proliferation, but also\ncountered the blockade to neuronal differentiation even in the\npresence of REST.\nTo examine if REST-induced p27 stabilization and maintenance\n\nof cell proliferation required USP37, we transiently knocked down\nREST gene expression alone or REST and USP37 gene expression\ntogether in DAOY cells and studied its effect on p27 stabilization\nand cell numbers. Cells transfected with USP37 siRNA or scrambled\nsiRNA were included as controls. Knockdown efficiency was\nmeasured by qRT\u2013PCR analyses (Figure 6c). As seen in Figures\n6d and e, REST loss promoted p27 protein stabilization whereas\nthe concomitant loss of USP37 countered this effect. This also\ncountered the decrease in cell numbers that was observed in cells\nlacking REST gene expression. Thus, our data suggest that REST-\nmediated destabilization of p27 and deregulation of proliferation\nare mediated by USP37.\n\nDISCUSSION\nREST is expressed in embryonic stem cells, non-neural cells and\nneural progenitors, where it prevents neuronal differentiation.1\u201310\n\nHowever, recent work from a number of groups, including our\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nC\ne\nll\n N\n\nu\nm\n\nb\ne\nr \n\n(%\n)\n\nsiRNA scr REST\n+\n\nUSP37\n\nREST USP37\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n G\n\ne\nn\n\ne\n E\n\nx\np\n\nre\ns\ns\nio\n\nn\n REST\n\nUSP37\n\nsiRNA scr REST USP37\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n K\n\ni-\n6\n7\n P\n\no\ns\nit\n\niv\ne\n\nC\ne\nll\ns\n (\n\n%\n) \n\nVe\nct\n\nor\n\nVe\nct\n\nor\n\nFL\nAG\n\n-U\nS3\n\n7\nC3\n\n50\nS\n\nFL\nAG\n\n-U\nS3\n\n7\nC3\n\n50\nS\n\nFL\nAG\n\n-U\nS3\n\n7\nW\n\nT\n\nFL\nAG\n\n-U\nS3\n\n7\nW\n\nT\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\nSynapsin\nBDNF\nSCG10\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n G\n\ne\nn\n\ne\n E\n\nx\np\n\nre\ns\ns\nio\n\nn\n\nsiUSP37\n\n+ -\nsiREST\n\nscr - -\n+ + --\n\n- + +-\n\nACTIN (50 kD)\n\np27 (27 kD)\n\np27\n(27-250kD)\n\nREST\n+\n\nUSP37\n\nFigure 6.

Although the levels of known p27-specific E3-\nligases (Skp2, KPC1/KPC2) were unaltered in our assays, we cannot\nrule out a change in the activity of these enzymes at this time. In\naddition, it is important to note that the introduction of a\nconserved cysteine residue in USP37 may have caused a change in\nprotein folding and promoted its inactivation. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first report of a DUB involved in p27 regulation in neural\ncells.22 The involvement of USP37 in cell proliferation suggested\nby our data is supported by a previous report in the literature by\nHuang et al.57 This excellent study showed USP37 to be important\nfor deubiquitylation of cyclin A and in S phase progression in 293T\ncells.57 However, we observed an USP37-dependent decrease in\n\ncell proliferation in neural cells. In addition, whereas USP37\nexpression was found to be controlled by E2F and also subject to\nan autoregulatory loop in the study by Huang et al.,57 we showed\nit to be controlled by REST in neural cells. Whether these opposing\neffects on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression is a\nreflection of fundamental differences in the regulation and\nfunction of USP37 and or its target specificity in neural and non-\nneural cells is not clear at this time. In this context, it is important\nto note that REST has tumor suppressive and oncogenic functions\nin non-neural and neural cells, respectively.12\u201314,43,58\u201361 A future\nline of investigation would be to assess the role of REST, if any, in\nthe control of USP37 expression in non-neural cells. If so, it would\nbe important to also examine its connection to E2F-dependent\nregulation of USP37.\nIn conclusion, our study has uncovered a novel role for REST\n\nand USP37 in the regulation of p27 protein and cell proliferation,\nalthough a transcriptional regulation of p27 by REST cannot be\nruled out. These findings add to a growing body of literature\nimplicating DUBs in cell cycle control.62\u201369 Our data suggest that\nREST could potentially function as a molecular switch that\ntemporally coordinates cell proliferation with blockade of\nneurogenesis (Figure 7). This possibility needs to be evaluated in\nmouse models. The contribution of REST-USP37-p27 pathway to\nthe development of neural tumors such as medulloblastoma is\nunclear and is a subject of ongoing investigation in our laboratory.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell culture\nHuman medulloblastoma cell lines DAOY and D283 were obtained from\nthe American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and were\nmaintained as described previously.70 Primary cultures MB-003, MB-020,\nMB-0110, UW426 and UW228 were a kind gift of Drs James Olson,\nLaurence Cooper and John Silber.\n\nTransient transfection\nDAOY and D283 cells were transiently transfected with On-Target plus\nSmart pool duplex siRNA against human and mouse REST, human USP37 or\nOn-Target plus si-control non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO,\nUSA) using DharmaFect transfection reagent. Briefly, cells were grown\novernight in antibiotic-free, serum containing medium and transfected\nwith 100 nM REST-specific siRNA, USP37-specific siRNA or both siRNAs, and\nnon-target scr siRNA and incubated for 24 h at 37 1C and 5% CO2. DAOY\ncells were also transiently transfected with the following plasmids:\npDEST26-FLAG-HA-USP37WT, USP37C350-S, FLAG-HA-USP1, pcDNA3-myc3-\np27 or HA-Ub (Addgene, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA). Cell numbers and\nviability were assessed by trypan blue staining.\n\nFlow cytometry\nDAOY cells transfected with pooled siRNA against REST or control siRNA\nwere resuspended in a solution containing 1mg/ml sodium citrate, 0.1%\nTriton-X-100 and 0.05mg/ml propidium iodide and incubated overnight at\n4 1C. Stained cells were analyzed using a Becton-Dickinson FacsScan Flow\nCytometer (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and the numbers of cells with sub-G1,\nG1, S or G2/M DNA content were calculated using CellQuest 3.2 software\n(BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\nqRT\u2013PCR analyses\nRNA was isolated from DAOY and D283 cells transfected with various\npooled siRNAs or wild-type and mutant USP37C350-S using the RNeasy kit\n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). qRT\u2013PCR reactions were performed as\ndescribed previously using primers for human REST, USP37, Syn1, BDNF\nor SCG10.70 Reactions were performed in triplicate and gene expression\nwas normalized to actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAPDH)\ndehydrogenase or 18S RNA. Relative mRNA expression was calculated\nusing the comparative DDct method.71\n\nThe following primer sequences were used:\nBrain-derived neurotrophic growth factor\nForward: 50-GCC CTG TAT CAA CCC AGA AA-30\n\nReverse: 50-CTT CAG AGG CCT TCG TTT TG-30\n\nUSP37P27\n\nTUBIII, Syn,\nGluR2\n\nDifferentiation\n\nREST\n\nProliferation\nREST\n\nP27 P27-Ub\nProteasomal\nDegradation\n\nUSP37\n\nE3-Ligase \n\nFigure 7. Model to describe novel roles for REST and USP37 in the\ncontrol of p27 levels and cell proliferation. (a) REST is a known\nregulator of neuronal differentiation genes in neural progenitors\nand medulloblastoma cells. Here, we show that REST also promotes\ncell proliferation by repressing USP37 expression and causing\np27 degradation. (b) USP37 promotes p27 deubiquitination and\nprevents its proteasomal degradation, a process that is negatively\nregulated by REST.\n\nREST promotes p27 destabilization\nCM Das et al\n\n1698\n\nOncogene (2013) 1691 \u2013 1701 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited\n\n\n\nSCG10\nForward: 50-GAG CTG TCC ATG CTG TCA CTG-30\n\nReverse: 50-GAA GAA ACT GGA GGC TGC AGA-30\n\nSyn1\nForward: 50-GTC TGA CAG ATA CAA GCT CTG-30\n\nReverse: 50- GAC CAC GAG CTC TAC GAT GAG-30\n\nREST\nForward: 50-GTA GGA GCA GAA GAG GCA GAT-30\n\nReverse: 50- GCT TCA CGT TCT TCT ACT GCT-30\n\nUSP37\nForward: 50-GTG CTC TTG TCA GGC ACA AA-30\n\nReverse: 50-GCA CTC CAA CCA AGG GTA AA-30\n\nWestern blotting\nDAOY, D283 and UW228 were treated with 100mg/ml cycloheximide\n(Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) or 20mM MG132 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA).\nExtracts prepared from these cells or those transfected with expression\nconstructs and siRNAs cells were subjected to polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis and western blotting using one or more of the following\nprimary antibodies: REST (Millipore, Waltham, MA, USA); p27 (BD\nBiosciences, San Jose, CA, USA and Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA);\nUSP37 (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA); Ub (Abcam, Cam-\nbridge, MA, USA); type-III b tubulin (Covance, Emeryville, CA, USA); actin\n(Cell Signaling); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam); and\nN-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).\n\nChromatin IP assay\nCross-linked DAOY cells were resuspended in sonication buffer (50mM\nTris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 10mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and\nprotease inhibitors) and sonicated and 10% of this material was saved as\ninput DNA. The reminder of the samples were diluted 10-fold with IP buffer\n(16.7mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 167mM NaCl, 1.2mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1.1% Triton\nX-100 and protease inhibitors), precleared and incubated with anti-REST\nantibody or control non-immune sera for 12 h at 4 1C. Following incubation\nwith protein A beads, washing and elution, the cross-linking was reversed\nand DNA was purified with a QiaQuick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). The\nbound DNA was quantified by SYBR-Green qPCR analyses and analyzed\nusing an IQ5 RT\u2013PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,\nUSA). Calculations following normalization to input values were done as\ndescribed previously.72 The following primers were used:\nHuman USP37\nForward: 50-CAT CTC ACT CAG GCA GGA AAG TTG TGC-30\n\nReverse: 50-GGA CCA GGC TTC ACA GGT GAT AGG AG-30\n\nHuman Syn1\nAs described in Lawinger et al.12\n\nIP and co-IP assay\nCells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 150mM\nNaCl, 1mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Igepal and protease\ninhibitors) and sonicated. Protein (1mg) in lysis buffer was pre-cleared and\nincubated with anti-p27 or anti-Ub antibody (Abcam) overnight at 4 1C and\nthen incubated with protein-G agarose. Beads were washed and sample\nwas eluted with 2X sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer and analyzed by western\nblotting using anti-p27 or anti-Ub antibody.\n\nIFA and hematoxylin-eosin staining\nDe-identified patient samples and normal cerebella were obtained\nfollowing Institutional Review Board approval. Samples were deparaffi-\nnized and processed for IFA using antibodies against REST (1:50, Millipore),\np27 (1:100, BD Biosciences) and USP37 (1:150, Bethyl Laboratories). After\nwashing, cells were incubated with Cy3- or Alexa 488-conjugated\nsecondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then covered\nwith Slowfade Gold antifade (Invitrogen) containing 1mg/ml Hoechst dye\nto stain the nuclei. Images were visualized under a Nikon fluorescence\nmicroscope (Nikon Inc, Melville, NY, USA) and analyzed using Metamorph\nsoftware (Molecular Devices, Downington, PA, USA). Staining for REST, p27\nand USP37 expression was scored as high (\u00fe \u00fe \u00fe \u00fe /\u00fe \u00fe \u00fe ), moderate\n(\u00fe \u00fe ), low (\u00fe ) or none (\ufffd ). Hematoxylin-eosin staining and co-staining\nfor REST and p27 were performed as described previously.13,70 Brains were\nharvested from postnatal day 7 mice and processed for IFA using anti-p27\nand anti-USP37 antibodies.\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis\nThe plasmid pDEST26-Flag-HA-USP37 expressing the human USP37 gene\n(Addgene, Inc.) was used as a template to perform a site-directed change\nof the conserved cysteine at position 350 to a serine using QuikChange II\nXL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Invitrogen). The following primers were\nused: 50-GGG CTT CTC CAA TTT GGG AAA TAC CTC CTA TAT GAA TGC-30 and\n50-GCA TTC ATA TAG GAG GTA TTT CCC AAA TTG GAG AAG CCC TGC-30 .\nIntroduction of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing.\n\nIn vivo deubiquitination assay\nDAOY cells were transfected with pDEST26 vector-expressing Flag-HA-\nUSP37WT, Flag-HA-USP37C350-S or Flag-HA-USP1 (Addgene, Inc.). Cell extracts\nwere prepared after addition of MG132 (20mM) to the culture medium for a\nperiod of 6 h before harvesting the cells. Cell lysates were subjected to\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting using anti-p27,\nanti-REST, anti-USP37 and anti-GAPDH antibodies.\n\nIn vitro deubiquitination assay\n293T cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3-myc3-p27 and HA-Ub or with\npDEST26-FLAG-HA-USP37WT, FLAG-HA-USP37C350-S or FLAG-HA-USP1 using\nLipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were treated with 20mM MG132\nfor 6h before collection and lysed in IP buffer. Cell extracts from DUB-\nexpressing cells (1mg protein) were immunopurified using anti-FLAG M2\nbeads and eluted with FLAG peptide. HA-Ub-Myc-p27 substrate was\npurified from cell extracts (1mg protein) using anti EZview red anti-HA\naffinity gel and elution with HA-peptide. DUB assays were performed\nby incubating equal amount of substrate with purified DUBs (USP37,\nUSP37C350-S or USP1) in the presence or absence of 15mM N-ethyl\nmaleimide57). Reactions were terminated by adding 6X Laemmli buffer and\nreactants were analyzed by western blotting with anti-p27 and anti-Ub\nantibodies.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants from the American Cancer Center (RSG-09-273-\n01-DDC) and the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\n(1R03NS077021) to VG.\n\nREFERENCES\n1 Chong JA, Tapia-Ramirez J, Kim S, Toledo-Aral JJ, Zheng Y, Boutros MC et al.
