Previously, we reported a marked increase in Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD functional activity in human dermal psoriatic\nfibroblasts. As retinoic acid (RA) has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and a mechanism for its beneficial effects is not\n\nunderstood, we investigated the effects of RA on SOD mRNA and protein expression levels in human normal and psoriatic\nfibroblasts. Prior to RA exposure, Cu,Zn-SOD protein and mRNA levels were similar in normal compared to psoriatic fibroblasts\nwhile Mn-SOD protein and mRNA levels were increased in psoriatic cells. However, in contrast to normal fibroblasts, exposure of\n\npsoriatic fibroblasts to 1 mM RA down-regulated Mn-SOD mRNA, and also decreased Mn-SOD activity by w80% with no change\nin Mn-SOD protein levels. In contrast, Cu,Zn-SOD protein and enzymatic activity were modestly reduced by RA treatment in both\nnormal and psoriatic fibroblasts. Furthermore, RA treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts also caused a decrease in Cu,Zn-SOD steady-\n\nstate mRNA levels. These results indicate that RA can serve as a regulatory agent to down-regulate the steady-state levels of both\nMn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD in psoriatic cells. These findings offer a new model for the antiinflammatory activity of RA when used in\nthe treatment of psoriasis.\n\n\ufffd 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nStudies to define the role of superoxide radicals (O2\nc\ufffd)\n\nin both physiological and pathological processes are an\narea of active investigation. Reactive oxygen species\n(ROS), including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide\nradicals and hydroxyl radicals are generated in cells in\nresponse to stimulation by various hormones, growth\nfactors and cytokines [1], such as PDGF [2,3]. The\n\nmailto:raynaud@vjf.cnrs.fr\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/08968411\n\n\n70 P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78\noxygen radicals generated appear to act as second\nmessengers in transmembrane signaling pathways and\nmodulate cellular functions such as cell proliferation,\ndifferentiation, and apoptosis [3]. Oxidative regulation\nof several key enzymes involved in cellular signal\ntransduction, including protein kinases, has been de-\nscribed [4].\n\nOxidants also have been implicated in a number of\npathological disorders, including Alzheimer disease,\npsoriasis, aging, atherosclerosis, and cancer [5e8]. The\nprimary cellular defenses against damage that can be\ncaused by O2\n\nc\ufffd and by its reactive progeny are the\nsuperoxide dismutases (SODs). Mammalian cells have\na mitochondrial Mn-SOD, a cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD\n(also found in peroxysomes) and an extracellular SOD\nwhich is a Cu,Zn-SOD that is immunologically distinct\nfrom the classical Cu,Zn-SOD [9]. These metalloen-\nzymes act to dismute toxic superoxide radicals to oxygen\nand H2O2[9e11]. Catalase, along with peroxidases such\nas glutathione peroxide, in turn catalyze the decompo-\nsition of H2O2 to water and oxygen. Studies have been\nongoing for a number of years in our laboratories on the\nsynergism between retinoic acid and cyclic AMP that\nregulates cell growth and differentiation [12]. In the\ncourse of these studies, it was established that cyclic\nAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity, as well\nas 8-azido-[\n\n32\nP] cAMP binding to the RI and RII\n\nregulatory subunits, are decreased in cells of psoriatic\npatients compared to cells of normal subjects [13]. More\nrecent studies determined that exposure of normal\nhuman dermal fibroblasts to H2O2 and to other oxygen\nfree radical generating systems decreased both PKA\nactivity and cyclic AMP binding to RI and RII, to levels\nsimilar to those observed with psoriatic fibroblasts [14].\nTreatment of psoriatic fibroblasts with free radical\nscavenging agents restored the ability of RI and RII to\nbind cyclic AMP toward normal levels. We also showed\nthat SOD activity, particularly that of the mitochondrial\nenzyme, Mn-SOD, was elevated in fibroblasts prepared\nfrom a psoriatic patient [15]. These results suggested\nthat oxidative modification may serve as a mechanism to\nalter PKA in human cells, and that an altered oxidative\nstate may be responsible for the decrease in PKA\nactivity and cyclic AMP binding in cells from psoriatic\npatients.\n\nRetinoic acid derivatives have been used with some\nsuccess in the therapeutic treatment of psoriasis even\nthough the mechanism of retinoid action responsible for\nthis beneficial effect was not known [16,17]. Previously,\nwe established that the treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts\nwith retinoic acid and with other retinoids, such as 13-\ncis-retinoic acid and arotinoid induced an increase in the\noxidatively modified PKA activity back towards normal\nlevels [13]. Again however, the mechanism by which\nretinoic acid acted to increase PKA activity in psoriatic\ncells remained to be elucidated. Thus, the present studies\nwere carried out to determine if retinoic acid treatment\nmight differentially regulate antioxidant enzyme activi-\nties in normal and psoriatic fibroblasts. To address this\nquestion Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD functional activi-\nties, as well as Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA levels\nand protein levels, were determined in cells in the\npresence and absence of retinoic acid. Retinoid treat-\nment of psoriatic fibroblasts was observed to signifi-\ncantly decrease both Mn-SOD activity and steady-state\nmRNA levels as well as both Cu,Zn-SOD expression\nand enzymatic activity.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Experimental reagents\n\nRetinoic acid (RA) and actinomycin D (ActD) were\nobtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MI, USA) and\ncycloheximide was purchased from Calbiochem (La\nJolla, CA, USA). ActD was dissolved in dimethylsulf-\noxide (Me2SO). RA was dissolved in 100% ethanol and\ncycloheximide in double distilled water (ddH2O).\nDMEM with L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, fetal\nbovine serum and antibiotics were obtained from\nInvitrogen. The antibody to b-actin was an anti-mouse\nmonoclonal antibody purchased from Sigma. The rabbit\nanti-human Mn-SOD antibody and the goat anti-\nhuman Cu,Zn-SOD antibody were gifts of Dr\nN. Taniguchi, Osaka, Japan. The horseradish peroxi-\ndase-labelled secondary antibody was obtained from\nJackson Immunoresearch. Protein assay reagents and\npolyvinylidene difluoride membranes were purchased\nfrom Bio-Rad (Marnes la Coquette, France).\n\n2.2. Cells\n\nHuman fibroblasts were isolated from seven normal\nand seven untreated adult psoriatic patients (Psoriasis\nvulgaris in flare for approximately 3 months) by\nenzymatic digestion of small pieces (4 mm) of lesional\nand non-lesional buttock and abdominal skin punch\nbiopsies as previously described [14,18]. These Caucasian\nsubjects were age- and sex-matched. This study was\napproved by the ethical committee of the Ho\u0302pital Cochin\n(Paris). The patients had received no systemic therapy\nsuch as corticosteroids, antimitotic drugs, retinoids for\nat least a year before the study; no systemic anti-\ninflammatory drugs for at least two weeks before the\nbiopsy; no local corticosteroids, ultraviolet light, or oral\npsoralen for at least three months before the assay. The\nseverity of the disease was determined by mean psoriatic\narea and severity index (PASI)score, as described by\nFrederiksson and Peterssonn [45]. The PASI score for\nthe 10 patients were 22.54G0.47 (Range 12.8e34.1).\nCells were grown as previously described [14] and used\n\n\n\n71P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78\nsubconfluent (10\n6\ncells/dish) at the fifth passage. All data\n\nwere obtained with cells propagated for the same number\nof passages (fifth passage) under identical culture\nconditions. For each donor the different assays were\nperformed on the same cell extracts prepared from cells\narising from the same cell seeding.\n\n2.3. Preparation of cellular fractions\n\nFibroblasts were washed three times with ice cold\nphosphate buffered saline and harvested by scraping\ninto ice cold buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2,\n20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) with a cell scraper with anti-\nproteolytics. The cells were recovered by centrifugation\nat 1000g for 5 min and the cell pellet was then frozen at\n\ufffd80 \ufffdC. For antioxidant enzyme activity measurements,\nthe control and psoriatic cell pellets were disrupted by\nsonication in 500 ml of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer,\npH 7, (whole cell lysates), and the same cellular sample\nwas used to assay each of the indicated activities within\nthe same experiment.\n\n2.4. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities\n\nAs previously described [15], xanthineexanthine\noxidase was used to generate an O2\n\nc\ufffd flux and the\nreduction of 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenol)-5 phe-\nnyltetrazolium chloride (INT) to red formazan by O2\n\nc\ufffd\n\nwas followed at 505 nm, 30 \ufffdC. Each assay tube\ncontained 50 mM (3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propane-sul-\nfonic acid) (CAPS) buffer, pH 10.2, for determination of\nCu,Zn-SOD activity [19], or 50 mM phosphate buffer,\npH 7.8, for determination of total SOD activity [20],\nalong with 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM INT, 50 mM xanthine,\n1 U/ml catalase, 0.05 mM bathocuproin disulfonate\ndisodium salt (BCS), 0.13 mg/ml bovine serum albumin\n(BSA), and enough xanthine oxidase to achieve the\nrequired 100% of non-inhibition. BCS and BSA were\nadded to inhibit non-enzymatic scavenging of O2\n\nc\ufffd. Mn-\nSOD activity was determined by adding cyanide (2 mM)\nto the assay mixture at pH 7.8 to inhibit Cu,Zn-SOD\nactivity, or was determined by subtracting the Cu,Zn-\nSOD activity determined at pH 10.2 from the total SOD\nactivity measured at pH 7.8. The two methods gave\nsimilar values (data not shown). All data are expressed\nin units of SOD activity per mg of protein.\n\n2.5. Western blot analysis\n\nCell pellets were prepared as described above. Then\ncell lysates were prepared, protein levels were de-\ntermined and the lysates were then heated for 5 min at\n95 \ufffdC in Laemmli sample buffer and analysed by\nelectrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels (10 mg/\nsample). Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellu-\nlose and Western blots were performed as described in\nthe Supersignal kit (Pierce, Bezons, France). The SOD\nproteins were detected with a rabbit anti-human Mn-\nSOD antibody and a goat anti-human Cu,Zn-SOD\nantibody, both diluted 1000-fold (gift of Dr Taniguchi\nN., Osaka, Japan).\n\n2.6. Actinomycin D treatment\n\nTo determine the stability of Cu,Zn- and Mn-SOD\nmRNA, with or without retinoic acid (1 mM), the three\ndifferent types (normal, non-lesional and lesional\npsoriatic) of human fibroblast primary cultures were\nuntreated or treated for 48 h with 1 mM RA, and then\n10 mg/ml ActD was added. Cells were collected, and\ntotal RNA was isolated at the indicated time points.\n\n2.7. Cycloheximide treatment\n\nTo inhibit protein synthesis, cells were incubated with\n10 mg/ml cycloheximide, with or without retinoic acid\ntreatment (1 mM) for 48 h. To determine the turn over of\nCu,Zn- and Mn-SOD protein, cells were collected from\nthe three different types of human fibroblasts primary\ncultures at the indicated time for western blot analysis.\n\n2.8. RNA isolation and real time RT-PCR\n\nTotal RNA was extracted with RNA-Plus (Qbiogene,\nIllkirch, France) from normal (N, Normal Skin),\nlesional (LP, Lesional Psoriatic Skin) and non-lesional\n(nLP, non-Lesional Psoriatic Skin) cultured fibroblasts,\nand 1 mg of each sample was reverse-transcribed into\ncDNA using a first-strand cDNA-synthesis kit (Amer-\nsham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).\n\nReal-time quantitative PCR was conducted with the\nTaqMan system (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) for\nthe Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD steady state mRNA\nlevels with or without RA treatment or the LightCycler\nsystem for the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD mRNA\nstability (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)\nusing the DNA-binding dye SYBR Green for the\ndetection of PCR products according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed in\na total volume of 20 ml in the presence of 2 ml of cDNA,\n2 ml of 10! LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I,\n1.25 mM MgCl2, 25 pmol of both primers. After de-\nnaturation at 95 \ufffdC for 10 min, the samples underwent\n40 cycles of amplification (15 s at 95 \ufffdC; 5 s at 60 \ufffdC and\n8 s at 72 \ufffdC). Sense and antisense primers were re-\nspectively: 5#-GGC GAC CTG GAA GTC CAA CT-3#\nand 5#-CCA TCA GCA CCA CAG CCT TC-3# for PO;\n5#-CTG AAG GCC TGC ATG GAT TC-3# and 5#-\nCCA AGT CTC CAA CAT GCC TCT C-3# for Cu,Zn-\nSOD; 5#-CGT GAC TTT GGT TCC TTT GAC A-3#\nand 5#-AAG TGT CCC CGT TCC TTA TTG A-3# for\nMn-SOD. Experiments were performed with duplicates\n\n\n\n72 P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78\nfor each point, and all results were normalized to P0\n(RPLP0, human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein)\ncDNA detected in the same sample.\n\n2.9. Analysis of statistical significance\n\nData were analysed by the ANOVA test.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Retinoic acid treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts\ndecreased SOD enzymatic activities\n\nIn agreement with our previous findings [15], both\nnon-lesional (nLP) and lesional (LP) psoriatic fibroblasts\nexhibit significantly higher levels of Mn-SOD and\nCu,Zn-SOD activities compared to normal (N) fibro-\nblasts (Table 1). Treatment with 1 mM RA for 4 days\ndecreased the Cu,Zn-SOD activity determined in all\nthree cell types by 18% ( p! 0.005), 26% ( p! 0.005),\nand 23% ( p! 0.025) for normal, nLP, and LP\nfibroblasts, respectively. Interestingly, the Mn-SOD\nactivity was dramatically decreased by 1 mM RA\ntreatment for 4 days in psoriatic fibroblasts and returned\nto levels equivalent to that in normal firbroblasts (83%\nand 78% decrease in nLP and LP psoriatic fibroblasts,\nrespectively, p! 0.005), whereas RA had no effect on\nMn-SOD activity in normal fibroblasts (Table 1).\n\n3.2. Time dependency of decreased SOD enzymatic\nactivities upon retinoic acid treatment\n\nThe effects of treating cells with RA for increasing\nperiods of time on Cu,Zn-SOD (panel A) and Mn-SOD\n(panel B) activities are depicted in Fig. 1. RA treatment\nof nLP, LP and normal fibroblasts showed only a slight\neffect on Cu,Zn-SOD activity through 3 h. However,\na decrease in Cu,Zn-SOD activity was observed in all\nthree cell types at 96 h of treatment with RA, which was\nmaximal at 18 h (Fig. 1A). Importantly, RA had little\neffect on the low basal level Mn-SOD activity present in\nnormal fibroblasts through 96 h of treatment, while\ntreatment of both nLP and LP psoriatic fibroblasts with\nRA for 3 h resulted in a dramatic decrease in Mn-SOD\nactivity (Fig. 1B). This decrease in Mn-SOD activity in\nresponse to RA treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts was\nmaintained through 96 h. At this time, the Mn-SOD\nactivity of psoriatic cells was similar to its basal level\ndetermined in normal fibroblasts.\n\n3.3. Retinoic acid effects on Cu,Zn-SOD\nand Mn-SOD protein levels\n\nThe protein levels of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD\npresent in control and RA-treated cells were analysed by\nwestern blot and densitometric scanning of the auto-\nradiographs (Fig. 2). Exposure to RA was found to\nreduce the level of Cu,Zn-SOD protein in both normal\nand psoriatic fibroblasts from 18 h through 96 h of\ntreatment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no alteration in the\nlevel of Mn-SOD protein was observed in any of the cell\ntypes through 96 h of treatment with RA (Fig. 2B).\n\nIn another set of experiments, cells were treated for\n18 h and 96 h. While the Mn-SOD protein level was not\nchanged by RA treatment of either normal or psoriatic\nfibroblasts (Fig. 2D), RA treatment did result in\ndecreased levels of Cu,Zn-SOD protein in all three\ndifferent human primary cell types (nZ 4 of each\nprimary cultures, Fig. 2C). Thus, in comparison with\nuntreated cells, the mean valuesG SEM of Cu,Zn-SOD\nprotein levels were decreased by 17%G 4 ( p! 0.02),\n19%G 2 ( p! 0.05) and 27%G 8 ( p! 0.03) in nor-\nmal, nLP and LP RA-treated cells, respectively.\n\n3.4.

As determined by real time RT-PCR,\nthe steady-state levels of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA found in\npsoriatic cells were significantly decreased in response to\nRA treatment for 96 h (nLP 0Z 4.85 AUG 1.339, nLP\nRAZ 3.07 AUG 0.21, p! 0.03 nZ 4; LP 0Z 3.56\nAUG 0.57, LP RAZ 2.52 AUG 0.44, p! 0.015\nnZ 5; N 0Z 4.22 AUG 0.44, N RAZ 3.27G 0.85\nnZ 4).

Discussion\n\nThe involvement of oxygen free radicals in a growing\nlist of diseases indicates a need for pharmaceutical agents\nthat may inhibit the production of free radicals. These\nmolecules may enhance radical scavenging systems,\nwhich may then reverse oxidative damage to important\ncellular components including those of the signal trans-\nduction pathways. All-trans retinoic acid (RA), the\nactive metabolite of vitamin A, is critical in the\nregulation of a number of biological processes, including\nembryogenesis and cell growth [22,23] and it also has\nbeen used in the treatment of psoriasis [24]. Previous\nresults, which demonstrated that RA treatment of cells\ncould reverse the oxidatively modified state of protein\nkinase C [25], and of PKA [14], indicated that RA might\nact to alter redox activities within the cell. However, its\nmechanism of action is still unclear. To assess the role of\nRA as an important regulator for treatment of psoriasis,\nwe have investigated the effects of RA on Cu,Zn-SOD\nand Mn-SOD activity as well as mRNA and protein\nlevels in normal and psoriatic fibroblasts.\n\nRetinoic acid treatment of psoriatic (nLP and\nLP) fibroblasts produced a significant, time-dependent\ndecrease in Mn-SOD activity and mRNA to the basal\nlevels observed in normal fibroblasts. As increased Mn-\nSOD activity occurs in response to an oxidative stress\nand particularly in response to superoxide anions, the\nantioxidant effects of RA treatment results in a reduction\nof Mn-SOD activity in the psoriatic cells to basal levels.\nInterestingly, the amount of Mn-SOD protein found in\nthese cells was not modified by RA treatment. However,\ndiscrepancies between mRNA and protein levels have\nalso been reported by others. Ahlemeyer et al. [26]\nshowed that staurosporine did not influence the mRNA\nlevels of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD, but decreased the\nprotein levels and the activity of both enzymes in\ncultures from neonatal rat hippocampus. Tsan et al. [27]\n\n\n\n76 P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78\nshowed that hyperoxia-induced increase in the mRNA\nlevel of Mn-SOD in the lung was not associated with an\nincrease in the protein level or enzymatic activity of Mn-\nSOD. Niu et al. [28] found an induction of the Mn-SOD\nmRNA by lipopolysaccharides in rat astrocytes, with\na constant Mn-SOD protein level. These observations\nsuggest that SOD protein levels could be dissociated\nfrom their synthesis and from their enzyme activities.\nThe fact that RA decreases mRNA levels of Mn-SOD in\npsoriatic fibroblasts without a significant decrease in\nprotein levels could be explained by the stability of these\nenzymes in time course of our experiments. Our results\nare in agreement with a 5e6 h half-life for Mn-SOD\n[29]. It is also possible that the RA treatment has altered\nthe subcellular distribution of the protein. For example,\nif the RA treatment enhanced protein transport into the\nlysozome or proteosome through post-translational\nmodifications such as ubiqutination, it is possible that\nwhile total cellular protein levels were not changed, the\nenzymatic activity was reduced due to the change in\nsubcellular localization. This hypothesis awaits further\ninvestigation.\n\nEnzyme activities often are modulated by post-\ntranslational modification of the protein. Covalent\nmodifications such as disulfide formation, phosphoryla-\ntion, acetylation, glycosylation and nitration all have\nbeen reported [30]. An additional modification termed\nretinoylation also has been observed in cells treated with\nretinoic acid [31,32]. Following activation of retinoic\nacid in a coenzyme A-mediated reaction, a thioester\nbond between protein and RA can be created. The RI\nand RII regulatory subunits of PKA were found to be\nretinoylated in HL 60 cells [32], and we also observed\nretinoylation of RI and RII in normal and psoriatic\nfibroblasts [33]. Retinoylation of the RII regulatory\nsubunit, as well as total protein retinoylation, was\nobserved to be increased in psoriatic cells. This raises the\npossibility that Mn-SOD could be covalently modified\nby retinoylation in response to RA treatment of\npsoriatic cells, thus explaining our observed decrease\nin enzyme activity. Finally we recently have shown an\nincrease of carbonylation in psoriatic cells, which could\nalso be responsible for protein modification and de-\ncreased enzyme activity [34].\n\nRetinoic acid treatment had a differential effect on\nthe modulation of Cu,Zn-SOD. The basal level of\nCu,Zn-SOD mRNA was not significantly altered in\npsoriatic as compared to normal fibroblasts, whereas\nthe basal Mn-SOD mRNA level was significantly\nelevated in psoriatic fibroblasts. In studies with\npsoriatic epidermis, Lo\u0308ntz et al. [35] reported that the\nexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA was unchanged in\npsoriatic (nLP and LP) compared to normal skin. In\nour case, we have determined that retinoic acid\ntreatment resulted in decreased levels of Cu,Zn-SOD\nmRNA in psoriatic cells. However, the mechanism(s)\nunderlying the down-regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD expres-\nsion remains unclear. In fact, there is little information\nconcerning factors which may regulate Cu,Zn-SOD\ntranscription, as Cu,Zn-SOD is constitutively expressed\nin primary cultures of dermal fibroblasts, and is not\nregulated by cytokines and growth factors [36]. Re-\ncently, Frank et al. [37] showed a direct coupling of\nCu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression levels to the presence\nof nitric oxide, since Cu,Zn-SOD levels declined during\nacute inflammation (endotoxemic shock) in the pres-\nence of a selective inhibitor of iNOS and without\ninvolvement of the soluble guanylate cyclase. This\nsuggested the possibility that under conditions of\nchronic inflammation, such as in psoriatic fibroblasts,\nCu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression might be regulated by\nH2O2, NO and peroxinitrite.\n\nResults presented here showed that RA treatment of\npsoriatic fibroblasts for 18 h down-regulated Cu,Zn-\nSOD mRNA steady-state levels. These results suggest\neither transcriptional regulation or a modification of\nmRNA stability of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression with\nRA treatment of psoriatic cells, but a translational\nregulation of Cu,Zn-SOD levels in normal cells.\nRetinoids appear to exert their biological effects through\nmultiple gene regulatory nuclear factors [38e40]. An\nactivated retinoidereceptor complex can regulate gene\nexpression by two distinct mechanisms. It can activate\ntranscription by binding to a retinoid response element\nin the promoter of specific genes. However, no retinoid\nresponse element was found within the promoter regions\nof the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD genes. Alternatively,\nRA can indirectly repress the activity of other nuclear\ntranscription factors such as AP-1 [41,42]. The activated\nretinoid receptor complex can interact with cofactor\nproteins that are required for AP-1 mediated gene\ntranscription factor. However, no binding sequence for\nthe AP-1 transcription factor has been found within the\nproximal promoter of Cu,Zn-SOD. Thus, RA regula-\ntion of Cu,Zn-SOD gene expression may require\ninteraction with other cellular components, such as\nother cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs,\nsee for review Noy [43]). The possible involvement of\nCRABPs in mediating this down-regulatory effect of RA\non Cu,Zn-SOD expression is of interest in view of the\nfinding that CRABP II levels are elevated in psoriatic\nskin [44] and awaits further analysis. While in this report\nwe studied the effect of RA on psoriatic fibroblasts, as\nan immunologic sentinel. RA has other cellular targets\nin psoriasis such as keratinocytes and T lymphocytes.\nThus it is quite possible that Cu,Zn-SOD could also be\ninvolved in the prevention of T-cell apoptosis [46]. This\nhypothesis awaits further testing.\n\nIn conclusion, RA treatment of primary psoriatic\nfibroblasts resulted in a significant decrease in the\nelevated level of Mn-SOD activity found in these cells\nat a level similar to that in normal fibroblasts. This\n\n\n\n77P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78\nregulatory effect of RA could be at the level of protein\ncovalent modification or subcellular localization or at\nthe Mn-SOD mRNA steady-state level, since there was\nno significant change in total cellular Mn-SOD protein\nlevels. Retinoic acid treatment of both normal and\npsoriatic fibroblasts also caused a decrease in Cu,Zn-\nSOD activity that appeared to be at the level of\ntranscriptional regulation. Thus our data begins to\nprovide a biochemical basis for the use of RA in the\ntreatment of psoriasis.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Dr Isabelle Gorin from the\nDepartment of Dermatology, Ho\u0302pital Tarnier (Paris)\nfor her kind clinical assistance.
