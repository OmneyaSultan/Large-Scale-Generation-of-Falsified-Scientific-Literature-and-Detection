Animals were injected with\nthe cytokine, and 4 h later, a homogenate from the cortical and medullary tissues was prepared and used to assay the activity of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe\n\nATPase and the protein expression of the pump and symporter. TNF-a reduced the activity and expression of the pump in both cortex and\nmedulla, and its effect disappeared when animals were pre-treated with indomethacin, suggesting that TNF-a acts via PGE2. Higher levels\nof PGE2 were detected by enzyme immunoassay, in kidney tissues isolated from rats treated with PGE2, thus confirming this hypothesis.\nThe cytokine also down-regulated the Na\n\n\u00fe\n-K\n\u00fe\n\n2Cl\n\ufffd\n\ncotransporter but this effect was not abrogated by indomethacin. PGE2, injected into\nanimals, exerted a dose-dependent effect. Low doses did not have any effect on the two transporters in the cortex while high doses inhibited\nand down-regulated the pump and up-regulated the cotransporter. In the medulla low doses increased the activity and expression of the\npump but down-regulated the cotransporter while high doses exerted an exactly opposite effect on the two transporters. It was concluded\nthat the effect of TNF-a on the pump is mediated via PGE2 which is released at relatively high doses. The effect of the cytokine on the\ncotransporter is, however, independent of PGE2.\n\ufffd 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nTumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is a pro-inflammatory\ncytokine with a wide range of biological effects. It plays a cen-\ntral role in shock due to sepsis [1,2] and has been implicated,\ndirectly or indirectly, in the pathogenesis of renal failure [3,4].\n\nThe cytokine is released by the thick ascending limb of the\nloop of Henle in rats challenged with LPS, and was shown to\nexert cytotoxic effects and interfere with ion transport mecha-\nnisms across epithelia [5]. Dogs infused with TNF-a had\nmarked nartriuresis and polyuria [6].\n\nSince one of the major functions of the kidney is the regu-\nlation of body fluid osmolality and electrolyte balance, TNF-a\n\n* Corresponding author.

The Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase\nalso known as the Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump is a key transporter that\nregulates the activity of many others. It is a highly conserved\nintegral membrane protein, which couples ATP hydrolysis to\nNa\u00fe and K\u00fe transfer across the plasma membrane against their\nelectrochemical gradient [7]. By establishing Na\u00fe and K\u00fe gra-\ndients across the cell membrane, it provides the driving force\nfor the activity of other transporters like the Na\u00fe/H\u00fe and the\nNa\u00fe/Ca2\u00fe exchangers and the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter\nthat regulates, respectively, cytoplasmic pH, Ca2\u00fe levels, and\ncellular volume. The Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump also drives a variety of\nsecondary active transport processes in the nephron like those\ninvolving amino acids and glucose reabsorption.

Markossian / Cytokine 33 (2006) 138e144\nthe kidney tubules and is composed of two functional subunits:\na catalytic a subunit (w110e113 kDa) containing the binding\nsites for ATP, sodium, potassium, phosphate and cardiac gly-\ncosides [8] and a b subunit (w35e55 kDa glycoprotein)\nneeded for the activity of the enzymatic complex [9]. The\nb subunit also facilitates plasma membrane localization and\nis responsible for the early structural and functional matura-\ntions of the a subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum [8]. Sev-\neral isoforms of both a and b subunits have been identified\nand all of them are capable of forming functionally active en-\nzymes [10]. They are expressed in different cell types contrib-\nuting in each to multiple specialized properties [11]. The a1\nand b1 subunits perform housekeeping functions, and are\nhighly expressed in the kidney. In the rat, their abundance is\nhighest in cortical and medullary thick ascending limbs of\nthe loop of Henle and the proximal convoluted tubule [12].\n\nAnother important transporter in the kidney is the\nNa\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd (NKCC) cotransporter which couples the move-\nment of 1Na\u00fe with 1K\u00fe and 2 Cl\ufffd. The symporter uses the\npotential energy released by the downhill movement of Na\u00fe\n\nand Cl\ufffd to drive the uphill movement of K\u00fe into the cell. Two\nisoforms have been identified: NKCC1, present in the basolat-\neral membrane of a wide variety of secretory epithelia; and\nNKCC2, present only in the medullary region of the kidney\n[13,14], and localized to the apical membrane of the epithelial\ncells [15]. In epithelia, the cotransporter is responsible for the\nnet transcellular Cl\ufffd movement from one side of the cell to the\nother. By raising intracellular Cl\ufffd above electrochemical equi-\nlibrium, it provides the driving force needed for Cl\ufffd exit on\nthe other side of the cell.\n\nIt is apparent that both the Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump and the\nNa\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd symporter play a crucial role in the regulation\nof electrolyte movements across kidney tubules, and in the in-\ndirect maintenance of body fluid osmolality. The importance of\nthese two transporters incited us to investigate whether they\nconstitute target sites for TNF-a action. The aim of this work\nwas to study the effect of TNF-a on the Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump and\nthe Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd (NKCC1 in particular) transporter in kidney\ncells isolated from rats treated in vivo with the cytokine.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Animal treatment\n\nMale SpragueeDawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) were used\nand were handled all through in accordance with the Guide for\nLaboratory Animal Facilities and Care, US Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare.\n\nRats weighing around 250 g were injected i.p. with TNF-a\n(170 ng/100 g body weight) 4 h prior to the beginning of the\nexperiment, or with different doses of PGE2 (21 and\n0.37 mg/100 g BW) 15 min before the beginning of the\nexperiment. These time points were chosen based on a similar\nwork studying the effect of TNF-a in the rat distal colon\n(unpublished data). When indomethacin was used, it was\ninjected i.p. (1 mg/100 g BW) 10 min before TNF-a. TNF-a\nwas dissolved in physiological saline. Ethanol and dimethyl\nsulfoxide (DMSO) were used as respective vehicles for\nPGE2 and indomethacin. A similar volume of the vehicles\nwas injected into control rats.\n\nTo ensure that any observed effect is due to TNF-a and not due\nto a contaminant like the lipopolysaccharide, TNF-a was heated\nfor 20 min at 70 \ufffdC and its effect on the pump was studied.\n\n2.2. Preparation of kidney cortical and medullary\nhomogenates\n\nRats were anesthetized by i.p. injection of pentobarbital\n(5 mg/100 g body weight) and their abdomen were opened\nthrough a lateral incision. The intestine and stomach were\npushed aside to expose the left kidney for its perfusion with\nTris buffer (buffer A: 200 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2$6H2O;\n2 mM EGTA; 5 mM KCl; 200 mM TriseHCl, pH 7.4).\nA heparinized catheter was introduced into the aorta just above\nthe level of the left renal artery to allow the infusion of the\nbuffer. The mesenteric artery and the right renal artery were\nboth ligated. The left renal vein was cut for drainage. The left\nkidney was perfused for 10 min with Tris buffer at a rate of\n5 ml/min until cleared from blood. The bleached kidney was ex-\ncised, its capsule removed, cut longitudinally and small pieces\nfrom the cortex and medullary tissues were then removed and\nhomogenized in Tris buffer for around 5 min with a polytron\n(20 000e22 000 rpm) at 4 \ufffdC. Protease inhibitors were added\nto the samples which were kept at \ufffd20 \ufffdC for later use.\n\n2.3. PGE2 assay\n\nKidneys were isolated from animals treated with TNF-a.\nCortical and medullary tissues were immediately excised,\ncut into small pieces, and homogenized in presence of\nindomethacin at 4 \ufffdC to inhibit any additional PGE2 synthesis.\nTotal PGE2 (intracellular and extracellular) extraction and\nassay were conducted using an enzyme immunoassay kit\nfrom Amersham Biosciences (PGE2 Biotrak EIA system) fol-\nlowing exactly the protocol described by the manufacturer.\n\n2.4. Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase assay\n\nA crude membrane homogenate was prepared by spinning\nhomogenized cells at 3300\ufffd g for 10 min at 4 \ufffdC. Membrane\nhomogenates were then diluted in Tris buffer (buffer A) to\na final concentration of 2 mg/ml protein and incubated for\n30 min with saponin (0.02% final concentration) at room tem-\nperature. After a pre-incubation at 37 \ufffdC for 10 min in the\npresence or absence of ouabain (4 mM final concentration),\nthe reaction was initiated by addition of ATP to a final concen-\ntration of 1.25 mM, and terminated after a 1-h incubation at\n37 \ufffdC by addition of trichloroacetic acid (200 ml, 11%). The\namount of inorganic phosphate liberated was measured color-\nimetrically according to the method of Taussky and Shorr [16],\nand the activity of the enzyme was determined by measuring\nthe ouabain-inhibitable inorganic phosphate liberated.\n\n\n\n140 S.I.

Western blot analysis\n\nMembrane proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad\nreagent and were equally loaded and resolved on 8% poly-\nacrylamide gels, then transferred onto a PVDF membrane\n(Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules,\nCA 94547, USA) . Protein expression of b actin was used to\ncheck the equal loading. The PVDF membrane was then\nwashed, blocked and incubated overnight at 4 \ufffdC with a rabbit\nanti-Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase a-1 IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake\nPlacid, NY 12946, USA), or with an anti-rat sodium potassium\nchloride cotransporter antibody (Alpha Diagnostic Interna-\ntional, TX, USA). Detection of the signal was by enhanced\nchemiluminescence using luminol reagent (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology Inc., CA, USA).\n\nAutoradiographs were analyzed by densitometry using\na Gel-Pro(2) Analyzer software. The intensities of the signals\nare reported as a percentage of the control value.\n\n2.6. Statistical analysis\n\nResults are reported as mean\ufffd SEM. Statistical signifi-\ncance was tested by a one-way analysis of variance followed\nby a TukeyeKramer multiple comparison.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effect of TNF-a and indomethacin on the activity\nand protein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase\n\nTNF-a decreased the protein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe\n\nATPase in both kidney cortex and medulla (Fig. 1). This effect\ndid not appear when heated TNF-a was used. Indomethacin,\nan inhibitor of COX enzymes, did not have any effect on the\nexpression of the pump and in its presence, the down-regulatory\neffect of the cytokine did not appear.\n\nThe effect of TNF-a and indomethacin on the pump activ-\nity followed a similar trend. The cytokine reduced the ATPase\nactivity down to around 40% of its control value (Fig. 2). This\ninhibitory effect disappeared, however, in the presence of\nindomethacin.\n\n3.2.

Effect of TNF-a on PGE2 levels in the kidney\n\nTNF-a caused a significant increase in the level of PGE2 in\nboth kidney cortex and medulla (Fig. 4).\n\n3.4. Dose-dependent effect of PGE2 on the activity and\nprotein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase\n\nLow doses of PGE2 (0.37 mg/100 g BW) injected into\nanimals up-regulated the pump in the kidney medullary cells\n(Fig. 5) and increased its activity (Fig. 6), but were without\nany effect on the ATPase in cortical cells (Figs. 5 and 6).\nHigh doses (21 mg/100 g BW), however, reduced the activity\nand protein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase in both cortex\nand medulla (Figs. 5 and 6).\n\n3.5. Dose-dependent effect of PGE2 on the protein\nexpression of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter\n\nIn the cortex (Fig. 7), low doses of PGE2 did not have any\neffect on the expression of the cotransporter while high doses\ncaused an up-regulation.\nTNF\nindomethacin\n\n-        +      +     - \n-        -       +     + \n\n\u03b2 actin \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\u03b11\u03b11\n\n\u03b2 actin \n\nTNF-\u03b1 -    +     +      -\nIndomethacin -     -     +      +\n\n\u03b11\n\n\u03b2 actin\n\n(c)\n\nHeated TNF-\u03b1 -       + \n\n\u03b11\n\n\u03b2 actin \n\nHeated TNF-\u03b1 -      + \n\n(d) \n\nFig. 1.

Markossian / Cytokine 33 (2006) 138e144\nIn the medulla (Fig. 7), PGE2 affected the protein expres-\nsion of the cotransporter in a dose-dependent manner. The pro-\ntein expression was reduced at low doses and increased at high\ndoses.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis work demonstrated a TNF-a-induced decrease in the\nactivity and protein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump in\nboth renal cortex and medulla. The decrease in activity was\nascribed to the reduction in the abundance of enzyme\nmolecules.\n\nThis effect did not appear, however, when the rat was pre-\ninjected with indomethacin, an inhibitor of COX enzymes,\nsuggesting that the effect of the cytokine is mediated through\nPGE2. This hypothesis was further confirmed by the observed\nincrease in renal PGE2 levels induced by TNF-a, and sup-\nported by many other works reporting a PGE2-mediated effect\nof TNF-a. The cytokine for example was reported in the liter-\nature to induce cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression in pri-\nmary cultures of the medullary thick ascending limb [17] and\nincrease PGE2 synthesis in mesangial cells [18] and bovine\nchondrocytes [19].\n\nAA\n\nB\n\nA\naa\n\nb\n\na\n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\n80%\n\n100%\n\n120%\n\nControl Indomethacin\n\n%\n \nC\n\no\nn\n\nt\nr\no\n\nl\n \nA\n\nc\nt\ni\nv\na\nt\ni\no\n\nn\n\nCortex\n\nMedulla\n\nTNF TNF +\nIndomethacin\n\nFig. 2.

Bars sharing a common letter are not significantly different;\n\nP< 0.05.\nAnother effect of TNF-a demonstrated in this work was the\ndecrease in protein expression of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd (NKCC)\ncotransporter in the cortex and medulla (Fig. 3), an effect\nthat was not abrogated by indomethacin and which is not con-\nsequently dependent on PGE2.\n\nTwo isoforms of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter (NKCC)\nare known to be present in mammalian tissues: NKCC1 and\nNKCC2 [20e24].\n\nThe isoform studied in this work is the NKCC1. A decrease\nin the abundance of this cotransporter is expected to reduce the\ntransepithelial NaCl transport from the serosal to the mucosal\nside into the tubular lumen, and may come as a consequence\nof the TNF-a-induced decrease in the Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase activ-\nity which provides the driving force for this symporter. It is\nalso in line with the reported diuretic and natriuretic effects\nof TNF-a [6].\n\nTNF-a signaling is a very complex process. TNF-a can\nactivate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), nuclear\nfactor kappa B (NF-kB), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), prote-\nases, ceramides, and reactive oxygen species [25]. On the\nother hand the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd is regulated by phosphoryla-\ntion/dephosphorylation or changes in its gene expression\n[26]. The abundance of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter in\nthe thick ascending limb of the kidney was found to be regu-\nlated by vasopressin via a cAMP-mediated increase in the\ntranscription of its gene, which contains a cAMP regulatory el-\nement [27]. Recently, TNF-a was shown to reduce cAMP\nlevels by targeting the enzyme adenylate cyclase through\na mechanism involving NF-kB [28]. Thus in this study,\nTNF-a may have down-regulated the cotransporter by reduc-\ning the basal level of cAMP, thus decreasing the transcription\n\nb\n\na\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\ncontrol TNF\n\n \n \n\nP\nG\n\nE\n2\n \n(\nn\n\ng\n/\nm\n\ng\n \np\n\nr\no\n\nt\ne\ni\nn\n\n)\n \n\nP\nG\n\nE\n2\n \n(\nn\n\ng\n/\nm\n\ng\n \np\n\nr\no\n\nt\ne\ni\nn\n\n)\n \n\nMedulla \n\nb\n\na\n\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\n10\n12\n\ncontrol TNF\n\nCortex\n\nFig. 4.

This path-\nway, however, is still speculative and would need to be con-\nfirmed by future experimental work.\n\nIt can be concluded that TNF-a affects the pump and the\nsymporter via, respectively, PGE2-dependent and PGE2-inde-\npendent pathways.\n\nInjection of the animals with a low dose (0.37 mg/100 g\nBW) of the prostaglandin did not affect the activity nor the\nprotein expression of the Na\u00feeK\u00fe pump in the kidney cortex,\nbut increased both significantly in the medulla. A higher dose\n(21 mg/100 g BW), however, reduced the ATPase activity and\nprotein expression in both cortex and medulla, and thus ex-\nerted a similar effect to that observed with TNF-a. The results\nsuggest that the cytokine induces the release of PGE2 at levels\nhigh enough to induce inhibition and down-regulation of the\n\nb\n\na\n\na\n\nC\n\nB\n\nA\n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\n80%\n\n100%\n\n120%\n\n140%\n\n160%\n\n180%\n\n200%\n\ncontrol 0.37 21\n\n%\n \nC\n\no\nn\n\nt\nr\no\n\nl\n \nA\n\nc\nt\ni\nv\ni\nt\ny\n\nCortex\nMedulla\n\nFig. 6.

The decrease in pump activity correlated here again\nvery well with the decrease in its expression and was ascribed\nto a reduction in the number of the ATPase molecules.\n\nThis dose-dependent response to the prostaglandin may be\nattributed to the activation of different types of PGE2 receptors\n(EP receptors) having different signal transduction pathways\nand different affinities for the prostaglandin. EP1 receptors\nare known to signal via an increase in intracellular calcium\n[29e31] and are present in the collecting duct, increasing in\nabundance from the cortex to the papillae [32]. They were\nalso detected in the nuclear envelope where they can regulate\n\n(b)\n\nControl 0.37 21\n\nControl 0.37 21\n\nNa+-K+2Cl-\n\nNa+-K+2Cl-\n\n\u03b2 actin \n\n\u03b2 actin \n\n(a)\n\nFig. 7.

Activation of these receptors was shown\nto inhibit renal Na\u00fe and water reabsorptions and contributes to\nnatriuresis and diuresis. EP2 and EP4 are coupled to a Gs pro-\ntein and cause an increase in cAMP levels [34,35]. EP2 recep-\ntors exhibit a low level of expression in the kidney and their\nprecise localization is uncertain [36] while EP4 was detected\nin the collecting duct [32] and in the glomerulus [37].\n\nEP3 receptors are expressed in the medullary thick ascend-\ning limb and collecting duct. When activated they inhibit\ncAMP generation via Gi [33] and are consequently expected\nto exert an opposite effect to that of EP2 and EP3.\n\nMany hormones and mediators are known to exert a long-\nor a short-term regulatory effect on the Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase.\nShort-term regulation usually involves changes in the kinetics\nof the enzyme or its translocation between the plasma mem-\nbrane and intracellular stores. Protein kinases, mainly PKC\nand PKA, were shown to play a major role in this regulation.\n\nIn the kidney, inhibition of the sodium pump in proximal\nsegments of the nephron was reported to be mediated through\nG protein-linked PKC-dependent pathways [38,39], whereas\nin distal segments, PKA-associated pathways are involved\n[40,41]. Activation of the pump by PKA in the renal proximal\ntubule was demonstrated to be secondary to an increase in its\ntranslocation to the plasma membrane [42]. Similarly inhibi-\ntion of the pump was shown to come as a consequence of\nits phosphorylation by PKC at Ser-23 [43e45].\n\nIn some cases PKA was shown to regulate the pump indi-\nrectly by altering the activity of other Na\u00fe transporters and\nconsequently intracellular Na\u00fe which in turn leads to a change\nin the ATPase activity [46].\n\nIt has also been suggested [47] that phosphorylation of the\nrat Na\u00feeK\u00fe ATPase at Ser-23 by PKC requires prior phos-\nphorylation by PKA at Ser-943.\n\nIn this work EP1 and EP4 are suspected to mediate the effect\nof high doses of PGE2 because they have a lower affinity for the\nprostaglandin than EP3 [35] and activate, respectively, PKC\nand cAMP signaling which have been shown to inhibit both\nNa\u00fe and water reabsorptions in the thick ascending limb of\nthe loop of Henle and the collecting duct [48]. EP3 may be in-\nvolved in the up-regulatory effect PGE2 observed at low doses\nin kidney medulla due to its higher affinity for PGE2 and its\nmechanism of action which involves a decrease in cAMP pro-\nduction resulting in an increase in Na\u00fe transport [36].\n\nDifferent doses of PGE2 also exerted a dual trend on the\nexpression of the Na\u00fe-K\u00fe2Cl\ufffd symporter. Low doses had no\neffect in the cortex while high doses caused an up-regulation\nof the cotransporter. In the medulla down-regulation was\nobserved at low doses while an opposite increase in the sym-\nporter expression was observed at high doses. Thus, at all\ndoses studied, the effect of PGE2 on the cotransporter was\nopposite to its effect on the pump. When the pump was\ndown-regulated and inhibited, the cotransporter was up-\nregulated and vice versa. The two transporters are thus work-\ning in concert to regulate NaCl uptake from the tubular lumen\nand consequently water. The opposite effect observed at high\ndoses may come as a form of negative feedback mechanism,\nor a way by which the same mediator can be used, depending\non its level to exert opposite effects on salt reabsorption\ndepending on body needs.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the University\nResearch Board.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Beutler BA, Milsark IW, Cerami A.
