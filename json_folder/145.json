Interleukin (IL)-16 is a CD4C cell-specific chemoattractant cytokine. In CD4C T cells, production of bioactive IL-16 from\nconstitutive pro-IL-16 requires cleavage by active caspase-3. We reported reversal of established relapsing disease by IL-16 neutralization.\nTo better understand role(s) of IL-16 in regulation of relapsing EAE, we comparatively analyzed levels of IL-16, active caspase-3 and CD4\nin mice with severe relapsing-remitting [(B6! SJL) F1], and low-relapsing (B6), disease. Elevated levels of IL-16 along with an increase\nin active-caspase-3 and CD4 levels correlated with stages of clinically active disease in both strains. CNS levels of bioactive IL-16 were notably\nhigher in F1 compared to B6 mice at all stages, being most prominent during relapse. Similar patterns of regulation for IL-16 and active caspase-\n3 were observed in peripheral lymphoid organs, and in T cells isolated from lymph nodes following T-cell activation in vitro. IL-16 was co-\nimmunoprecipitated with CD4 from CNS of relapsing mice. Our data suggest that caspase-3 mediated production of IL-16 by infiltrating\nCD4C T cells, contributes to ongoing neuroinflammation by chemoattraction of additional waves of CD4C T cells.\n\ufffd 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an\nautoimmune CD4C Th1 mediated disease. EAE serves as\na model for human autoimmune demyelinating disease multi-\nple sclerosis (MS) [1,2]. By producing and locally secreting\nTh1-type cytokines, such as interleukin-2, interferon (IFN)-\ng, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, encephalitogenic\nCD4C T cells induce activation of neighboring astrocytes\nand microglia, which then in turn produce more inflamma-\ntory cytokines and chemokines [3e5]. In addition to cytokine\nproduction and stimulation of glial cells, infiltrating T cells\ndirectly contribute to local chemokine accumulation [6e8].\nProduction and local accumulation of chemokines within the\n\n* Corresponding author.

Findings of elevated levels of several CC and CXC\nchemokines in CNS in correlation with stages of clinically\nactive disease suggested their role in regulation of inflammatory\ncell trafficking into CNS [10,11]. This hypothesis was further\nsupported by later experiments, showing complete or partial re-\nsistance to EAE induction in either chemokine or chemokine-\nspecific receptor deficient mice [12e14].\n\nWe have recently demonstrated that another chemoattractant\nfactor, a cytokine interleukin-16 (IL-16), has been associated\nwith the pathology of relapsing-remitting EAE [15]. As\nopposed to the majority of CC and CXC chemokines implicated\nin the immunopathology of EAE, which do not discriminate be-\ntween cell phenotypes, IL-16 is a CD4C T-cell-specific chemo-\nattractant cytokine. IL-16 is a more effective chemoattractant\nfor Th1 than for Th2 CD4C T cells [16]. Cytokine IL-16 has\n\nmailto:skundric@cmb.biosci.wayne.edu\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/08968411\n\n\n207D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214\nbeen identified as a major source of T-cell chemotactic activity\nand was originally named leukocyte chemoattractant factor\n(LCF) [17]. In addition to chemoattraction of CD4C cells,\nIL-16 exerts proinflammatory and immunomodulatory proper-\nties, which include regulation of CD4C T-cell activation, and\nregulation of chemokine induced chemoattraction [18].\n\nThe precursor molecule, pro-IL-16 (80 kDa) is constitutively\nproduced in T lymphocytes. Activation and release of bioactive\nIL-16 (17 kDa) is distinctly regulated among T-cell subsets. In\nCD4C T cells, T-cell receptor (TCR) mediated or cytokine-\ninduced T-cell activation, leads to the enzymatic cleavage\nof pro-IL-16 by activated caspase-3 and release of active\nC-terminal portion of IL-16 (14e17 kDa), while secretion of\nIL-16 from CD8C T cells is caspase-3 independent [18].\nIt has been suggested that C-terminal cleavage of pro-IL-16 is\nregulated by phosphorylation of pro-IL-16 on Ser144, which\nengages Erk1/2 kinase activity, while the secretion of bioactive\nIL-16 is regulated by MAP kinase [19]. While in quiescent\nCD4C T cells only pro-IL-16 (80 kDa) can be detected,\nupon cell activation, an intermediate product of cleavage\n(50e60 kDa) and active IL-16 (14e17 kDa) are readily obser-\nved. Secreted IL-16 multimerizes into homotetramers com-\nposed of 14e17 kDa chains, necessary for the binding to CD4\nreceptor and subsequent signaling. Bioactive IL-16 induces che-\nmoattraction of CD4C T cells by binding to CD4 receptor and\nsignaling that involves p56lck, protein kinase C,with the require-\nment for SH2/SH3 recruitment domains, which suggest involve-\nment of other intracellular signaling proteins [20]. While the\nsecreted C-terminal domain of IL-16 achieves its pleiotropic\neffects on CD4C cells through CD4-initiated signaling path-\nways, the residual N-terminal domain translocate to the nucleus,\nwhere it induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Nuclear translocation\nof N-terminal portion of IL-16 is enabled by the CcN motif,\nwhich contains nuclear localization sequence (NLS), protein\nkinase CK2 substrate site and a cdc2 kinase substrate site [21].\n\nIncreased local production of IL-16 has been reported in\nother CD4C Th1 mediated autoimmune diseases, such as\nrheumatoid arthritis and Graves\u2019 disease [22,23]. In CNS of\n(B6 ! SJL) F1 mice with relapsing-remitting EAE, we ob-\nserved IL-16 immunoreactivity confined to CD4C, CD8C\nT cells and B cells. Our data suggest that IL-16 play an impor-\ntant role in regulation of relapsing EAE in (B6 ! SJL) F1\n(H-2b/s) mice, as anti-IL-16 therapy improved clinical and\nhistopathology of relapsing disease [15].\n\nIn the present study, we examined and compared mecha-\nnisms of IL-16 regulation between relapsing-remitting and\nnon/low-relapsing EAE mice.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Mice and induction of EAE\n\nEAE was induced in 8e10-week-old C57BL/6 (B6) (H-2b)\nand (B6 ! SJL) F1 (H-2b/s) female mice (Jackson Laborato-\nries, Bar Harbor, ME) by immunization with MOG35e55\n(MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK), 99% pure by HPLC,\n(Caltech, Pasadena, CA), as previously described [8]. Mice\nwere observed daily for clinical symptoms of EAE. The clin-\nical grade was scored as follows: 0.5, partial loss of tail tonic-\nity; 1, complete loss of tail tonicity; 2, flaccid tail and\nabnormal gait; 3, hind leg paralysis; 4, hind leg paralysis\nwith hind body paresis; 5, hind and foreleg paralysis, 6,\nmoribund.\n\n2.2. Tissue sampling\n\nMice were killed at different stages of relapsing-remitting\ndisease: acute, remission, relapse and chronic. Approximately\n3e4 mice from each strain were analyzed at each stage of dis-\nease. Mice were anesthetized, perfused through the heart with\n10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and spinal\ncord, brain, spleen and regional lymph nodes were dissected.\nFrom each dissected tissue, 1e2-mm blocks were cut and em-\nbedded in Tissue Compound (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The re-\nmaining tissues were snap-frozen for protein isolation. Frozen\nblocks and tissue samples were kept at \ufffd70 \ufffdC until analyzed.\n\n2.3. Antibodies\n\nFor immunostaining, Western blot and immunoprecipita-\ntion, primary antibodies against: human IL-16 unconjugated\nand R-Phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated (clone 14.1) (1:200),\nand mouse CD-4 (rat IgG2a,kdclone RM4-5) (BD Pharmin-\ngen, San Diego, CA); human/mouse active Caspase-3\n(1:200), (R&D Systems); p85 fragment of polyADP-ribose\npolymerase (PARP) (Promega, Madison, WI), and glyceralde-\nhyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Santa Cruz),\nwere used. Isotype matched control antibody used for immu-\nnoprecipitation as a control for CD4-specific antibody was\npurified rat IgG2a, k (clone R35-95, BD Pharmingen).\n\n2.4. Western blot\n\nProtein was isolated from fresh frozen spinal cord, spleen\nand lymph node tissues using TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL,\nGrand Island, NY) according to the procedure recommended\nby the manufacturer. Equal amounts of protein (approximately\n20 mg/lane) from each sample were loaded per lane for West-\nern blot analysis. Samples were loaded at nonreducing condi-\ntions onto NuPage Novex Tris-Acetate gels (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA), resolved by electrophoresis. Electrophoresed\nproteins were then transferred from the gel onto nitrocellulose\nmembrane. Membrane was cut into 3e4 strips, each contain-\ning proteins of different molecular weight. Each membrane\nstrip was probed separately with the appropriate primary anti-\nbody overnight at 4 \ufffdC, washed three times with 0.1% Tween\n20eTris-buffered saline, and than incubated with peroxidase\nconjugated secondary antibody. The membrane bound peroxi-\ndase activity was detected by using ECL Plus Western blotting\ndetection kits (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). Chemilu-\nminescent images were captured and analyzed by a Kodak\nDigital Science Image Station 440CF. All blots were studied\n\n\n\n208 D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214\nwithin the linear range of exposure. In each sample levels of\nIL-16, active caspase-3 and CD4 were normalized by corre-\nsponding levels of GAPDH.\n\n2.5. Immunoprecipitation\n\nCD4 protein was immunoprecipitated from total proteins\nisolated from spinal cord of EAE mice using a Seize Primary\nImmunoprecipitation kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL), following the\nmanufacturer\u2019s procedure. Immunoprecipitation with control\nantibody was done similarly in a separate experiment. CD4\nand control immunoprecipitates were then subjected to West-\nern blot analysis.\n\n2.6. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy\n\nSimilarly prepared 6-mm frozen sections were used to ana-\nlyze phenotypes of infiltrating cells by immunofluorescence,\nfollowing a routine procedure [8]. Briefly, sections were air-\ndried, acetone-fixed, treated with 10% normal donkey serum\nfor 10 min, followed by overnight incubation with relevant pri-\nmary antibody in a moist chamber at C4 \ufffdC. The slides were\nthen washed and incubated with secondary fluorochrome-\nlabeled antibodies for 30 min. DAPI staining was performed\nfor 5 min after immunostaining was completed. After wash-\ning, the slides were mounted in Gelmount (Biomeda, Foster\nCity, CA) and analyzed by light and fluorescent microscopy.\nImages were captured on a Nikon Eclipse 600 epifluorescent\nmicroscope with a Princeton Instruments Micromax 5 MHz\ncooled CCD camera.\n\n2.7. In vitro T-cell stimulation\n\nFrom anesthetized (B6 ! SJL) F1 (3 relapsing and 2 with\nchronic disease) and B6 (2 relapsing) mice, spleens were\ndissected and cells were prepared for in vitro experiments.\nSplenic and lymph node isolated T cells (5! 105/well) were\nstimulated with 25 mg/ml of MOG35e55 in RPMI 1640 (Sigma,\nSt. Louis, MO) supplemented with 1% normal mouse serum.\nCells were cultured in 96-well flat-bottom plates for 72 h\nand incubated at 37 \ufffdC in humidified air containing 5%\nCO2. Following in vitro activation, approximately 5 ! 10\n\n6\n\ncells (12 wells) were treated with Brefeldin A (10 mg/ml)\n(Sigma), prior to collection and protein isolation. Proteins\nfrom stimulated T cells were then analyzed by Western blot.\nFrom control (B6 ! SJL) F1 mice, splenic T cells were\nsimilarly isolated and stimulated with PHA (10 mg/ml) for\n72 h in vitro. Proteins were isolated from cells at the end of\nculture period, and subjected to Western blot analysis.\n\n2.8. Statistical analysis\n\nThe significance of differences between groups was calcu-\nlated by Student\u2019s t-test or paired-test as appropriate. The level\nof statistical significance was set at 95%.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Increased CNS levels of bioactive IL-16 during\nclinically active disease correspond to elevation of\nactive-caspase-3 and CD4C T-cell infiltration\n\nThe levels of bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) in spinal cord from\nrelapsing-remitting (B6 ! SJL) F1, and low/relapsing (B6)\nmice are shown in Fig. 1. Compared to control levels, which\nwere indistinguishable between the two strains of mice, we\nfound markedly higher upregulation of bioactive IL-16, during\nstages of active disease, in F1 than in B6 mice. Levels of IL-16\nwere significantly elevated during acute, relapsing and chronic\nstages of the disease. At each stage of disease, comparison was\nmade between F1 and B6 mice with similar disease severity\nscores (differences not grater than one grade on a 0e6 scale).\nLevels of bioactive IL-16 were markedly higher in mice with\nacute EAE compared to control levels. Bioactive IL-16 peaked\nat relapsing, slightly decreased at chronic, but still remained\nsignificantly higher compared to controls in (B6 ! SJL) F1\nmice. B6 mice with chronic disease were not examined\nbecause the majority of these mice recovered either following\ndisease onset or relapse, similar to previous data [8]. In low-\nrelapsing, B6 mice, levels of bioactive IL-16 were increased\nbut not significantly different between acute and relapsing\ndisease (Fig. 1a,b). Although differences in levels of bioactive\nIL-16 were significant at acute ( p ! 0.05), strikingly different\nlevels of bioactive IL-16 were observed during relapsing dis-\nease between F1 and B6 mice. Relapsing F1 mice had approx-\nimately fourfold higher levels of bioactive IL-16 in CNS\ncompared to relapsing B6 mice ( p ! 0.001). During remis-\nsion, levels of bioactive IL-16 returned close to control values\nin both strains of mice. In parallel with the increase in levels of\nbioactive IL-16, an elevation of active caspase-3 in spinal cord\nof mice with relapsing EAE was observed. Upregulation of\nactive-caspase-3 followed trend similar to bioactive IL-16\nthroughout the course of relapsing EAE. Differences in the\nlevels of active caspase-3 between the F1 and B6 mice were\nconsistent with those found for bioactive IL-16 (Fig. 1a,c).\nRelative levels of bioactive IL-16 were approximately three-\nto fourfold higher compared to relative levels of active\ncaspase-3, during acute and relapsing EAE (Fig. 1b,c). Eleva-\ntion of active caspase-3 was not followed by elevation of\ncleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (not shown),\nsuggesting an apoptosis-unrelated role for active caspase-3\nin CNS of EAE mice. Active caspase-3 is important for the en-\nzymatic cleavage of bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) from pro-IL16\n(80 kDa) in activated CD4C T cells.\n\nPreviously, we observed that infiltrating CD4C T cells\ncontained IL-16 in spinal cord of (B6 ! SJL) F1 EAE mice\n[15]. Our data from semiquantitative analysis of immunos-\ntained spinal cord sections suggested more extensive infiltra-\ntion by CD4C T cells during the acute and especially\nrelapsing disease in (B6 ! SJL) F1 then B6 mice [8]. In\nthis experiment we measured levels of CD4 from total proteins\nisolated from spinal cord by Western blot (Fig. 2). Regulation\nof CD4 levels paralleled those of bioactive IL-16 and active\n\n\n\n209D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214\nFig. 1. Similar patterns of regulation between bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) and active caspase-3 are observed in CNS of (B6 ! SJL) F1 and B6 mice throughout the\n\ncourse of relapsing disease. (a) Levels of bioactive IL-16 and active caspase-3 from total proteins isolated from spinal cord of EAE mice were analyzed by Western\n\nblot. Compared to low constitutive expression, marked upregulation in levels of both proteins was observed during acute, relapsing and chronic stages of disease in\n\nboth strains of mice. (b) Production of bioactive IL-16 was consistently higher in F1 compared to B6 mice. (c) Levels of active caspase-3, similarly to bioactive IL-\n\n16, were markedly higher in F1 compared to B6 mice. Approximately 20 mg of total protein was loaded per lane. From each stage of the disease of each mouse\n\nstrain total of 3e4 mice were analyzed. Representative blot shows: acute-F1 (12 dpi, grade 4.5), B6 (20 dpi, grade 5); remission-F1 (28 dpi, grade 1), B6 (23 dpi,\ngrade 0.5); relapse-F1 (68 dpi, grade 4, 3rd relapse), B6 (23 dpi, grade 4, 1st relapse); and chronic-F1 (70 dpi, grade 3); B6 (30 dpi, grade 4). Data for CD4, IL-16\n\n(80 and 55 kDa) from these samples are shown in Figs. 2, 6 and 7.\n\nFig. 2. Levels of CD4 protein in CNS of (B6 ! SJL) F1 and B6 mice were measured by Western blot. Similar patterns of regulation between levels of CD4 and\n\nproduction of bioactive IL-16 and active caspase-3 (Fig. 1) were observed. Markedly higher levels of CD4 were found in F1 then in B6 mice.\n\n\n\n210 D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214\ncaspase-3 in CNS of relapsing mice. Levels of CD4 were\nhigher in (B6 ! SJL) F1 than in B6 mice, which was consis-\ntent with our previous report. We than preceded to investigate\nwhether infiltrating CD4C T cells produce bioactive IL-16 in\nthe CNS of EAE mice. Because of the lack of antibody that\nwould distinguish between the pro-IL-16, which is constitu-\ntively present in CD4C T cells, and bioactive IL-16, which\nis cleaved from pro-molecule by active caspase-3 upon cell\nactivation, we analyzed spinal cord sections by two-color im-\nmunostaining and confocal microscopy. The colocalization of\nIL-16 with active caspase-3 in infiltrating cells in spinal cord\nof relapsing EAE mouse is shown in Fig. 3. Active caspse-3\nwas observed in most IL-16-containing infiltrating mononu-\nclear cells (Fig. 3, arrows) but also in neighboring cells within\nthe CNS. While the majority of IL-16 immunoreactive\ninfiltrating cells contained active caspase-3, only a few cells\nwithout apparent colocalization between IL-16 and active\ncaspase-3 were observed (Fig. 3, arrowheads).\n\n3.2. Splenic and lymph node T cells from EAE\nmice produce IL-16 in vitro\n\nOverall, data from analysis of IL-16, active caspase-3 and\nCD4 regulation, and colocalization in CNS of relapsing-\nremitting and low-relapsing strains of mice suggested that\nbioactive IL-16 could be produced locally by infiltrating\nCD4C T cells. Moreover, our results implied that its production\ncould be important for regulation of acute and especially relaps-\ning and chronic stages of disease. To explore the further potential\nof CD4C T cells to produce bioactive IL-16 in EAE, we ana-\nlyzed peripheral lymphoid organs, spleen and inguinal lymph\nnodes. We expected to find evidence for activation of IL-16 in\nregional lymph nodes and spleen of EAE mice, as a result of\nCD4C T-cell activation by immunization with MOG35e55 in\ncomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. Of especial interest to us was to in-\nvestigatewhether activation of IL-16 occurs at later stages of dis-\nease, relapse and chronic disease. High levels of bioactive IL-16\n(17 kDa) and IL-16 (55 kDa) were found in inguinal lymph\nnodes and spleen of both strains of mice with either relapsing\nor chronic disease. Similarly as observed in CNS, levels of active\ncaspase-3 corresponded to levels of bioactive IL-16 in peripheral\nlymphoid organs (Fig. 4). Distinctly from CNS, in the periphery\nmarked differences between F1 and B6 strains in levels of bioac-\ntive IL-16 and active caspase-3 were not observed.\n\n3.3. Levels of IL-16 in T cells following either polyclonal\nactivation, or restimulation with cognate antigen in vitro\n\nIn addition to analyzing IL-16 protein in intact peripheral\nlymphoid organs, we isolated T cells from lymph nodes and\nFig. 3. Colocalization between IL-16 and active-caspase-3 in infiltrating mononuclear cells in spinal cord was analyzed by confocal microscopy on two-color\n\nimmunostained spinal cord frozen sections.

Detail of merge image is shown in lower panel. Colocalized IL-16 and active caspse-3 were observed in\n\nmost of IL-16C infiltrating cells (arrows). Active caspase-3 was also observed in the neighboring cells, which did not contain IL-16. Few IL-16C cells did not\n\nshow active capse-3 immunostaining (arrowheads).

Control cells isolated from\nspleen of non-immunizedmice and polyclonally activated na\u0131\u0308ve\nsplenocytes were analyzed, and IL-16 activation was compared\n(Fig. 5). In control splenocytes, IL-16was not observed at appre-\nciable levels. Following 72 h activation with PHA, both bands\nindicating activation of IL-16, the 55 kDa and 17 kDa, were\nobserved. Similarly, 72 h restimulation with MOG35e55 of\neither splenic or lymph node isolated T cells from immunized\nmice resulted in activation of IL-16. Active caspase-3 was not\nobserved at times optimal for bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) and\nIL-16 (55 kDa) production (not shown). It is likely that cleavage\nof caspase-3, its intracellular accumulation and later degrada-\ntion of the active caspase-3 fragment is regulated differently\nthan cleavage of bioactive IL-16.\n\n3.4. Levels of IL-16 (55 kDa) are higher during active\nstages of disease in both strains of mice\n\nWe also found elevated levels of IL-16 (55 kDa), which is\nbelieved to be an intermediate product of pro-IL-16 cleavage.\n\nFig. 4. Levels of IL-16 (17 and 55 kDa) and active caspase-3 in spleen and\n\nlymph node of relapsing mice were analyzed by Western blot. Note marked\n\nupregulation of IL-16 (55 kDa) and bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) during relapsing\n\nand chronic stages. Active caspase-3 was elevated correspondingly. Represen-\n\ntative samples from 3e4 similar experiments show: relapse (F1: 36 dpi, grade\n3; B6: 21 dpi, grade 2); chronic (F1: 70 dpi, grade 4; B6: 25 dpi, grade 1).\n\nFig. 5. Production of bioactive IL-16 (55 and 17 kDa) was observed in activat-\n\ned T cells, isolated from mice immunized with MOG35e55. Ten days after im-\n\nmunization isolated T cells were in vitro restimulated with MOG35e55 (50 mg/\n\nml) for 72 h. In a different experiment, T cells isolated from na\u0131\u0308ve control\n\nmice were activated with PHA (10 mg/ml) for 72 h. For either restimulation\n\nwith MOG35e55 or polyclonal activation, approximately 5 ! 10\n6\ncells were\n\nstimulated/well in a 96-well plate. Following stimulation cells were collected,\n\nand total proteins were isolated and analyzed by Western blot. Representative\n\nblot from two similar experiments shows production of IL-16 17 kDa, and\n\n55 kDa, following T-cell activation, compared to control unstimulated T cells\n\nisolated from spleen of na\u0131\u0308ve mice.\nIn spinal cord of mice with EAE, IL-16 (55 kDa) was the most\nprominent compared to pro-IL-16 (80 kDa) (Figs. 6 and 7) and\nbioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) (Fig. 1). Similar temporal regulation\nof all three forms of IL-16 in CNS of EAE mice was observed.\nThroughout the course of relapsing EAE in both strains of\nmice, IL-16 proteins of 80, 55 and 17 kDa were upregulated\nduring clinically active disease (acute, relapse and chronic).\nAt each examined stage of the disease, F1 and B6 mice with\nsimilar day post immunization (dpi) clinical grade and dura-\ntion of symptoms were compared. Generally, B6 mice had de-\nlayed onset of EAE compared to F1 mice (15 vs. 9), and lower\nmean severity scores at onset (3C- vs. 4C-), similar to find-\nings we reported previously [8]. In order to assure fair compar-\nison between two strains of mice, which distinctly regulate\ntheir immune responses to MOG35e55, the priority was given\nto similarities in clinical scores, which reflected severity of\ndisease, rather than the day of onset. Mice with severity scores\ndifferent more than one grade on the scale of 1e6 were not\ncompared. At acute and relapsing stages a correlation between\nlevels of IL-16 and severity was not observed.\n\nTemporal regulation of the levels of pro-IL-16 in CNS of\nEAE mice followed similar patterns as observed for activated\nIL-16 55 kDa fragment and bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa). In-\ncreased levels of pro-IL-16 were observed in acute, relapsing\nand chronic disease stages. Distinct to levels of activated frag-\nments (55 and 17 kDa), which were highly elevated at acute\nand relapsing disease, levels of pro-IL-16 were markedly in-\ncreased during relapsing and chronic compared to acute dis-\nease. Strain differences in levels of pro-IL-16 were observed\nand were consistent with those described for IL-16 55 and\n17 kDa (see Fig. 1). Overall, (B6 ! SJL) F1 strain contained\nmore pro-IL-16, and produced more activated 55 kDa and\nbioactive (17 kDa) IL-16 throughout the course of relapsing\ndisease compared to B6 strain.\n\n3.5. IL-16 co-immunoprecipitates with CD4\n\nOur data suggest that infiltrating CD4C T cells could pro-\nduce bioactive IL-16 and subsequently release it locally. The\nimportance of such production is linked to the major biological\nfunction of bioactive IL-16, which is CD4C T-cell chemoat-\ntraction. IL-16 binds to CD4 molecule in a ligand-receptor spe-\ncific fashion. IL-16 initiated signaling through CD induces\nspecific chemotaxis of CD4C T cells. By co-immunoprecipita-\ntion experiments, we investigated whether IL-16 and CD4 are\nfunctionally related in the CNS of EAE mice. Co-immunopre-\ncipitation of CD4 and IL-16 is shown in Fig. 8. Total proteins\nwere isolated from spinal cord of a (B6 ! SJL) F1 mouse at\nthird relapse, 68 dpi, with clinical severity score of 4. In two\nseparate experiments, immunoprecipitation was done with\nanti-CD4 and an isotype-matched control antibody. Immuno-\nprecipitated proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and\nblotted onto the membrane. Membranes were probed with\nanti-IL-16 antibody, then stripped and probed with anti-CD4\nantibody. A strong anti-IL-16 specific band corresponding to\n17 kDa fragments, a less intense band corresponding to\n50 kDa fragment and a faint band of approximately 62 kDa\n\n\n\n212 D.S.

Discussion\n\nPrevious work from our laboratory has suggested an impor-\ntant role of IL-16 in regulation of relapsing disease in\n(B6 ! SJL) F1 mice [15]. To better understand the role of\nIL-16 in orchestrating inflammation of the central nervous sys-\ntem (CNS), we extended our previous observations and sought\nanswers to several questions relevant for the regulation of bio-\nactive IL-16 in relapsing EAE. To test our hypothesis that IL-16\nhas a role in regulation of relapsing disease, we examined and\ncompared regulation of IL-16 between two genetically distinct\nstrains of mice, (B6 ! SJL) F1 and the parental B6. Following\nimmunization with MOG35e55 (B6 ! SJL) F1 mice develop\nsevere relapsing-remitting while B6 mice develop low-relaps-\ning disease. In addition these two strains exhibit distinct histo-\npathology of CNS lesions and distinct regulation of their T-cell\nresponses to MOG35e55 [8]. Our data showmajor differences in\nlevels of IL-16 produced in CNS between these two strains of\nmice. In CNS of F1 mice, which consistently develop severe,\nrelapsing-remitting disease, levels of bioactive IL-16 were\nmarkedly higher compared to the low-relapsing B6 strain.\n\nFig. 7. Levels of pro-IL-16 (80 kDa) in CNS of EAE mice were analyzed by\n\nWestern blot. Note upregulation of pro-IL-16 during acute, relapsing and\n\nchronic EAE, similarly as observed for IL-16 (55 kDa) (Fig. 6), and bioactive\n\nIL-16 (17 kDa) (Fig. 1).\nElevation of bioactive IL-16 during acute, relapse and chronic,\nand its clearance from CNS during remission, may suggest its\nparticipation in mechanisms of inflammation, which accompa-\nny stages of clinically manifested disease. Markedly higher lev-\nels of bioactive IL-16 during relapse as compared to acute and\nits persistence in chronic disease further underscored the possi-\nbility that IL-16-mediated mechanisms might be of greater im-\nportance in the regulation of chronic inflammation in CNS, in\nthe relapsing-remitting F1 strain. Throughout the course of re-\nlapsing-remitting EAE, temporal regulation of IL-16 verymuch\nresembles that reported for several chemokines, which are crit-\nically involved in regulation of CNS inflammation, such as\nMCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, and others [24]. While the role of\nchemokines in the orchestration of the initial CNS\n\nFig. 8. IL-16 co-immunoprecipitated with CD4 in CNS from mice with relaps-\n\ning disease. CD4 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-CD4 specific anti-\n\nbody, from total proteins isolated from spinal cord and subjected to Western\n\nblotting using anti-IL-16 antibody. The membrane was then stripped and re-\n\nblotted with anti-CD4 antibody. In a separate, similarly performed experiment,\n\nimmunoprecipitation was done with control antibody, which was isotype-\n\nmatched with anti-CD4 specific antibody. IL-16 specific immunoreactivity\n\nwas not observed with control immunoprecipitates. Blot shows results from\n\nspinal cord of (B6 ! SJL) F1 mouse, at third relapse, 68 dpi, with clinical\n\ngrade of 4.\n\n\n\n213D.S. Skundric et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 25 (2005) 206e214\ninflammation and onset of disease has been clearly established,\nour data imply that bioactive IL-16 may be more important in\nregulating relapsing and chronic stages of disease.\n\nBioactive IL-16 (17 kDa) represents secreted C-terminal\nportion of a larger precursor molecule, pro-IL-16 (80 kDa).\nBy specifically binding and signaling through CD4, bioactive\nIL-16 induces chemoattraction of CD4C cells. The minimal\nC-terminal peptide RRKS (corresponding to Arg106 to Ser109)\nwas shown to be critical for mediating chemoattracting activity\nof mature IL-16 [25]. Active caspase-3 is essential for the cleav-\nage of bioactive IL-16 in activated CD4C T cells [18]. To in-\nvestigate whether CD4C infiltrating T cells may locally\nproduce IL-16, we proceeded to determine levels and regulation\nof active caspase-3 in CNS.We found that both active caspase-3\nand CD4 levels are regulated similarly to bioactive IL-16 in\nCNS of relapsing EAE mice. Similar correlations between lev-\nels of bioactive-IL-16 and active capsase-3 have been demon-\nstrated in thyrocytes, which also require caspase-3 enzymatic\ncleavage of pro-IL-16 in order to produce and secrete IL-16\n[26]. Similarities in patterns of regulation between active cas-\npase-3, CD4 and bioactive IL-16 raised the possibility that ac-\ntive caspase-3 may be contained in CD4C infiltrating cells,\nwhere it may cleave pro-IL-16. Previously, we described\nCD4C IL-16Ccells within inflammatory infiltrates in F1 re-\nlapsing mice [15]. Previously and currently used IL-16 specific\nantibody does not recognize a distinction between pro-IL-16\nand bioactive IL-16. Therefore, it was necessary to investigate\nwhether active caspase-3 and IL-16 immunoreactivity colocal-\nize. We show in Fig. 2 colocalization between IL-16 and active\ncaspase-3 in mononuclear infiltrating cells, further supporting\nthe importance of infiltrating CD4C T cells as a local source\nof bioactive IL-16 in F1 mice. Active caspase-3 immunoreac-\ntivity was not exclusive for IL-16 containingmononuclear cells,\nbut was also observed in some neighboring IL-16- cells. This\nfinding corresponds to observations from other EAE studies re-\nporting the presence of active caspase-3 in oligodendrocytes,\nwhich suggested other potentially important roles, such as apo-\nptosis of oligodendrocytes [27]. Finding significantly higher\nlevels of CD4 protein in CNS of mice with severe relapsing-\nremitting disease (F1), compared to low-relapsing B6 mice,\nwas consistent with our previously reported differences in rela-\ntive numbers of infiltrating CD4C T cells [8]. Although our\ndata support the role of CD4C T cells in producing bioactive\nIL-16 in CNS of EAE mice, we expect that some other cell phe-\nnotypes could also elaborate and locally release IL-16. We have\nshown IL-16-immunoreactive B220C B cells and CD8C\nT cells but not Mac-3C macrophage/microglia in CNS of F1\nrelapsing mice [15]. Presence of IL-16 has been reported in\nmicroglia in one rat EAE model, although it was not made clear\nwhether this was pro-IL-16 or bioactive IL-16, and if so mech-\nanisms of its production have not been addressed [28]. Potential\nof other infiltrating and resident CNS cells to produce IL-16 in\n(B6 ! SJL) F1 EAEmice is currently being investigated in our\nlaboratory (Skundric, unpublished data). In this paper we show\ndata relevant for production of IL-16 by CD4C T cells, because\nthese cells represent the major infiltrating phenotype in relaps-\ning F1 mice differently than in B6, where macrophage\ninfiltration predominates. The importance of CD4C T-cell-de-\nrived IL-16 for relapsing disease is further supported by recent\nfindings from several laboratories that reactivation of CD4C T\ncells within the CNS compartment rather than in the periphery\nrepresents one of the crucial mechanisms of relapse regulation\nin mice [29].\n\nDespite the site of reactivation in both B6 and SJL strains of\nmice, autoreactive and other non-specifically activated CD4C\nT cells recirculate between CNS and peripheral lymphoid\norgans throughout the course of relapsing-remitting disease\n[30,31]. To advance our understanding of IL-16 production\nby activated T cells, not only in CNS but also in peripheral lym-\nphoid organs, we analyzed IL-16 and active caspase-3 regula-\ntion in inguinal lymph nodes and spleens from mice with\nrelapsing EAE. In peripheral lymphoid organs of mice with\nrelapsing and chronic EAE, we detected elevated levels of\nprocessed IL-16 (55 kDa), bioactive IL-16 (17 kDa), and active\ncaspase-3. This data suggest that activated lymphocytes,\nincluding CD4C T cells, serve as sources of bioactive IL-16.\nSimilar to our findings, the presence of processed forms of\nIL-16 ranging from 32 kDa to 78 kDa have been reported in\nactivated CD4C T cells in vitro, and in vivo at the site of\ndelayed-type hypersensitivity reaction [32,33]. To investigate\nfurther whether CD4C T cells activated in either non-specific\nor antigen-specific manner produce bioactive IL-16 in a cas-\npase-3 specific manner, we isolated T cells from regional lymph\nnodes of (B6 ! SJL) F1 mice immunized with MOG35e55. We\ndetected production of IL-16 (17 and 55 kDa) and elevation of\nactive caspase-3, following either polyclonal activation or\nrestimulation with cognate antigen in vitro.\n\nAnother important question that we addressed was whether\nbiological function of elevated bioactive IL-16 in CNS of mice\nwith relapsing EAE was to provide a chemoattractant signal\nfor CD4C T cells. To examine whether IL-16 functionally re-\nlates to CD4 in CNS, we performed co-immunoprecipitation\nexperiments. Data from those experiments revealed that IL-\n16 (17 kDa, 50e60 kDa) co-immunoprecipitated with CD4,\nwhich suggested a functional relationship between IL-16 and\nCD4 in CNS. Our data are consistent with recently published\nstudies showing an association between the cleaved C-terminus\nand intracellular N-terminus of IL-16 with CD4 co-receptor or\nwith kinases activated through TCR/CD4 signaling events\n[19,20]. This observed relationship between IL-16 (17 kDa)\nand CD4 in CNS of mice with EAE further supports the role\nof bioactive IL-16 in CD4C T-cell chemoattraction.\n\nOverall, we demonstrate an elevated production of bioactive\nIL-16, which corresponds to increased activation of caspase-3\nand massive infiltration by CD4C T cells in CNS of\n(B6 ! SJL) F1 mice with severe relapsing disease. We show\nsimilar patterns of regulation for IL-16 and active caspase-3 in\nperipheral lymphoid organs of relapsing EAE mice, and in T\ncells isolated from lymph nodes following T-cell activation in\nvitro. Finally, we provide evidence of a functional relationship\nbetween CD4 and IL-16 proteins in CNS, suggesting that\none of the important roles of locally produced IL-16 may be in\nchemoattraction of additional waves of CD4C T cells. We pro-\npose that infiltrating CD4CT cells serve as an important source\n\n\n\n214 D.S.
