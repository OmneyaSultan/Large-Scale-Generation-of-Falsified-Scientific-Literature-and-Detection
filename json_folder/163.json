Raman\nAim: Increased production of cytokines and chemokines in serum and tissues upon oxidative stress\ncaused by severe systemic infections are the major cause of sepsis. Aldose reductase (AR) known to medi-\nate oxidative stress-induced NF-jB activation and transcription of cytokines and chemokines are the\nmain mediator of bacterial endotoxin-induced inflammatory response. Our aim is to investigate the effect\nof AR inhibitors on the prevention of inflammatory cytokines in the cecum ligation and puncture (CLP)\nmodel of polymicrobial sepsis which closely mimics the sepsis syndrome in humans. Results: Mice were\nrendered septic by CLP in the absence and presence of AR inhibitor, sorbinil. The levels of cytokines, che-\nmokines and other inflammatory markers in the plasma, peritoneal fluid and heart of mice were signif-\nicantly inhibited by sorbinil. Inhibition of AR also prevented CLP-induced COX-2, iNOS and HMGB-1 in\nheart, kidney and spleen. Conclusions: Our results showed that the inhibition of AR significantly prevented\nthe polymicrobial sepsis-induced increase in inflammatory markers and thus indicate the use of AR inhib-\nitors as anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\ufffd 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This disease is characterized by whole-body\ninflammation due to severe systemic infection [2]. Severely burnt\npatients usually develop sepsis which is the major cause of death\nif not aggressively and timely treated [3]. In the United States\nalone, sepsis is the second leading cause of death in non-coronary\nintensive care unit patients [4], which account for 20\u201350% deaths\nper year out of 660,000 affected cases [5]. Despite significant ad-\nvances in the understanding of pathogenesis of sepsis and its com-\nplications, barely a small number of restorative strategies have\nbeen employed that could decrease mortality associated with sep-\ntic shock. Although sepsis is generally initiated by a bacterial infec-\ntion, the pathogenesis of sepsis is characterized by increased levels\nof inflammatory markers such as cytokines and chemokines that\ncould lead to severe complications such as multiorgan failure and\ndeath [6]. Eventhough the treatment with broad range antibiotics\nis generally effective in killing the replicating bacteria, the dead\nbacterial cell wall components act as bacterial toxins which cause\noverwhelming systemic inflammatory response [7]. Thus control-\nll rights reserved.\n\nBiochemistry and Molecular\nBSB, Galveston, TX 77555,\n\na).\nling bacterial infection is not sufficient to treat sepsis. It is rather\nimportant to neutralize the immunogenic signals that activate\ntranscription factors that transcribe inflammatory markers.\nAlthough several new therapeutic strategies have been described\nin the literature for the treatment of sepsis to date, various anti-\ninflammatory strategies have produced only modest therapeutic\neffects in critically ill sepsis patients [8].\n\nRecently, we have shown that the treatment with aldose\nreductase (AR) inhibitors results in profoundly improved survival\nin the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced endotoximia in mice [9].\nThe observed improvement in survival after treatment with AR\ninhibitors or AR-siRNA was associated with restoration of cardiac\nmuscle contractility and cardiac functions. We have demonstrated\nthat a significant increase in the levels of serum as well as heart\ncytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory markers such as\nCOX-2, iNOS and PGE2 in LPS-treated mice which significantly\ncontributes to pathophysiology of sepsis, was markedly prevented\nby AR inhibition [9]. Also inhibition of AR prevented the endo-\ntoxin, high glucose and TNF-a induced increase in the redox-sen-\nsitive transcription factors, NF-jB and AP-1, which are known to\ntranscribe various inflammatory markers [9\u201315]. These results\nsuggest that AR inhibitors, developed as anti-diabetic drugs, could\nbe used as therapeutic intervention to prevent sepsis [16]. AR\ninhibitors such as zopolrestat, fidarestat have been found to be\nsafe and passed in FDA\u2019s phase-II and clinical trials for diabetic\nneuropathy but failed in phase-III clinical trials as they have been\nshown to be not as effective. There are several AR inhibitors such\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2009.07.004\nmailto:kvramana@utmb.edu\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\nA.B.M. Reddy et al. / Cytokine 48 (2009) 170\u2013176 171\nas ranirestat that are still undergoing phase-III trails for diabetic\nneuropathy. An AR inhibitor, epalrestat is available in Japan\nmainly to treat patients with diabetic neuropathy [16,17]. Our re-\ncent results demonstrate that AR inhibitors could be used thera-\npeutically for inflammatory disorders other than diabetic\ncomplications [15,18]. For such use a careful examination of the\neffect of AR inhibition in clinically relevant animal models is\nmandatory. In the present study, we investigated whether treat-\nment with AR inhibitors could prevent alterations in the cytokine\nand chemokine levels in a clinically more relevant model that\nmimics sepsis conditions in humans. Our results indicate that\nAR inhibitor is a powerful repressor of the expression of major\ncytokines and chemokines in a mouse model of polymicrobial\nsepsis indicating its use as potential anti-inflammatory agent in\nsepsis and associated complications.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nAntibodies against COX-2, iNOS p65-NF-jB and HMGB-1 were\npurchased from Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibod-\nies against AR were custom raised and tested for specificity. Mouse\nspecific ELISA kits for cytokines were purchased from BD biosci-\nences (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cytokine antibody array was purchased\nfrom RayBiotech, Inc. (Norcross, GA). Sorbinil was gift from Pfizer\n(Groton, CT). ACTICHROME\ufffd Tissue factor activity assay kit was\npurchased from American diagnostic Inc (Stamford, CT), Tramadol\nHydrochloride from Mallinckrodt Inc. (St. Louis, MO). All other re-\nagents were of the highest purity available.\n2.2. Cecim ligation and puncture procedure\n\nBALB/c female mice (19\u201323 g) were obtained from Jackson lab-\noratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed with regular diet and ambi-\nence for 48 h before recruiting to the study. The animals were\nmaintained in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of\nLaboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health\nand in accordance with the Institute\u2019s \u2018\u2018Guideline of the Animal\nCare and Use Committee\u201d. Using previously described method\n[19] CLP procedure was performed by anesthetizing the mice with\nketamine (60 lg/g) and xylazine (10 lg/g) and a 2-cm midline inci-\nsion was made through the linea alba. The cecum was located, li-\ngated with sterile 3\u20130, silk, and perforated with double puncture\nusing a 18-gauge needle. A small amount of stool was extruded\nto ensure wound potency. Sham-treated mice also had surgery\ndone along with cecal manipulations but without ligation and\npuncture. The cecum was then replaced in its original position\nwithin the abdomen, and incision was immediately closed. Soon\nafter surgery, each mouse received a subcutaneous injection of\n1 ml of warm (37 \ufffdC) normal saline with traMADOL hydrochloride\n(20 lg/g body wt). To inhibit AR, mice received 25 mg/kg body wt\nsorbinil 2 h after surgery and then 6 h after surgery. All mice (5 in\neach group) were kept at 22 \ufffdC and killed after 14 h of surgery.\nBlood was collected from the heart in EDTA-coated tubes. Plasma\nwas separated from cellular components by centrifugation at\n600g for 5 min and stored at \ufffd20 \ufffdC. For peritoneal lavage, 2 cm\nskin was removed leaving the peritoneal membrane intact. Then\n1 ml of ice-cold 1\ufffd Hanks balanced salt solution (without CaCl2,\nMgCl2, Mg2SO4, and phenol red; GIBCO) was injected using 26\ngauge needle. After injection, peritoneum was gently palpated for\n30 s, and peritoneal fluid was aspirated out using a 20 gauge nee-\ndle. The fluid was centrifuged (600g, 5 min), and the supernatant\nwas stored at \ufffd20 \ufffdC. Heart and aorta tissues were collected and\nstored at \ufffd70 \ufffdC for tissue homogenates.\n\n2.3. Measurement of cytokines in plasma\n\nMice after 14 h of surgery were euthanized and blood was col-\nlected into EDTA-coated vacutainers by heart puncture. plasma\nwas separated by centrifugation at 600g for 5 min. Levels of IL-\n1b, IL-6, TNF-a and MCP-1 in the plasma were measured by using\nrespective mouse specific ELISA kits according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s instructions. Known concentrations of standards were used\nto generate the standard curves. The reaction was initiated by the\naddition of 0.1 ml of the serum, stopped and read at 450 nm on an\nELISA plate reader. The results obtained are expressed as pg/ml of\nthe plasma.\n\n2.4. Measurement of cytokines and chemokines in heart\n\nTo measure the expression of cytokines and chemokines in\nheart tissue homogenates, we used commercially available RayBio\nMouse cytokine antibody array system that determines the expres-\nsion of 64 inflammatory markers from a single sample by following\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. In-brief, 100 lg heart tissue homoge-\nnates were incubated with array support membrane where the\nmembrane was specifically coated with antigens to capture an ar-\nray of cytokines. The tagged proteins were detected by conjugating\nwith biotinylated antibodies and streptavidin system. Fold change\nwas calculated from the measured intensities of the individual\nspots signal developed on X-ray film using Kodak-densitometry\nsoftware.\n\n2.5. Western blot analysis\n\nTo examine the effect of AR inhibition on CLP-induced expres-\nsion of COX-2, iNOS, AR, NF-jB and HMGB-1 we homogenized\nheart, spleen and kidney tissues obtained from euthanized mice\nafter 14 h of CLP procedure. Equal amount of protein from homog-\nenates were subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE and Western blotting and\nmembranes were probed for against specific antibodies AR, iNOS,\npP65-NF-jB, COX-2, HMG-1 (HMGB-1) and GAPDH. The antigen\u2013\nantibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemilumines-\ncence (Pierce, Rockford, IL). All blots were probed with GAPDH as\na loading control and densitometric analysis was carried out by\nusing Kodak Image station.\n\n2.6. Tissue factor assay\n\nTissue factor was measured in mice plasma by using ACTI-\nCHROME\ufffd Tissue factor activity assay kit from American diagnostic\nInc. by following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. In-brief After the exper-\nimental procedure mice plasma were collected as described in\nmethods and the reaction was initiated by adding equal amount\nof plasma to reaction mixture containing lapidated tissue factor,\nfactor VIII and factor X, allowing to form complex with fVIIa to gen-\nerate TF/fVIIa complexes and convert fX into fXa. fXa cleaves the\nchromogenic substrate and the formation of color is measured by\nreading absorbance at 409 nm using micro well plate reader.\nAmount of tissue factor in the sample were calculated using the\nstandards. The results obtained were measured in pMoles.\n\n2.7. Statistical analysis\n\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and the p values were deter-\nmined using the one-way ANOVA and unpaired Student\u2019s t-test.\n\n\n\n172 A.B.M. Reddy et al. / Cytokine 48 (2009) 170\u2013176\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Prevention of CLP-induced increase in plasma and peritoneal\ncytokines by AR inhibition\n\nTo investigate the effect of AR inhibition on polymicrobial infec-\ntion-induced inflammatory response, we performed CLP-surgery on\nmice injected without or with AR inhibitor, sorbinil. Increased red-\nness around the cecum caused by increased blood flow due to dila-\ntory expansion of microcirculatory blood vessels observed in the\nCLP operated mice was prevented by AR inhibitor (Fig. 1). The plasma\nand peritoneal fluids were collected 14 h after CLP procedure and\nanalyzed for cytokines and chemokines. The plasma and peritoneal\nfluid levels of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a and MCP-1 proteins in sham-oper-\nated controls were low but detectable (Fig. 2A\u2013D, left panel). How-\never in the CLP mice the plasma levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and\nMCP-1 increased by approximately \ufffd0.8-, 37-, 11- and 10-folds,\nrespectively (Fig. 2A\u2013D, left panel). On the other hand, administra-\ntion of sorbinil to the CLP mice significantly (\ufffd45\u201380%) prevented\nthe increase in the plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines. Sim-\nilarly, in CLP mice the peritoneal fluid levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and\nMCP-1 increased by 5.2-, 31-, 10- and 5-folds, respectively (Fig. 2A\u2013\nD, right panel) and administration of sorbinil to the CLP mice signif-\nicantly (\ufffd40\u201370%) prevented the increase in cytokine levels. AR\ninhibitors alone had no effect on the basal levels of these cytokines\nand chemokines in plasma or peritoneal fluid. Further, the measure-\nment of inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6) in the ser-\num at 3 h after CLP-surgery did not cause any increase in the\ncytokine levels as compared to controls and AR inhibitor treated\nmice (data not shown). These results suggest that AR inhibition\ncould prevent polymicrobial infection-induced systemic production\nof inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mice.\n\n3.2. Prevention of CLP-induced increase in tissue cytokines by AR\ninhibition\n\nSince increased cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyopathy due\nto augmented local production of inflammatory cytokines and\nFig. 1. AR inhibition prevents CLP-induced redness around the wound: after 14 h of CLP\npictures were taken immediately after the opening of wound. The region showing redn\nchemokines are the major cause of mortality and morbidity ob-\nserved in patients with sepsis [20], we specifically examined\nthe effect of AR inhibition on CLP-induced cytokines and che-\nmokines in the mice hearts. We used an antibody array that\ndetermines the expression of 64 cytokines and chemokines\nand other inflammatory markers from a single sample\n(Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3, the levels of MIP-2, MIP-1 and\nlymphotoxin increased by \ufffd6-fold in CLP mice group whereas\nthe increase was only \ufffd3-fold in case of CLP + sorbinil group.\nSimilarly the levels of other cytokines and chemokines were\nsignificantly elevated in CLP group of mice and administration\nof AR inhibitor significantly prevented these cytokines and che-\nmokines (Fig. 3B).\n\nWe next determined the effect of AR inhibition on the CLP-in-\nduced levels of inflammatory markers COX-2, iNOS and HMGB-1\nin heart, spleen and kidney homogenates by Western blot anal-\nysis (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4A and B, polymicrobial sepsis\ncaused \ufffd3.5-, \ufffd2.5-fold induction of COX-2 and iNOS respec-\ntively which was significantly (\ufffd90%) prevented by the adminis-\ntration of AR inhibitor. Similarly in CLP mice tissue homogenates,\na significant increase in AR protein was observed and inhibitors\nof AR prevented CLP-induced increase in the expression of AR\nprotein (Fig. 4C). Since the expression of cytokines and chemo-\nkines, COX-2, iNOS and AR depends on the activation of NF-jB,\nwe next measured the activated form of NF-jB in mice heart,\nspleen and kidney homogenates. As shown in Fig. 4D the CLP-in-\nduced activation of NF-jB in mice tissue homogenates was sig-\nnificantly prevented by AR inhibition. Since activated\nmacrophages and monocytes secrete HMGB-1 protein which acts\nas a mediator of inflammation [21], we next measured the effect\nof AR inhibition on the expression of HMGB-1. As shown in\nFig. 4E, increased expression of HMGB-1 protein was observed\nin CLP tissues as compared to sham controls and ARI treatment\nsignificantly prevented CLP-induced HMGB-1. These results sug-\ngested that AR inhibition could prevent CLP-induced inflamma-\ntion by inhibiting redox-sensitive transcription factor, NF-jB \u2013\ndependent expression of various inflammatory markers such as\ncytokines and chemokines.\n, mice were killed and wound was accessed for severity of the inflammation.

(A) IL-1b, (B) IL-6, (C) TNF-a and (D)\nMCP-1 were measured in both plasma and in peritoneal fluid using mouse specific ELISA kits as described in Section 2.

Reddy et al. / Cytokine 48 (2009) 170\u2013176 173\n3.3. Prevention of CLP-induced activation of plasmatissue factor by AR\ninhibition\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the use of anti-coagulants\nwould be beneficial in preserving platelets and organ functions in\nendotoxemia-model via mechanisms involving inactivation of tis-\nsue factor, which plays a critical role in the initiation of complex\nmechanisms in the process of blood clot which causes organ dys-\nfunction [22]. We therefore, measured the activation of tissue fac-\ntor in CLP mice plasma. Our results (Fig. 5) show that tissue factor\nactivity was much higher in CLP group as compared to CLP + ARI\ngroup of mice as well as sham-operated control mice indicating\nthat inhibition of AR could prevent secretion of tissue factor.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nPolymicrobial sepsis is a serious medical condition character-\nized by shock, hypoxemia, and organ dysfunction and dissemi-\nnated intravascular coagulation [1,23]. Although subjects of all\nage groups upon severe bacterial infections can get sepsis, higher\nmortality has been observed in overweight, older age, intubated\nand immunocompromised patients [5]. Severe sepsis results from\nthe body\u2019s systemic over-response to infection that disrupts\nhomeostasis through an uncontrolled cascade of inflammation\n[24], blood coagulation and impaired fibriolysis [21]. Even though\ncontrolling bacterial infections by aggressive antibiotics therapy\nand maintaining homeostasis in immune response saves a num-\nber of lives, 20\u201325% patients die because of multiorgan failure\n[4,5,25]. Although precise mechanism(s) of multiorgan failure is\nnot clearly understood, several clinical models have been devel-\noped to investigate the mechanism(s) involved in sepsis patho-\ngenesis [26]. Among them, CLP-model has been shown to\nclosely replicate the nature and course of clinical sepsis. This\nmodel is highly reproducible and widely used to study the mech-\naninsm(s) of multiorgan failure as well as for testing the efficacy\nof drugs [27].\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Inhibition of AR prevents inflammatory cytokines in mice hearts: after 14 h of CLP, mice hearts were dissected out and homogenates were made.

Reddy et al. / Cytokine 48 (2009) 170\u2013176 175\nUncontrolled generation of proinflammatory cytokines and che-\nmokines has been noted in experimental models of sepsis as well\nas in clinical settings. Early release of macrophage-derived proin-\nflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and MCP-1 have\nbeen shown to be important in the pathogenesis of septic shock\nand multiorgan failure [28\u201331]. In our study, AR inhibitor adminis-\ntration resulted in a significant decrease in these proinflammatory\ncytokines not only in the plasma and peritoneal fluids but in the\nheart as well. Thus the ability of AR inhibited mice to produce less\ninflammatory cytokines in response to CLP-induced sepsis could\nindicate the potential use of AR inhibitors in prevention of sepsis\nand its associated complications. It is well known that under oxida-\ntive stress-induced by infections, bacterial toxins and during vari-\nous pathological conditions NF-jB is significantly activated which\nregulates the expression of genes involved in inflammatory re-\nsponses [10,18]. The mechanisms by which AR inhibition exerts\nan inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokine levels may in-\nvolve the suppression of NF-jB activity [11,29]. In fact, several re-\nports suggest that inhibition of NF-jB could prevent inflammatory\nresponse observed in sepsis. For example, anti-oxidants such as N-\nacetylcystene, ascorbic acid, and a-tocopherol [32\u201335] which pre-\nvent the activation of ROS-induced NF-jB have been shown to pro-\ntect animals and humans from septic shock. We have recently\nshown that AR inhibitors which act like anti-oxidants and prevent\nbacterial endotoxin, LPS- induced generation of ROS prevent the\nactivation of NF-jB and the expression of inflammatory markers\nin macrophages as well as in mice serum [9,12\u201314]. We have\nshown that AR-catalyzed reduced products of lipid aldehyde gluta-\nthione conjugates such as GS-DHN could mediate the signaling\npathway that eventually increases transcription of inflammatory\nmarkers in vascular smooth muscle cells and other cells [14]. The\nincreased cytokines, chemokines and growth factors subsequently\ninitiate the signal transduction pathways that result in increased\nsecretion of inflammatory markers which cause inflammation\nand multiorgan failure. Our cellular studies using vascular smooth\nmuscle cells, vascular endothelial cells and macrophages have\ndemonstrated that ROS-induced NF-jB activation and transcrip-\ntion of inflammatory markers such as TNF-a, IL-1b, COX-2 and\niNOS can be prevented by inhibiting AR [10\u201315]. In the present\nstudy also our results indicate that the release of bacteria into\nthe peritoneum by CLP procedure causes a significant increase in\nvarious inflammatory markers in the peritoneal fluid which is sig-\nnificantly prevented by AR inhibitor. Since several of the AR inhib-\nitors have been found to be safe and have already been studied for\nphase-1 and phase-2 clinical trails for diabetic neuropathy [16,17],\nthe use of AR inhibitors as anti-inflammatory drug would be less\ntime consuming and if found as effective in humans as in experi-\nmental model of sepsis, they could be used therapeutically in the\ninflammatory disorder patients. In summary, our results suggest\nthat the AR inhibition has anti-inflammatory effects in murine\nmodel of sepsis. Further studies are required to use AR inhibition\nas an excellent therapeutic approach to treat sepsis especially\nthose patients in which antibiotics though kill the bacteria, the cir-\n\n\n\n176 A.B.M.
