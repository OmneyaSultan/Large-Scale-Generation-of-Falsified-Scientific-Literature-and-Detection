To address this issue, we depleted thePar3 polarity gene by RNAi in combi-\nnation with oncogenic Notch or Ras61L expression in the murine mammary gland. Par3 silencing dramatically\nreduced tumor latency in both models and produced invasive and metastatic tumors that retained epithelial\nmarker expression. Par3 depletion was associated with induction of MMP9, destruction of the extracellular\nmatrix, and invasion, all mediated by atypical PKC-dependant JAK/Stat3 activation. Importantly, Par3\nexpression is significantly reduced in human breast cancers, which correlates with active aPKC and Stat3.\nThese data identify Par3 as a regulator of signaling pathways relevant to invasive breast cancer.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMost solid tumors arise from epithelial cells that have acquired\n\nchanges in proliferative and organizational capacity. Epithelial\n\ncells form characteristic intercellular adhesions and possess\n\napical-basal polarity, which is lost in some invasive and meta-\n\nstatic cancers in a process related to the epithelial-mesenchymal\n\ntransitions (EMTs) that occur during development (Thiery et al.,\n\n2009). However, in many cases, epithelial features are retained.\n\nHow epithelial tissues establish their organization in a normal\n\nstate and how this organization is disrupted during cancer\n\nprogression are still not well understood. In particular, it is largely\n\nunknown if the cell polarity machinery is perturbed during tumor-\n\nigenesis and if such disruptions promote metastasis.\n\nMany of the polarity protein complexes localize to distinct\n\ndomains within the plasma membrane. The Par genes (Par1,\n\nPar3, Par4, Par5, Par6, and atypical PKC [aPKC]) encode an\n\nevolutionarily conserved group of polarity proteins that play\n\nkey roles in many aspects of cell polarization (Goldstein and\n\nMacara, 2007). To date and to our knowledge, only Par4, a\n\nprotein kinase also known as LKB1, has been identified as\n\na tumor suppressor (Jansen et al., 2009), and it remains uncer-\nSignificance\n\nAlthough loss of cell polarity is often considered a hallmark of i\nrole of the polaritymachinery in tumor suppression.

We find that expression o\nphospho-Stat3, and MMP9 expression in human breast cance\nsuppressor.\n\nCan\ntain if tumorigenesis in patients with mutant LKB1 is caused by\n\nloss of its polarity function.\n\nWe have focused on Par3, a multidomain scaffolding protein\n\nrequired for the spatial organization of several important sig-\n\nnaling proteins (Goldstein and Macara, 2007). Par3 is essential\n\nfor the delivery of aPKC to the apical surface (Harris and Peifer,\n\n2005; McCaffrey and Macara, 2009), through binding of Par3 to\n\nthe adaptor protein Par6, which forms a constitutive complex\n\nwith aPKC. Furthermore, aPKC can interact directly with Par3,\n\nwhich is essential for apical aPKC localization and epithelial\n\norganization (Horikoshi et al., 2009; McCaffrey and Macara,\n\n2009). Loss of aPKC from the apical cortex causes spindle\n\npole orientation defects and epithelial mis-organization (Hao\n\net al., 2010). Both the level of aPKC expression and mislo-\n\ncalization correlate with increased invasion and metastasis in\n\nbreast cancer (Kojima et al., 2008). However, to our knowledge,\n\nwhether loss of Par3 has a role in regulating aPKC during tumor-\n\nigenesis is unknown.\n\nSome proteins have oncogenic activity when overexpressed.\n\nThe Notch receptor, an important transcriptional regulator of\n\nstem cell fate, is activated by proteolytic cleavage to release\n\nan intracellular domain (NICD), which is found at elevated levels\nnvasive cancers, there is little experimental evidence for any\nmonstrate that Par3 polarity protein expression is frequently\nnes, loss of Par3 increases primary tumor growth andmeta-\ndownstream of Jak/Stat3 signaling, which is responsible for\nf Par3 is anticorrelated with phospho-aPKC, phospho-JAK,\nrs, establishing Par3 as a potent tumor growth and invasion\n\ncer Cell 22, 601\u2013614, November 13, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 601\n\nmailto:luke.mccaffrey@mcgill.ca\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2012.10.003\n\n\nCancer Cell\n\nPar3 Is a Tumor Invasion Suppressor\nin up to 50% of human breast cancers (Pece et al., 2004); and\n\nmammary-specific expression of NICD in mice induces breast\n\ntumors, though with no metastasis (Hu et al., 2006). Additionally,\n\nenhanced growth factor receptor signaling promotes breast\n\ncancer. A central effector of growth factor receptor signaling is\n\nthe Ras oncogene, which, although rarely mutated in breast\n\ncancer, is frequently hyperactivated (Clark and Der, 1995).\n\nElevated expression of Neu/ErbB2 or Met receptors is observed\n\nin 20%\u201330%and 15%\u201320%of breast cancers, respectively, and\n\ncan inappropriately stimulate Ras-mediated signaling pathways\n\n(Reese and Slamon, 1997; Ponzo and Park, 2010).\n\nProgression of in situ breast carcinomas to metastatic disease\n\nrequires additional steps, and it is now established that\n\ninflammation is necessary for this process (Grivennikov and\n\nKarin, 2008). Stat3 has a central role in regulating inflammation\n\nin breast cancer through a cytokine loop involving IL-6 (Grivenni-\n\nkov and Karin, 2008; Schafer and Brugge, 2007). Stat3 is Tyr\n\nphosphorylated by Src or JAK kinases, which induces transloca-\n\ntion to the nucleus. Stat3 can be hyperactivated in breast\n\ncancers, which promotes invasion and metastasis, although\n\nStat3 activation alone is insufficient to induce tumorigenesis\n\n(Barbieri et al., 2010b; Ranger et al., 2009). Therefore, many of\n\nthe processes that drive tumorigenesis andmetastasis are sepa-\n\nrable, but how they relate to tissue organization is not well\n\nunderstood.\n\nThe goal of this study was to determine the role of the apical-\n\nbasal cell polarity machinery in tumorigenesis, with a focus on\n\nthe Par3 polarity protein. Using a mouse mammary transplant\n\nmodel coupled with lentiviral transduction, we silenced Par3\n\nexpression in the context of two different oncogenes and deter-\n\nmined whether loss of Par3 drives tumor growth and/or metas-\n\ntasis. The expression of Par3 was also examined in human\n\nbreast cancers.\n\nRESULTS\n\nLoss of Par3 Cooperates with NICD to Promote\nTumorigenesis\nWe used lentiviral RNAi to deplete Par3 from primary mammary\n\nepithelial cells (MECs) and transplanted them orthotopically into\n\nthe inguinal (#4) mammary fat pads of syngeneic mice. Previ-\n\nously, we reported that Par3-depletedmammary progenitor cells\n\nform disorganized ductal outgrowths that resemble early ductal\n\ncarcinoma in situ (DCIS) (McCaffrey and Macara, 2009). How-\n\never, over a period of 24\u201337 weeks post-transplantation, Par3\n\ndepletion did not lead to tumor formation (Figure 1A), suggesting\n\nthat Par3 is not a classical tumor suppressor. Next, we asked\n\nwhether loss of Par3might enhance tumorigenesis in the context\n\nof an oncogene. We initially used NICD, which is upregulated in\n\n\ufffd50% of human breast cancers (Pece et al., 2004) and drives\ntumor formation in mice after a latency of \ufffd9 months (Hu et al.,\n2006). Primary MECs isolated from C3H mice were transduced\n\nwith lentivirus that expresses active, myc-tagged NICD plus\n\nsmall hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to either Luciferase (control) or\n\nmurine Par3, using Par3 shRNA that we had validated previously\n\n(McCaffrey andMacara, 2009).We refer to the transducedMECs\n\nas NICD/shLuc and NICD/shPar3, respectively. For each animal,\n\n10,000 NICD/shLuc or NICD/shPar3 MECs were injected into\n\ncontralateral inguinal (#4) fat pads of the same mouse. Immuno-\n602 Cancer Cell 22, 601\u2013614, November 13, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc\nblots of tissue lysates showed that myc-NICD was expressed in\n\nthe tumors and that Par3 silencing was efficient (Figure 1B).\n\nStrikingly, loss of Par3 caused a dramatic reduction in tumor\n\nlatency for NICD-transduced MECs, with 50% of NICD/shPar3\n\nanimals developing tumors by 18 weeks (Figure 1A). We con-\n\nfirmed that tumors were derived from cells expressing both\n\nNICD and shPar3 by imaging the GFP marker for the RNAi lenti-\n\nvirus and by staining for myc-NICD (Figures 1C and 1D).\n\nWe transplanted NICD/shLuc and NICD/shPar3 MECs into\n\nopposite sides of the same mouse, and palpable NICD/shLuc\n\ntumors were rarely formed when mice were sacrificed due to\n\nthe NICD/shPar3 tumor burden. However, in some cases, small\n\nNICD/shLuc tumors were found by microscopic examination\n\nof the mammary fat pads (Figure 1D). Consistently, all tumors\n\nwere GFP positive, and tumors derived from NICD/shPar3\n\nMECs were much larger than those from the NICD/shLuc\n\nMECs (Figure 1D). Moreover, whereas NICD/shLuc tumors pos-\n\nsessed well-defined boundaries, the loss of Par3 induced a\n\nmore invasive phenotype, with cells protruding into the sur-\n\nrounding fat pad (Figure 1E). Both types of tumors retained\n\nepithelial characteristics, including expression of cytokeratin 8,\n\nE-cadherin at intercellular junctions and the tight junction marker\n\nZO1 at apicolateral boundaries surrounding microlumens\n\n(Figures 1E and 1F). We further examined cellular organization\n\nby staining tumor sections for cytokeratin 8 (K8) and cytokeratin\n\n14 (K14). In normal murine mammary ducts, K14 is expressed\n\nin myoepithelial cells, whereas K8 is restricted to luminal cells\n\n(see Figure S1 available online). Loss of Par3 increased tumor\n\ncell heterogeneity in our NICD model (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1).\n\nNICD/shLuc tumors were homogeneous and predominantly\n\nK8+K14moderate, but the NICD/shPar3 tumors displayed a sub-\n\nstantially greater degree of cellular diversity.\n\nLoss of Par3 Cooperates with Oncogenic H-Ras to\nPromote Tumorigenesis\nTo determine if the promotion of tumor growth by loss of\n\nPar3 is specific to NICD or is of more general importance, we\n\nasked if Par3 depletion cooperates with a different oncogene,\n\nH-Ras61L. Knockdown of Par3 in conjunction with oncogenic\n\nGFP-tagged Ras61L significantly reduced tumor latency com-\n\npared to GFP-Ras61L alone (Figure 2A). Palpable Ras61L/shPar3\n\ntumors had an average latency of 114 \u00b1 68 days compared to\n\nRas61L/shLuc, which had a latency of >230 days. By 37 weeks,\n\n92%of Ras61L/shLuc transplant mice remained tumor-free com-\n\npared to 54% Ras61L/shPar3 transplant mice (Figure 2A). We\n\nconfirmed comparable Ras expression levels and efficient Par3\n\nknockdown by immunoblotting tumor lysates (Figure 2B).\n\nAlthough both Ras61L/shLuc and Ras61L/shPar3 tumors ex-\n\npressed GFP and were able to grow to comparable sizes (Fig-\n\nure 2C), Ras61L/shPar3 tumors grew more rapidly and were\n\nconsistently more aggressive than Ras61L/shLuc tumors; they\n\ninvaded through the peritoneum, with the bulk of the tumors\n\ngrowing inside the body cavity, and were not detected during\n\npalpation (Figure S2A). Additionally, \ufffd30% of the Ras61L/\nshPar3 tumors invaded through the skin (data not shown).\n\nConsistent with these differences in invasiveness, Ras61L/shLuc\n\ntumors were more organized and retained regions that pos-\n\nsessed a lobular organization with distinct boundaries, whereas\n\nRas61L/shPar3 tumors exhibited no discernable organization,\n.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

In\n\ncontrast, NICD/shPar3 tumors were restricted to the fat pad,\n\nwith occasional invasion into the peritoneum.\n\nRas tumors depleted of Par3 retained expression of ZO1,\n\nwhich remained localized at sites of cell-cell contacts marking\n\nthe boundaries of minilumens (Figure 2D). Unexpectedly, al-\n\nthough Ras61L is concentrated at intercellular junctions in the\n\nRas61L/shLuc tumors, loss of Par3 results in the partial redistri-\n\nbution of the oncoprotein into the cytoplasm (Figure 2D, insets),\n\nwhich might have consequences for downstream signaling. The\n\ntumors also retained expression of the luminal epithelial marker\n\nK8 (Figure 2E), demonstrating that, as with the NICD model,\n\nthe Ras61L tumor cells are disorganized but retain epithelial char-\n\nacteristics in the absence of Par3. The Ras61L/shLuc tumors also\n\nexpressed E-cadherin (Figure 2E). In contrast, however, E-cad-\n\nherin (Figure 2E) and b-catenin (Figure S2B) were almost unde-\n\ntectable in Ras61L/shPar3 tumors. The absence of staining\n\nreflects downregulation of expression rather thanmislocalization\n\n(Figures 2F and S2C). Although Ras61L/shPar3 tumor cells were\nCancer Cell 22, 601\u2013614, N\nmore spindle shaped, there was no\n\nincrease in vimentin, a mesenchymal\n\nmarker (Figure 2F). Thus, loss of Par3,\n\nspecifically in the context of the Ras\n\noncogene, represses E-cadherin expres-\n\nsion, though not the loss of other luminal\n\nepithelial markers.\n\nInterestingly, Ras61L/shLuc tumor cells\n\nwere primarily K8+K14\ufffd, whereas the\nRas61L/shPar3 tumors were more hetero-\n\ngeneous, and included K8+K14\ufffd and\n\nK8+K14+ dual-positive cells (Figure 2E). K8+K14+ dual-positive\n\ncells may be undifferentiated progenitors (Raouf et al., 2008;\n\nShackleton et al., 2006; Villadsen et al., 2007). Together, these\n\ndata are consistent with our previous identification of a role for\n\nPar3 in driving progenitor cell differentiation in the mammary\n\ngland (McCaffrey and Macara, 2009). They also indicate that\n\nloss of Par3 causes tissue mis-organization rather than a simple\n\nloss of apical-basal polarity.\n\nPar3 Acts as an Invasion and Metastasis Suppressor\nTo determine if loss of Par3 promotes metastasis, we examined\n\nthe lungs of mice after orthotopic injection of NICD/shLuc or\n\nNICD/shPar3 into mammary fat pads. None of the NICD/shLuc\n\nmice had lung metastases (n = 14), consistent with published\n\ndata on NICD transgenic mice (Hu et al., 2006). However,\n\n>80% of NICD/shPar3 mice (n = 17) displayed extensive coloni-\n\nzation, with an average of 32 colonies visible per lung (Figures 3A\n\nand 3B). These values are significantly different (p = 0.0001).\n\nImportantly, lung metastases from both NICD/shPar3 and\november 13, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 603\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Previously, loss of\nCancer Cell 22, 601\u2013614, N\nPar3 has been reported to inhibit cell\n\nmigration in two-dimensional scratch\n\nwound assays (Schmoranzer et al.,\n\n2009). The nontransduced cells showed\n\nno detectable invasion through Matrigel\n\npads over the time course of the experi-\n\nment, and silencing of Par3 alone did\n\nnot enable invasion (data not shown).\n\nExpression of either the NICD or Ras61L\n\noncogenes caused a significant number\n\nof cells to penetrate through the Matrigel.\n\nStrikingly, however, the silencing of Par3\n\nin the context of either oncogene caused\n\na substantial increase in invasion effi-\n\nciency. Loss of Par3 caused a 3.5-fold\n\n(NICD) and 3.9-fold increase (Ras61L) in\n\ncells that invaded through the 3D matrix,\n\ncompared to controls (Figures 3E, 3F,\n\nS3D, and S3E). Invasion of NICD cells\nthrough collagen I was also stimulated more than 7-fold by\n\nloss of Par3 (Figures 3G and 3H).\n\nAlthough most metastatic carcinomas retain epithelial charac-\n\nteristics, it has been proposed that tumor cells might undergo\n\na transient EMT during dissemination then revert to an epithelial\n\nphenotype when they colonize an ectopic site (Guarino et al.,\n\n2007). We examined the expression of EMT markers in our\n\ncultures and found a modest increase in ZEB1 expression, but\n\nno overall changes in gene expression that would indicate\n\na complete EMT (Figure S3F).

We conclude\n\nthat in the context of an activated oncogene, loss of Par3 expres-\n\nsion increases invasive behavior, and these cells retain the ability\n\nto express epithelial characteristics.\n\nLoss of Par3 Induces MMP Expression and Cell\nDetachment in Transformed Mammary Cells\nMigration through 3D matrices often requires expression of\n\nmatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade the ECM\n\n(R\u00f8rth, 2009). To test whether loss of Par3, in the context of an\n\noncogene, might alter MMP expression, or expression of other\n\nadhesion-related genes, we performed quantitative RT-PCR\n\narray analysis of adhesion-related genes on primary NICD/shLuc\n\nand NICD/shPar3 MECs in vitro, in the absence of selection. In\n\nthe context of NICD/shPar3, MMP9 showed the most robust\n\nincrease in expression over NICD/shLuc, and MMP9 induction\n\nwas second highest in the Ras model, of all genes analyzed\n\n(Tables S1\u2013S4). Changes in MMP9 expression were confirmed\n\nby RT-PCR using different primers (Figure 4A). The expression\n\nof three other genes was upregulated, and ten genes were\n\nreduced in both models (Figure S4A). Expression of other genes\n\ndiffered between the two models, and the expression of some\n\nother MMPs was reduced (MMP1a, MMP12, and MMP14 for\n\nNICD; and MMP2 and MMP15 for Ras). NICD/shPar3 cells also\n\nshowed significant decreases in the protease inhibitors, TIMP1\n\nand TIMP2. Therefore, in both models, metalloproteinase ex-\n\npression was altered by Par3 depletion, with MMP9 being the\n\nmost consistently upregulated gene.\n\nConsistent with induction of MMPs, there was a dramatic\n\nchange in colony morphology when Par3 expression was sup-\n\npressed. Most NICD/shLuc cells grew as monolayers on fibro-\n\nnectin-coated dishes (\ufffd60%\u201380%; Figures 4B and 4C). In\ncontrast, only \ufffd10%\u201330% of NICD/shPar3 cells formed mono-\nlayers, with the rest detaching as spheroid colonies after several\n\ndays\u2019 culture (Figure 4B). Importantly, all cultures adhered nor-\n\nmally during the first 24\u201348 hr, demonstrating that maintenance\n\nrather than initial adhesive ability of the NICD/shPar3 cells is\n\ndefective. Moreover, after trypsinization, detached cells were\n\nable to readhere to new plates, and again the cells began to\n\ndetach after 24\u201348 hr. To determine if loss of Par3 causes defec-\n\ntive attachment to specific types of ECM, we also plated cells on\n\ncollagen I. Whereas \ufffd67% of NICD/shLuc cells grew as mono-\nlayer colonies on collagen I, less than 1% of cells lacking Par3\n\nremained as monolayer colonies on collagen I (Figure S4B).\n\nRas61L-transduced MECs also grew as monolayers, and\n\nsilencing of Par3 increased multiple layering, whereas detach-\n\nment occurred as single cells, rather than as multicellular spher-\n\noids (Figures 4B, S4C, and S4D). The inability of Ras61L/shPar3\n\nto form spheroids may be due to reduced E-cadherin expression\n\nas noted above, which would prevent cells from maintaining\n\nintercellular adhesions.\n\nConsistent with the idea that ECM degradation is responsible\n\nfor cell detachment, staining for fibronectin showed that whereas\n\nthe ECMwas intact beneath cells that express NICD alone, it was\n(G) Quantification of cell detachment for NICD/shLuc and NICD/shPar3 MECs w\n\n(H) Detachment of Ras61L/shLuc and Ras61L/shPar3 MECs grown with or withou\n\nResults are means of at least three independent cultures.

Finally, we asked if MMP activity\n\nis required for cell detachment. A MMP inhibitor almost com-\n\npletely blocked detachment induced by Par3 depletion in the\n\ncontext of either NICD or Ras (Figures 4E and 4F). To confirm\n\nthe involvement of MMP9 in the invasive behavior of the\n\nNICD/shPar3 cells, we used shRNA-lentivirus that target the\n\nmurine MMP9 and transduced them together with the NICD\n\nand shPar3 viruses into primary MECs. The two most effective\n\nshRNAs (shMMP9-1 and shMMP9-3) significantly reduced in-\n\nvasion through Matrigel (Figures S4E and S4F). The MMP in-\n\nhibitor also efficiently blocked invasion (Figure S4G). Together,\n\nthese data identify a mechanism whereby loss of Par3 induces\n\nMMP9, which triggers degradation of ECM with consequent\n\ncell detachment and increased invasive migration.\n\nCell Detachment Is Mediated through Inappropriate\nActivation of aPKC\nTo confirm that the adhesion defects were caused by loss of\n\nPar3, we first performed rescue experiments using shRNA-resis-\n\ntant human Par3, which efficiently restored the ability of cells\n\n(85%) to remain attached to the ECM (Figure 4C). Notably,\n\nhowever, a mutant (Par3S827A/S829A) that is unable to directly\n\nbind and be phosphorylated by aPKC could not rescue the adhe-\n\nsion defects, with only 28% of colonies growing as monolayers\n\n(Figure 4C). Next, to determine more directly whether aPKC\n\nactivity is required for adhesion, we plated cells with or without\n\nan aPKC inhibitor. This myristoylated pseudosubstrate peptide\n\npenetrates cell membranes and specifically inhibits aPKC iso-\n\nforms. Inhibition of aPKC completely restored cell-ECM adhe-\n\nsion to NICD/shPar3 and reduced Ras61L/shPar3 multilayering\n\n(Figures 4G and 4H).\n\nOur previous work showed that Par3 is required for normal\n\nlocalization of aPKC to the apical surface of luminal epithelial\n\ncells (McCaffrey and Macara, 2009). To determine if aPKC is\n\nalso mislocalized in NICD/shPar3 cells, we stained for aPKC\n\nand ZO1. In the NICD/shLuc control, ZO1 and aPKC both formed\n\na tight border around the cells (Figure S4H). Thus, expression of\n\nthe NICD oncogene alone is not sufficient to disrupt tight junc-\n\ntions and aPKC localization. In contrast, aPKC was completely\n\nlost from the apical junctions of Par3-depleted NICD MECs.\n\nCortical ZO1 persisted in Par3-depleted cells but was more\n\npunctate (Figure S4H). This result is consistent with our previous\n\nstudies showing that loss of Par3 negatively affects tight junction\n\nformation (Chen and Macara, 2005).\n\nBecause inhibiting aPKC can reverse cell detachment, we\n\nasked whether aPKC activity was altered in NICD/shPar3 cells.\n\nActive aPKC is phosphorylated on T403/T410, and immunoblots\n\nof cell lysates for total and p-aPKC revealed a substantial in-\n\ncrease in p-aPKCT410 levels in NICD/shPar3 cells (Figure 5A, left\n\npanels).

Stat3 activation drives MMP expression in multiple\n\ncancer cells and promotes invasive behavior (Song et al.,\n\n2008; Xie et al., 2004). Active Stat3 is also frequently present at\n\nthe invasive edge of tumors (Bromberg andWang, 2009). There-\n\nfore, we stained sections from the NICD tumors for phospho-\n\nStat3 (pStat3Y705). Although few cells were pStat3Y705 positive\n\nin the NICD/shLuc tumors, silencing Par3 increased the number\n\nof pStat3Y705-positive cells throughout the tumor mass (Figures\n\n5B and 5C).\n\nIn many tumors, Stat3 activation can be induced indirectly\n\nthrough cytokine secretion by infiltrating hematopoietic cells\n\n(Yu et al., 2009). To test whether Stat3 activation is intrinsic to\n\nNICD/shPar3 epithelial cells, we examined transduced, unse-\n\nlected MECs. Only \ufffd5% of NICD/shLuc cells expressed detect-\nable (but weak) levels of pStat3Y705. Significantly, however,\n\npStat3Y705 was present in 18% of NICD/shPar3 MECs, with a\n\nhigher intensity of staining compared to NICD/shLuc cells (Fig-\n\nures S5A and S5B). Silencing Par3 in Ras61L MECs also caused\n\na substantial increase in pStat3Y705, as judged by immunofluo-\n\nrescence (Figures S5C and S5D). We confirmed that loss of\n\nPar3 caused a marked increase in pStat3Y705 levels, as deter-\n\nmined by immunoblot (Figure 5D). Furthermore, conditioned\n\nmedium fromNICD/shPar3 cultures failed to induce Stat3 activa-\n\ntion when added to NICD/shLuc cultures (data not shown). We\n\nconclude that Stat3 activation is cell autonomous and does not\n\ndepend on paracrine cytokine signaling from immune cells.\n\nTo determine whether aPKC acts upstream or downstream of\n\nStat3 activation, we inhibited Stat3 and examined aPKC activa-\n\ntion by blotting for p-aPKCT403/410. aPKC activity was indepen-\n\ndent of Stat3 activity (Figure 5A). In contrast, treatment of\n\nmammary NICD/shPar3 cells with the aPKCps inhibitor dimin-\n\nished pStat3Y705 to control levels (Figure 5E), demonstrating\n\nthat aPKC acts upstream of Stat3 induction.\n\nBecause Stat3 can induce MMP expression in some cancer\n\ncells, we next tested the effect of a selective Stat3 inhibitor,\n\nCucurbitacin-I (JSI-124), on mammary cell detachment. Cells\n\nwere treated with 50 nM Cucurbitacin, 24 hr after being plated\n\non ECM, and were examined 48 hr later. Cucurbitacin com-\n\npletely reversed the adhesion defect in NICD/shLuc, NICD/\n\nshPar3, Ras61L/shLuc, and in \ufffd80% of Ras61L/shPar3 colonies\n(Figures 5F and S5E). Moreover, treatment of NICD/shLuc and\n\nNICD/shPar3 MECs with Cucurbitacin significantly reduced the\n\ninvasive potential of the MECs through Matrigel (Figure 5G). In\n\naddition, we asked if reducing Stat3 expression could block\n\nthe effects of Par3 depletion in the invasion of MECs through\n\nMatrigel. As shown in Figures 5H and S5F, knockdown of\n\nStat3 significantly reduced the invasiveness of the oncogene-\n\ntransduced cells that lack Par3. These data suggest that activa-\n\ntion of Stat3 is required for the cell detachment and invasive\n\nphenotypes caused by loss of Par3.\n(J) Quantification of invasion of NICD/shLuc and NICD/shPar3 MECs through Ma\n\n(K) Quantification of lung nodules arising from NICD/shLuc, NICD/shPar3, and\n\nwere examined from each lung of five mice for each treatment.

This mutant phenocopied the\n\nloss of Par3 by reducing cell attachment and increasing invasion\n\n(Figures 5H and S5F). Furthermore, we confirmed that in murine\n\nMECs, active Stat3-C also induces MMP9 (Figure S5G).\n\nJak phosphorylation was also substantially increased by loss\n\nof Par3 (Figure 5D). To test whether Jak is upstream of Stat3\n\nactivation in Par3-depleted cells, we used a specific Jak inhib-\n\nitor, Pyridone 6 (Thompson et al., 2002). This inhibitor blocked\n\nshPar3-dependent Stat3 activation and significantly reduced\n\ninvasion of the cells through Matrigel (Figures 5I and 5J).\n\nImportantly, all of the effects on signaling caused by loss of\n\nPar3 in the context of oncogenic activation could be fully\n\nreversed by expression of a GFP fusion of human Par3 (Fig-\n\nure S5H). GFP-hPar3 did not induce re-expression of the endog-\n\nenous Par3 but inhibited the phosphorylation of aPKC and Stat3\n\nand blocked the induction of MMP9. Therefore, these signaling\n\nresponses depend specifically on the loss of Par3 and are not\n\noff-target effects of the shRNA.\n\nFinally, to determine whether the induction of Stat3-mediated\n\ninvasive behavior is significant for shPar3-dependent metastasis\n\nin vivo, we measured lung colonization after tail vein injections of\n\nNICD-transformed cells with shRNAs against Par3 alone or Par3\n\nand Stat3. As described above (Figure 3), loss of Par3 caused\n\na significant increase in lung metastasis, which was completely\n\nsuppressed by cosilencing Stat3 (Figure 5K). These data identify\n\nan unanticipated pathway in which loss of Par3 results in the\n\naPKC-dependent activation of JAK/STAT signaling, which in-\n\nduces MMP9 expression and consequent destruction of the\n\nECM, increased invasion, and lung metastasis by oncogene-\n\nactivated mammary cells.\n\nPar3 Expression Is Frequently Lost in Human Breast\nCancers\nTo address the relevance of Par3 loss to human breast cancer,\n\nwe explored the expression of the PARD3 transcript in tumors\n\nfrom selected cohorts of patients. Significant reductions in\n\nPARD3 gene expression were apparent in invasive ductal and\n\nlobular carcinomas compared to normal breast tissue (Fig-\n\nure 6A). Notably, PARD3 expression was also reduced in other\n\nepithelial cancers (Figure S6A).We next analyzed a human tumor\n\nlysate array by immunoblot and found a significant reduction in\n\nPAR3 protein for 50% of the tumors as compared to matched\n\nsamples of normal breast tissue from the same patients (Fig-\n\nure 6Ba). A second, independent matched group of 52 patient\n\nsamples also showed significant reduction in PAR3 expression\n\n(Figure 6Bb). The same membranes were also probed for\n\nRanGTPase as a loading control, and the PAR3/RAN ratios\n\nweremeasured, to provide a corrected level of PAR3 (Figure 6C).\n\nTo validate the specificity of the Par3 antibody, we probed breast\n\ncancer cell line lysates under similar buffer conditions to those\n\nused in generating the commercial membranes.

In addition, we immuno-\n\nblotted a limited number of freshly isolated normal and breast\n\ntumor samples including three invasive carcinomas (IDC) and\n\none DCIS, which confirmed a decrease in PAR3 protein expres-\n\nsion in the invasive breast cancer samples compared to normal\n\ntissue (Figure S6C).\n\nTo determine if PARD3 expression is associated with any\n\nchange in survival probability, we compared Kaplan-Meier plots\n\nfor high and low expression of PARD3 using a validated Jetset\n\nprobe (Figure S6D). For a set of 2,324patientswith breast cancer,\n\nlow PARD3 correlated with a modest but statistically significant\n\nreduction in survival probability (p = 9.8 3 10\ufffd5) (Gyo\u0308rffy et al.,\n2010). Our mouse models had revealed that loss of Par3 trig-\n\ngers the induction of MMP9 and invasion. Therefore, we com-\n\npared the expression of PARD3 andMMP9 in cohorts of normal\n\nhuman breast, primary breast cancers, andmetastases. Consis-\n\ntent with a role for loss of PAR3 in regulating metastasis through\n\nMMP9, a significant anticorrelation exists between PARD3 and\n\nMMP9 expression in metastases (Figure 6D). One data set also\n\nshowed a significant anticorrelation in primary tumors, although\n\nto a lesser degree than in metastases (Figure 6Db).\n610 Cancer Cell 22, 601\u2013614, November 13, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc.\nPar3 protein is localized to tight junc-\n\ntions at the apical/lateral boundary in\n\nmurine mammary epithelia (McCaffrey\n\nand Macara, 2009), and immunofluores-\n\ncence of tissue arrays revealed a similar\n\ndistribution for human mammary ducts\n\n(Figure 7A, a\u2013c). Strikingly, however,\n\nPAR3 localization was completely lost\n\nin many of the human breast cancer\nsamples (Figure 7A, d\u2013i). From a total of 76 tumor samples exam-\n\nined, 63 lacked strong cortex-associated PAR3 staining. Impor-\n\ntantly, costaining of tissue sections of 166 human invasive ductal\n\ncarcinomas showed that p-aPKC and pSTAT3 were frequently\n\nprominent in regions with weak Par3 staining, whereas regions\n\nwith more intense Par3 staining were negative for pSTAT3Y705\n\nand p-aPKC (Figures 7B and 7C). Furthermore, many regions\n\nwere dual positive for p-aPKC and pJAK2 (Figure 7D), consistent\n\nwith a role for PAR3 in regulating aPKC, JAK, and STAT3 activity\n\nin human breast cancers.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe apical-basal polarity of epithelial cells is controlled in part\n\nby the Par proteins together with a group of epithelial-specific\n\nproteins first identified in Drosophila (Crumbs, Scribble [Scrib],\n\nLgl, Dlg). Loss of such proteins, or their misregulation, might\n\ntherefore be expected to play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis,\n\nan idea that has been discussed in numerous reviews (Dow\n\nand Humbert, 2007; Feigin and Muthuswamy, 2009; Januschke\n\nand Gonzalez, 2008; St Johnston and Ahringer, 2010). Yet, there\n\nare surprisingly little published data to support this view. In\n\nDrosophila, Scrib, Lgl, and Dlg can behave as tumor suppressors\n\n\n\nFigure 7.

Loss of Par3 in the context\n\nof either oncogene results in the mislocalization\n\nand inappropriate activation of aPKC, which drives\n\nthe induction and activation of Jak/Stat3 signaling,\n\nthereby causing increased MMP expression and\n\nECM degradation.\n\nScale bars, 30 mm.\n\nCancer Cell\n\nPar3 Is a Tumor Invasion Suppressor\n(Bilder et al., 2000; Brumby and Richardson, 2003) and can\n\ncooperate with oncogenes to drive metastasis (Pagliarini and\n\nXu, 2003; Wu et al., 2010). Deletion of Scrib in prostate epithe-\n\nlium predisposed mice to neoplasia (Pearson et al., 2011).\n\nSilencing of Scrib in murine mammary cells stimulated tumor\n\ngrowth driven by c-myc but had no effect on tumor latency\n\nand did not induce metastasis (Zhan et al., 2008). Nor does\n\nsilencing of Scrib disrupt apical-basal polarity in mammalian\n\nepithelial cells (Dow and Humbert, 2007; Qin et al., 2005). Addi-\n\ntionally, increased aPKC activity or Par6 levels have been linked\nCancer Cell 22, 601\u2013614, N\nto TGF-b signaling and to breast cancer\n\ninvasiveness (Viloria-Petit et al., 2009;\n\nZhan et al., 2008). However, to date, and\n\nto our knowledge, the only bona fide\n\ntumor suppressor among the polarity\n\nproteins in humans is PAR4/LKB1 (Jan-\n\nsen et al., 2009), and we are not aware\n\nof evidence that other Par proteins func-\n\ntion as invasion suppressors or that\n\ndisruption of a polarity gene can induce\n\ntumorigenesis through loss of epithelial\n\npolarity.\n\nTo examine this issue, we used lentivi-\n\nruses to deplete Par3 and express acti-\n\nvated Notch or Ras in primary murine\n\nmammary cells, which were implanted or-\nthotopically into normal immunocompetent mice. An advantage\n\nof this approach is that multiple changes in gene expression can\n\nbe manipulated simultaneously, for instance to couple RNAi with\n\nectopic expression. Additionally, the same cells can be used\n\nin vitro, without prior selection, to elucidate the molecular mech-\n\nanisms underlying their phenotypes. This cancer model revealed\n\nseveral unexpected effects of silencing Par3. Most remarkably,\n\ndespite the fact that the Ras and NICD oncogenes function\n\nthrough distinct mechanisms, the phenotypes induced by loss\n\nof Par3 are very similar. Loss of Par3 potently reduced tumor\november 13, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 611\n\n\n\nCancer Cell\n\nPar3 Is a Tumor Invasion Suppressor\nlatency in both contexts and increased lung colonization, consis-\n\ntent with in vitro increases in invasiveness and detachment from\n\nthe ECM. These effects were independent of any consistent\n\npattern of EMT. For example, both the NICD and Ras tumors\n\nand metastases retained K8 and ZO1 expression and did not\n\nexpress the classical mesenchymal markers vimentin or N-cad-\n\nherin, consistent with a classification as luminal-type tumors.\n\nMoreover, loss of Par3 caused the activation of Stat3 and induc-\n\ntion of MMP9 expression in both tumor models. Indeed, the only\n\nconsistent difference was that Ras/shPar3 tumors had lost\n\nexpression of E-cadherin, whereas cadherin expression was re-\n\ntained in the context of NICD.\n\nWhat are the underlying mechanisms through which loss of\n\nPar3 triggers rapid tumor growth and invasion? We propose\n\nthe following model (Figure 7E). First, Par3 spatially restricts\n\naPKC at the apical membrane (McCaffrey and Macara, 2009),\n\nand apical localization requires the binding and phosphorylation\n\nof Par3 by aPKC. Notably, overexpression or mislocalization of\n\naPKC is commonly found in invasive human breast tumors (Ko-\n\njima et al., 2008; Regala et al., 2005). Loss of Par3 triggers both\n\nthe mislocalization and\u2014in the context of at least some onco-\n\ngenes\u2014the activation of aPKC, which, unexpectedly, triggers\n\nJAK-dependent activation of Stat3. Stat3 in turn induces MMP\n\nexpression, resulting in degradation of the ECM and permitting\n\nescape from the primary tumor. Our results generally agree\n\nwith previous data that aPKCswere necessary for STAT3 activity\n\nand MMP1/MMP13 expression in cytokine-stimulated chondro-\n\ncytes (Litherland et al., 2010). However, Litherland et al. (2010)\n\nfound a dependence on ERK phosphorylation, whereas we\n\nsaw no changes in ERK activation in Par3-depleted cells (data\n\nnot shown). Instead, loss of Par3 in an epithelial tumor context\n\ninduces Stat3 activation through JAK by a cytokine-independent\n\nmechanism.\n\nStat3 is normally expressed only at low levels in the devel-\n\noping mammary gland and is upregulated during involution\n\nto regulate cell death. Nonetheless, active STAT3 is often\n\nfound at the invasive edges of tumors (Bromberg and Wang,\n\n2009) and is known to promote metastasis in breast cancer\n\n(Barbieri et al., 2010a). Brugge and colleagues found that\n\nNICD is sufficient to activate STAT3 in MCF10A cells (Mazzone\n\net al., 2010). However, these cells cannot form normal tight\n\njunctions and do not exhibit cortical polarity (Fogg et al.,\n\n2005). Most likely, therefore, aPKC is not restricted to the api-\n\ncal surface, and NICD expression is sufficient to induce Stat3\n\nactivation.\n\nThe coupling between polarity proteins, oncogenes, and Stat3\n\nis paralleled to a remarkable degree by Drosophila, in which\n\nclones of epithelial cells lacking the Scrib polarity protein\n\nbecome highly metastatic in the context of oncogenic Ras\n\n(Pagliarini and Xu, 2003;Wu et al., 2010). Loss of Scrib alone trig-\n\ngers a JNK-dependent apoptotic response through the cell com-\n\npetition pathway, by which neighboring wild-type cells eliminate\n\nthe mutant cells; however, the expression of RasV12 switches\n\nthis response from apoptosis to uncontrolled proliferation, via\n\na compensatory mechanism dependent on JAK/STAT activa-\n\ntion. Tantalizingly, loss of a polarity protein in the mammary\n\ngland also stimulates apoptosis, just as inDrosophila (McCaffrey\n\nand Macara, 2009). An important question for the future is\n\nwhether this response is mediated by cell competition and\n612 Cancer Cell 22, 601\u2013614, November 13, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc\nwhether an aberrant compensatory mechanism drives tumor\n\ngrowth and dissemination when polarity proteins are lost from\n\noncogene-transformed cells.\n\nThe striking effects of Par3 deficiency in the context of\n\nactivated oncogenes suggest that polarity proteins might be\n\nsuppressors of tumorigenesis in human carcinomas. PAR3 pro-\n\ntein levels are significantly reduced in 50% of breast cancer\n\nsamples compared with matched normal tissue, and a large\n\nmajority of breast cancers lack normal PAR3 localization.\n\nImportantly, loss of Par3 was tightly correlated with increased\n\np-aPKC and pSTAT3 across multiple breast tumor samples.\n\nOur data demonstrate that in addition to promoting metastasis\n\nthrough Stat3/MMPs, reduction of Par3 also reduces tumor\n\nlatency, indicating that Par3 may suppress several steps in\n\ntumorigenesis. Microarray data support a broad decrease in\n\nPARD3 gene expression across multiple epithelial cancers,\n\nincluding invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Deletions in\n\nthe PARD3 locus have also been identified. For human esoph-\n\nageal small-cell carcinoma, the PARD3 gene was homozy-\n\ngously deleted in 15%, and expression was reduced in 90%\n\nof cell lines tested, compared to normal esophageal epithelial\n\ncells (Zen et al., 2009). Additionally, small deletions have been\n\nidentified within the PARD3 locus in a variety of cancer types\n\n(Rothenberg et al., 2010). Because Par3 functions in a polarity\n\nsignaling network, mutations in other components of this net-\n\nwork might also contribute to metastasis by human carcinomas.\n\nTogether, our data establish that the Par3 polarity protein is\n\nan important suppressor of tumorigenesis and metastasis and\n\nthat it may play a significant role in human breast cancer\n\nprogression.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\nCulture Conditions, Antibodies, Immunostaining, and Inhibitors\n\nSee Supplemental Experimental Procedures.\n\nOrthotopic Mammary Transplants\n\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved\n\nby the Animal Use Committees at the University of Virginia and McGill\n\nUniversity, Montreal. Freshly isolated mammary cells were transduced with\n\nlentivirus expressing myc-NICD, Ras61L, and control shRNA (shLuc; against\n\nluciferase) or shRNA specific to murine Par3 (shPar3) (Zhang and Macara,\n\n2006). Cells were transduced at an moi of 5 for oncogenes and 10 for shRNA.\n\nFor in vivo tumorigenesis, 1 3 104 transduced MECs for NICD experiments or\n\n1 3 105 MECs for Ras61L were injected into cleared fat pads, as described\n\npreviously (McCaffrey and Macara, 2009). For assessing tumor incidence\n\nand growth, cells expressing NICD/shLuc were injected in the contralateral\n\nside to NICD/shPar3 of each mouse. Mice were examined biweekly for\n\npalpable tumors. To assess metastasis, cells were transplanted into paired\n\ninguinal (#4) fat pads. Once palpable tumors were found, they were measured\n\nwith calipers weekly. Mice were sacrificed when the calculated tumor volume\n\nreached 1 cm\n3.\n\nInvasion Assays\n\nA total of 2.5 3 104 primary MECs/well was transduced with NICD/shLuc, or\n\nNICD/shPar3, Ras61L/shLuc or Ras61L/shPar3 lentivirus, and 2.5 3 104\n\nComma-D1 cells/well transduced with Ras61L/shLuc or Ras61L/shPar3 were\n\nplated in 8 mm pore Transwell inserts (Corning) in a 24-well plate format on\n\ntop of 100 ml of 50% growth factor-reduced Matrigel or 100 ml of Collagen I\n\ngels (rat tail collagen I; GIBCO), prepared as described by Estecha et al.\n\n(2009). Culture medium was changed twice a day for 3 days. After 72 hr, cells\n\nthat had migrated through the Matrigel to the filter were stained with Hoechst\n\n33342 and counted.\n.\n\n\n\nCancer Cell\n\nPar3 Is a Tumor Invasion Suppressor\nTumor Array\n\nCommercially available membranes (ST2-6X-1 and ST2-6X-2) and SomaPlex\n\nBreast Cancer Tissue Lysate Protein Microarray (PMA2-001-L) from Protein\n\nBiotechnologies were probed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (see\n\nSupplemental Experimental Procedures).
