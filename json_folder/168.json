However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of\ncytokine expression by MKP-1, especially at the post-transcriptional level, have not been fully delineated.\nIn the current study, MKP-1 specifically dephosphorylated activated MAPK responses and attenuated\nLPS-induced IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a expression. In addition, MKP-1 was important in destabilizing\ncytokine mRNAs. In LPS-stimulated rat macrophages with overexpressed MKP-1, half-lives of IL-6,\nIL-10 and TNF-a mRNAs were significantly reduced compared to controls. Conversely, half-lives of\nIL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a mRNAs were significantly increased in bone marrow macrophages derived from\nMKP-1 knock out (KO) mice compared with macrophages derived from MKP-1 wild type (WT) mice.\nFurthermore, MKP-1 promoted translocation of RNA-binding protein (RNA-BP) ARE/poly-(U) binding\ndegradation factor 1 (AUF1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to LPS stimulation as evi-\ndenced by Western blot and immunofluorescent staining. Knockdown AUF1 mRNA expression by AUF1\nsiRNA in MKP-1 WT bone marrow macrophages significantly delayed degradation of IL-6, IL-10 and\nTNF- a mRNAs compared with controls. Finally, AUF1 was immunoprecipitated with the RNA complex\nin cellular lysates derived from bone marrow macrophages of MKP-1 KO vs. WT mice, which had\nincreased AUF1-bound target mRNAs, including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a in WT macrophages compared\nwith MKP-1 KO macrophages. Thus, this work provides new mechanistic insight of MKP-1 signaling\nand regulation of cytokine mRNA stability through RNA binding proteins in response to inflammatory\nstimuli.\n\n\ufffd 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nMAPK pathways are essential immune response signaling path-\nways in mammalian cells that respond to external stress stimuli,\ngrowth factors, or infectious microorganisms [1,2]. There are three\nwell-known subfamilies of MAPKs, including ERK, JNK, and p38\nMAPK [3]. Numerous studies have revealed that ERK is mainly acti-\nvated by growth factors and hormones, whereas JNK and p38\nll rights reserved.\n\nSP1, dual specificity protein\nments; RNA-BP, RNA-binding\nctor 1; TTP, tristetraprolin;\n\nection; MK2, MAPK-activated\nrecipitation.\nicrobiology and Immunology,\nve., BSB 449, Charleston, SC\n843 792 5312.\nMAPK are activated by stress stimuli; therefore, JNK and p38 MAPK\nare also referred to as stress-activated kinases (SAPKs) [1]. Activa-\ntion of the MAPK cascade initiates phosphorylation of downstream\nproteins including numerous transcription factors such as AP-1,\nCREB, NF-jB, STAT, nuclear hormone receptors, and nucleosomal\nproteins [1,2]. Thus, activation of MAPKs leads to production of\nvarious pro-inflammatory/or anti-inflammatory cytokines in re-\nsponse to stress stimuli. MAPKs play an essential role in the regu-\nlation of many physiological processes, including cell proliferation,\ndifferentiation, development, immune response, stress responses,\nand apoptosis [4].\n\nAlthough activation of the MAPKs pathways is critical for\nmounting an aggressive immune response to eliminate invading\npathogens and neutralize external insults, an exaggerated MAPK\nresponse can be deleterious to the host. In fact, an exaggerated\nMAPK response is associated with the pathophysiology of various\nhuman diseases, such as septic shock [5], autoimmune diseases\n[6], bone resorption [7], neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer\n[8,9]. Therefore, regulation of both the duration and magnitude\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.06.006\nmailto:klkirk@musc.edu\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.06.006\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n246 H. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255\nof MAPK activation is necessary to maintain immune homeostasis\nand prevent harmful effects associated with an exaggerated MAPK\nresponse.\n\nIn mammalian cells, MAPKs are primarily inactivated by a group\nof dual-specificity protein phosphatases (DUSPs) called MAPK\nphosphatases (MKPs), which dephosphorylate both the tyrosine\nand threonine residues of activated MAPKs [3]. MKP-1/DUSP1 is\nthe first mammalian MKP identified and it is induced by various\nstress stimuli, such as bacterial infection, UV light, hypoxia, heat\nshock, and oxidants [3]. Studies in MKP-1 KO mice revealed that\nMKP-1 KO mice were susceptible to endotoxic shock; the mice\nhad increased production of proinflammamtory cytokines [10,11]\nand increases in the incidence and severity of experimentally in-\nduced autoimmune arthritis [12]. Also, the mice were more sensi-\ntive to hydrogen-peroxide-induced apoptosis [13], and they\nremained susceptible to the development of glucose intolerance\nand hyperinsulinemia caused by high-fat feeding [14] compared\nwith wild type (WT) animals. These results suggest a critical role\nfor MKP-1 in negative regulation of innate immune response to\nbacterial infection and modulation of cellular growth, apoptosis,\nand metabolism. However, the mechanisms underlying how\nMKP-1 restrains immune responses have not been fully defined,\nespecially at the post-transcriptional level.\n\nIt is well-known that many short-lived mRNAs, including mRNA\nencoding cytokines, proto-oncogenes, growth factors, transcrip-\ntional activators, cell cycle regulatory proteins, and various inflam-\nmatory mediators carry adenine and uridine (AU)-rich elements\n(AREs) in the 30-untranslated region (30-UTR) [15\u201319]. Some\nRNA-binding proteins (RNA-BPs) specifically bind with those ARE\nregions of mRNAs. RNA-BPs shuttle between the cytoplasm and\nthe nucleus, contributing to the regulation of RNA splicing, export,\nsurveillance, decay, and translation [20]. Two RNA-BPs that specif-\nically bind to the defined ARE region of mRNAs to mediate their\ndegradation are AUF1 and tristetraprolin (TTP) [21,22].\n\nUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms of MKP-1 regulation\nof cytokine response is critical for understanding innate immunity\nand mechanisms of immune tolerance. Using gain-or loss-of-func-\ntion strategies, we evaluated the role of MKP-1 in regulation of\nMAPK protein and cytokine expression, cytokine mRNA and cyto-\nkine mRNA stability, and its relationship with RNA-BPs. The pres-\nent study provides new evidence that MKP-1 regulates cytokine\nexpression post-transcriptionally by altering nuclear export of\nAUF1.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cells and reagents\n\nRat macrophage NR8383 cells and mouse fibroblast L929 cells\nwere obtained from American Type Cell Collection (ATCC, Manas-\nsas, VA). NR8383 cells were cultured with Ham\u2019s F12K medium\n(ATCC), supplemented with 15% heat inactivated FBS, 100 unit/ml\npenicillin, and 100 lg/ml streptomycin in a 37 \ufffdC incubator with\n5% CO2. The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293A cell line was\npurchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). L929 and 293A cells\nwere cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%\nFBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 lg/ml streptomycin in a\n37 \ufffdC incubator with 5% CO2. L929 supernatant, a source of\nM-CSF, was harvested from L929 cells grown for 7 days after con-\nfluency. LPS from Escherichia coli 0127:B8 (L4516) was purchased\nfrom Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and diluted in PBS. Actinomycin\nD was obtained from CalBiochem (San Diego, CA). Mouse Accell\nSMARTpool AUF1 siRNA (E-042940-00) and control Accell Non-tar-\ngeting Pool siRNA (D-001910-10) were obtained from Dharmacon\n(Lafayette, CO).\n2.2. Animals and primary cells\n\nMKP-1 KO and WT mice were obtained through a Material\nTransfer Agreement from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NY) and bred at\nthe Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Animal genotype\nwas confirmed by animal DNA genotype PCR assays. All animal-re-\nlated work was performed in accordance with NIH guidelines, and\nprotocols were approved by the MUSC Institutional Animal Care\nand Use Committee. Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing\nthe femur and tibia marrow cavities of 6\u20138-week-old mice. Iso-\nlated bone marrow cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS,\n30% L929 supernatant (a supplement of M-CSF), and antibiotics\nfor 7 days to induce the formation of bone marrow macrophages.\n\n2.3. Adenovirus\n\nAdenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)-CMV-MKP-1, which expresses the\nfull-length of MKP-1 gene, and control Ad5-CMV-LacZ were ob-\ntained from Seven Hills Bioreagents (Cincinnati, OH). Adenovirus\nwere propagated in HEK 293A cells, purified by cesium chloride\ndensity gradient ultracentrifugation method, and desalted by\nPD-10 column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) in HEPES buffered\nsaline.\n\n2.4. Western blot assays\n\nTotal proteins were extracted by RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling\nTechnology, Beverly, MA) supplemented with proteinase inhibitor\ncocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN). The nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were ex-\ntracted by NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents\n(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s instruction. Proteins were loaded on 10% or 12% Tris\u2013HCl\nReady Gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and electrotrans-\nferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 5% milk, and then\nincubated overnight at 4 \ufffdC with primary antibodies. Anti-MKP-1\n(M-18) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa\nCruz, CA). Antibodies to p-p38 MAPK; p-SAPK/JNK; p-p44/42\nMAPK (Erk1/2); p38 MAPK, p-NF-jB p65, Lamin A/C, and GAPDH\nwere purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-AUF1 was\nobtained from (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The anti-TTP was ob-\ntained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). The presence of the primary\nantibodies was detected on radiographic film by using HRP-conju-\ngated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) and\nSuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fish-\ner Scientific, Rockford, IL). Digitalized images of the radiographic\nfilms were obtained in a gel documentation system (Bio-Rad\nLaboratories).\n\n2.5. ELISA\n\nIL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, IL-1b, CXCL1, M-CSF, IFN-c and a PGE2\nparameter assay ELISA kits were purchased from R&D systems\n(Minneapolis, MN). Protein concentration in cell lysates was deter-\nmined by DC protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The concen-\ntration of cytokines in cell culture supernatant was normalized by\nprotein concentrations in cell lysates.\n\n2.6. RT-qPCR\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from cells using TRIZOL (Invitrogen)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and quantified by a\nspectrophotometer. Complementary DNA was synthesized by a\nTaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\nCA) using 500 ng of total RNA. Real time PCR was performed using\na StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) condi-\n\n\n\nH. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255 247\ntions used as follows: 50 \ufffdC for 2 min, 95 \ufffdC for 10 min, and 50 cy-\ncles of 95 \ufffdC for 15 s, 60 \ufffdC for 1 min. Amplicon primers of rat IL-6\n(Rn01410330_m1), rat TNF-a (Rn99999017_m1), rat IL-10\n(Rn99999012_m1), rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydroge-\nnase (GAPDH, Rn01775763_g1), mouse IL-6 (Mm00446190_m1),\nmouse TNF-a (Mm00443258_m1), mouse IL-10 (Mm00\n439615_g1), mouse AUF1 (Mm01201314_m1), mouse beta-actin\n(Mm01205647_g1), and mouse GAPDH (Mm99999915_g1) were\nobtained from Applied Biosystems. Amplicon concentration was\ndetermined using threshold cycle values compared with standard\ncurves for each primer. IL-6, TNF-a, IL-10, and AUF1 mRNA levels\nwere normalized to endogenous control beta-actin or GAPDH\nexpression and expressed as fold change compared with control\ngroups. The half-life (t\u00bd) of mRNA was determined as previously de-\nscribed [23].\n\n2.7. Immunofluorescence\n\nBone marrow derived macrophages were fixed with 2% para-\nformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT). After wash-\ning with PBS for three times, the cells were permeabilized with\n0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT. After washing by\nPBS, the cells were blocked by 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at\nRT. After a second washing with PBS, the cells were incubated\nwith anti-AUF1 (1:100, Millipore) with 1% BSA overnight at 4 \ufffdC.\nCells were washed again with PBS, and incubated with an\nAlexa-488 labeled secondary antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) with\n1% BSA for 1 h at RT. After another PBS wash, cells were incubated\nwith Alexa phalloidin 568 (1:10, Invitrogen) for 1 h at RT. Cells\nwere washed again with PBS and mounted on a slide with Pro-\nlong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI reagent (Invitrogen), cov-\nered with coverslip, and incubated at RT overnight. Digital\nimages were recorded using confocal microscopy (Leica, Bannock-\nburn, IL).\n\n2.8. AUF1 RIP-RT-qPCR\n\nRNA-BP immunoprecipitation (RIP) and mRNA isolation was\npreviously described [24]. Briefly, protein A agarose beads (Sigma)\nwere either coated with anti-AUF1 (15 lg) or an equal amount of\ncontrol normal rabbit serum (Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 \ufffdC in\na rotating device overnight. After serial washing, cell lysates\n(2 mg) from bone marrow macrophages were immunoprecipi-\ntated with protein A-coated agarose beads overnight at 4 \ufffdC in a\nrotating device. Ten percent cell lysates were reserved as input\ncontrol. After serial washing, the IP products were digested with\nproteinase K, and RNA was isolated. RNA was extracted using\nphenol and chloroform and precipitated in the presence of glyco-\ngen. For analysis of individual mRNAs, the RNA isolated from the\nIP was subjected to reverse transcription (RT) using random hexa-\nmers and SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplifi-\ncation and quantification of the PCR products were performed\nusing the Applied Biosystems Stepone Plus system (Applied\nBiosystems) and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Bio-\nsystems). Input beta actin mRNA was used as a loading control.\nEach reaction was carried out in triplicate and three independent\nexperiments were performed.\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\n\nData were analyzed with the paired or unpaired two-tailed Stu-\ndent\u2019s t test with Welch\u2019s correction for unequal variances. All sta-\ntistical tests were performed using a GraphPad Prism software\n(GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). P-values of 0.05 or less were\nconsidered significant.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Ad.MKP-1 specifically dephosphorylates activated MAPKs after LPS\nstimulation\n\nTo test the efficacy of exogenous over-expression of MKP-1 by\nAd.MKP-1, rat macrophages (NR8383 cells) were transduced with\nAd.MKP-1 or control vector, Ad.LacZ, at multiplicity of infection\n(MOI) from 100 to 900 for 24\u201372 h. Optimal MKP-1 protein expres-\nsion was achieved at 300 MOI for 48 h (data not shown). The LacZ\ngene expression was confirmed by b-galactosidase staining in cells\n(data not shown). Next, to verify how MKP-1 affects immune signal-\ning pathways, rat macrophages were transduced with either\nAd.MKP-1 or Ad.LacZ (300 MOI), or treated with equal volume of\nHEPES buffered saline. Forty-eight hours after the adenoviral trans-\nduction, the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 lg/ml) for 10, 30, 60,\nand 120 min. Then, MKP-1 protein, p-MAPKs and p-NF-jB p65 were\nmeasured by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1, when nitrocellulose\nmembrane was incubated with a low concentration of anti-MKP-1\n(1:1500), rat macrophages transduced with Ad.MKP-1 displayed\nmodest MKP-1 protein expression without LPS stimulation. How-\never, the MKP-1 protein was significantly induced in those trans-\nduced cells 60 and 120 min after LPS stimulation. In contrast, rat\nmacrophages transduced with Ad.LacZ or treated with HEPES buf-\nfered saline exhibited undetectable MKP-1 protein levels before or\nafter LPS stimulation. When the nitrocellulose membrane was incu-\nbated with a higher concentration of anti-MKP-1 (1:500), there was\nonly weak MKP-1 protein expression 60 and 120 min after LPS stim-\nulation in macrophages transduced with Ad.LacZ or treated with\nHEPES buffered saline (data not shown). Importantly, macrophages\ntransduced with Ad.MKP-1 significantly reduced p-JNK, p-ERK, and\np-p38 after LPS stimulation compared with cells transduced with\nAd.LacZ or treated with HEPES buffered saline. The enhanced\nMKP-1 protein expression 60\u2013120 min after LPS stimulation was\ncorrelated with significant dephosphorylation of those activated\nMAPKs in transduced cells. However, macrophages transduced with\nAd.MKP-1 failed dephosphorylating activated NF-jB p65, which\nsuggested that Ad.MKP-1 specifically dephosphorylated activated\nMAPKs, not activated NF-jB signaling pathway.\n3.2. MKP-1 selectively attenuates IL-6, TNF-a and IL-10 cytokine\nproduction after LPS stimulation\n\nAfter toll-like receptor (TLR) engagement, LPS triggers a cascade\nof signal transduction events that lead to the formation of the\nMyD88/TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) complex, and\nsubsequently triggers activation of NF-jB and MAPKs [25].\nActivation of NF-jB and MAPKs, in turn, leads to phosphorylation\nof transcriptional factors and/or RNA-BPs, which controls the mag-\nnitude and duration of many pro-inflammatory/or anti-inflamma-\ntory cytokine responses. To investigate the effects of MKP-1 on\npro-inflammatory/or anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, rat\nmacrophages were transduced with Ad.MKP-1 or control Ad.LacZ\n(300 MOI) for 48 h. The cells were subsequently stimulated with\nLPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, IL-1b, CXCL1, M-CSF,\nIFN-c, and PGE2 in cell culture supernatant were measured with\nELISA.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2a\u2013c, rat macrophages transduced with\nAd.MKP-1 significantly attenuated IL-6, TNF-a and IL-10 produc-\ntion 24 h after LPS stimulation compared with cells transduced\nwith Ad.LacZ (n = 5, \u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001). Compared with\nmacrophages transduced with Ad.LacZ, macrophages transduced\nwith Ad.MKP-1 had an approximately 2.0-fold decrease in IL-6; a\n2.0-fold decrease in TNF-a, and a 4.0-fold decrease in IL-10 after\nLPS stimulation. However, there was no significant difference in\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Ad.MKP-1 specifically dephosphorylated MAPKs in rat macrophages after LPS stimulation.

MKP-1 inhibits IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10 mRNA levels after LPS\nstimulation\n\nActivated MAPKs phosphorylate numerous downstream target\nproteins, including transcriptional factors and RNA-BPs, which\ncan regulate expression of multiple inflammatory genes at either\nthe transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. To delineate the\nrole of MKP-1 in steady state mRNA modulation, mRNA of IL-6,\nTNF-a, and IL-10 were quantified after LPS stimulation. Rat macro-\nphages transduced by Ad.MKP-1 or control Ad.LacZ (300 MOI) for\n48 h were either unstimulated or stimulated with LPS (100 ng/\nml) for 4, and 8 h separately. As shown in Fig. 3a\u2013c, mRNA of IL-\n6, TNF-a, and IL-10 was significantly reduced in macrophages\ntransduced with Ad.MKP-1 compared with mRNA in cells trans-\nduced with Ad.LacZ (n = 4, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01, \u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001).\n\nTo complement gain-of-function experiments, primary bone\nmarrow macrophage cells from MKP-1 KO or WT mice were either\nuntreated or stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 and 8 h sepa-\nrately.

These results support the idea that MKP-\n1 plays a negative regulatory role in mRNA expression of IL-6,\nTNF-a, and IL-10 after activation of MAPKs by LPS stimulation.\nFig. 3.

MKP-1 enhances the degradation of the mRNAs of IL-6, TNF-a, and\nIL-10 after LPS stimulation\n\nBecause cytokine mRNA stability is affected by the p38 MAPK\nsignaling pathway, including MAPK-activated protein kinase 2\n(MK2) [26], we examined the role of MKP-1 in regulation cytokine\nmRNA stability by performing actinomycin D chase experiments.\nRat macrophages transduced by Ad.MKP-1 or Ad.LacZ (300 MOI)\nfor 48 h were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 h. Actinomycin\nD (10 lg/ml) was added to the cell culture to arrest RNA transcrip-\ntion, and total remaining cytoplasmic RNA was evaluated at vari-\nous time points after addition of actinomycin D. As shown in\nFig. 4a\u2013c, cytokine mRNAs were rapidly degraded in macrophages\ntransduced with Ad.MKP-1, with a t1/2 of 2.9 h for IL-6 mRNA; 1.5 h\nfor TNF-a mRNA; and 2.4 h for IL-10 mRNA. In contrast, the t1/2 of\nmRNAs in macrophages treated with Ad.LacZ significantly in-\ncreased 2.1-fold for IL-6 mRNA (t\u00bd = 6.0 h) (n = 3,\n\n\u2044p < 0.05,\n\u2044\u2044p < 0.01); 1.8-fold for TNF-a mRNA (t\u00bd = 2.7 h) (n = 3,\n\n\u2044\u2044p < 0.01,\n\u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001); and 1.7-fold for IL-10 mRNA (t\u00bd = 4.0 h) (n = 3,\n\u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01).\n\nTo further validate that MKP-1 signaling pathway plays a\ncrucial role in controlling degradation of cytokine mRNA, we\nperformed mRNA decay studies in primary bone marrow macro-\nphages from MKP-1 KO and WT mice.

Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255\nmarrow macrophages from MKP-1 KO mice exhibited slower deg-\nradation of IL-6, TNF-a and IL-10 mRNAs than macrophages from\nWT mice. Cytokine mRNA was rapidly degraded in macrophages\nderived from WT mice, with calculated t1/2 = 3.5 h for IL-6 mRNA,\n0.3 h for TNF-a mRNA, and 0.9 h for IL-10 mRNA. In contrast, the\nt1/2 of mRNA in macrophages derived from MKP-1 KO mice signif-\nicantly increased 1.5-fold for IL-6 mRNA (t\u00bd = 5.4 h) (n = 3,\n\u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01); 2.0-fold for TNF-a mRNA (t\u00bd = 0.6 h) (n = 3,\n\u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01); and 1.6-fold for IL-10 mRNA (t\u00bd = 1.4 h)\n(n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01).

MKP-1 modulates subcellular translocalization of AUF1\n\nRNA-BP AUF1 and TTP can bind AREs in the 30-UTR of many\ninflammatory target gene mRNAs, facilitating mRNA degradation\n[26,27]. To define which RNA-BP contributes to cytokine mRNA\ndestabilization related to MKP-1, we evaluated subcellular locali-\nzation of MKP-1, p-MAPK, AUF1 and TTP in the cytoplasm vs. in nu-\ncleus. Rat macrophages were transduced with Ad.MKP-1 or\nAd.LacZ (300 MOI), or treated with an equal volume of HEPES buf-\nfered saline for 48 h. Cells were then either left unstimulated or\nwere stimulated with LPS (1 lg/ml) for 2 and 4 h. The cytoplasmic\nand nuclear proteins were extracted and analyzed using Western\nblot. As shown in Fig. 5a, MKP-1 protein was mainly induced in\nthe cytoplasm at 2 and 4 h after LPS stimulation in cells transduced\nwith Ad.MKP-1. MKP-1 was undetectable in cells either transduced\nwith Ad.LacZ or treated with HEPES buffered saline both in the\ncytoplasm and in the nucleus. In cells transduced with Ad.MKP-1,\nwith greater MKP-1 induction, there was a significant decrease of\np-p38, p-JNK, and to a lesser extent, p-ERK expression, in the cyto-\nplasm compared with cells transduced with Ad.LacZ or treated\nwith HEPES buffered saline. p-p38 and p-JNK were mainly\nexpressed in the cytoplasm. In contrast, p-ERK was distributed in\nboth the nucleus and the cytoplasm.\n\n\n\nFig. 5. MKP-1 modulates subcellular translocalization of AUF1.

These data are representative\nof three separate experiments.\n\nH. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255 251\nIn macrophages transduced with Ad.MKP-1, there was a signif-\nicant increase in AUF1 (p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1 and p45AUF1) in\nthe cytoplasm and a slight decrease in AUF1 (p37AUF1, p40AUF1,\np42AUF1 and p45AUF1) in the nucleus 4 h after LPS stimulation\n(Fig. 5a\u2013c, n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05), suggesting that AUF1 shuttles from\nthe nucleus to the cytoplasm after LPS stimulation. In contrast, in\n\n\n\n252 H. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255\ncells transduced with Ad.LacZ or treated with HEPES buffered sal-\nine, there was a modest decrease in AUF1 in the cytoplasm and a\nconcomitant increase in nuclear AUF1 post-LPS stimulation. Cyto-\nplasmic TTP expression was induced in all cells stimulated with\nLPS, and no treatment group was significantly different.\n\nTo confirm that AUF-1 subcellular translocation is related to\nMKP-1 status, bone marrow macrophage from MKP-1 KO or WT\nmice were either untreated or stimulated with LPS (1 lg/ml) for\n2 and 4 h. The cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted\nand analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5b\u2013d, AUF1\n(p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1 and p45AUF1) was moderately increased\nin the cytoplasm and decreased in the nucleus in macrophages de-\nrived from WT mice 4 h after LPS stimulation (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05). In\ncontrast, AUF1 (p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1 and p45AUF1) was moder-\nately reduced in the cytoplasm and increased in the nucleus in\nmacrophages derived from MKP-1 KO mice. TTP expression was\nonly induced in the cytoplasm stimulated by LPS, and was not\ndetectable in nuclear fractions of bone marrow macrophages. In\naddition, there was no significant difference in cytoplasmic expres-\nsion of TTP observed in LPS stimulated WT and MKP-1 KO macro-\nphages. Together these results demonstrate that signaling through\nMKP-1 specifically promotes translocation of AUF1 from the nu-\ncleus to the cytoplasm in response to LPS stimulation, but not TTP.\n\nTo confirm that MKP-1 promotes AUF1 cytoplasmic trafficking\nin response to LPS stimulation, we immunofluorescently stained\nbone marrow cells derived from MKP-1 KO vs. WT mice. Cells were\ntreated with LPS for 4 h or left untreated. As shown in Fig. 6, AUF1\nwas primarily present in the nucleus in both MKP-1 KO and WT\ncells prior to LPS stimulation. Post-LPS stimulation, AUF1 remained\nin the nucleus in KO mice macrophages, whereas AUF1 was prefer-\nentially localized to the cytoplasm or localized to both the\nFig. 6.

Five fields (about 100 cells) from each sam\ncytoplasm and the nucleus in WT macrophages. These results sup-\nport the previous observation that MKP-1 signaling promotes AUF1\nnuclear\u2013cytoplasmic translocation after LPS stimulation.\n\nTo conclude that MKP-1-mediated mRNA decay is via AUF1, siR-\nNA, experiments were performed in MKP-1 WT bone marrow cells.\nBone marrow macrophages from MKP-1 WT mice were treated\nwith either Accell SMARTpool AUF1 siRNA or control Accell Non-\ntargeting Pool siRNA (500 nM) for 72 h. Then the cells were stimu-\nlated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 h. RNA decay assay was performed\nafter addition of actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 7a, macrophages\ntreated with AUF1 siRNA significantly reduced AUF1 mRNA expres-\nsion compared with cells treated with control scrambled (Scr) siR-\nNA (n = 3, \u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001). Cytokine mRNAs were degraded slower in\nmacrophages treated with AUF1 siRNA compared with controls\n(Fig. 7b\u2013d). The t1/2 of mRNA in macrophages treated with control\nscrambled siRNA was calculated 1.8 h for IL-6 mRNA, 0.4 h for TNF-\na mRNA, and 0.8 h for IL-10 mRNA. In contrast, the t1/2 of mRNA in\nmacrophages treated with AUF1 siRNA significantly increased 1.6-\nfold for IL-6 mRNA (t\u00bd = 2.9 h) (n = 3,\n\n\u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01); 2.0-fold\nfor TNF-a mRNA (t\u00bd = 0.8 h) (n = 3,\n\n\u2044p < 0.05); and 1.4-fold for IL-10\nmRNA (t\u00bd = 1.1 h) (n = 3,\n\n\u2044p < 0.05). These results confirm that\nAUF1 plays an important role in mediating IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10\nmRNA decay. Together with previous results, we further conclude\nthat MKP-1-mediated mRNA decay is via AUF1.\n\nTo confirm that AUF1 cytoplasmic trafficking correlated with\nthe conjugated amount of cytokine mRNA, a RNA-BP Immunopre-\ncipitation (RIP)-RT-qPCR experiments were performed in which\nprotein A agarose beads coated with anti-AUF1 (Millipore) or nor-\nmal rabbit serum (Cell signaling) were immunoprecipitated with\nprotein lysates from MKP-1 WT vs. KO cells with or without LPS\nstimulation. mRNA was extracted from RIP products, and cytokine\nacrophages were either harvested from MKP-1 KO or WT mice.

As shown in Fig. 8a\u2013c,\nmore AUF1-conjugated IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a mRNA were observed\nin WT cells compared with KO cells post-LPS stimulation (n = 3,\n\u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01). There was a 1.6-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA,\na 2.3-fold increase in TNF-a mRNA, and a 2.0-fold increase in IL-\n10 mRNA in WT cells post-LPS stimulation compared with mRNA\nin KO cells. No target cytokine expression was detected in cells\nwithout LPS stimulation, or in control groups of protein A agarose\nbeads coated with normal rabbit serum. These results demonstrate\nthat AUF1 cytoplasmic trafficking in MKP-1 WT cells is correlated\nwith increases in AUF1-conjugated IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a mRNAs, and\nfurther degradation of those cytokine mRNAs.\n4. Discussion\n\nUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cytokine\nregulation by MKP-1 is critical for comprehension of immune cyto-\nkine restraint and immune homeostasis after inflammatory stim-\nuli. The current study confirms an essential role of MKP-1 in\nmodulating cytokine production in response to inflammatory stim-\nuli and provides new insights regarding how MKP-1 controls sub-\ncellular localization of RNA-BP, and subsequently affects mRNA\nstability. Ectopic expression of MKP-1 specifically dephosphoryl-\nated exaggerated? MAPK activity after LPS stimulation, but not\nthe NF-jB signaling pathway. Over-expression of MKP-1 selec-\ntively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-a, and\nanti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production and increased the\ndegradation of those cytokine mRNAs. This increased degradation\nof specific cytokine mRNAs was associated with the increased\nAUF1 shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and enhanced\nAUF1-conjugated IL-6, TNF-a, IL-10 mRNA.\n\nOf note, exogenous expression of MKP-1 by Ad.MKP-1 did not\ninduce increased MKP-1 protein expression in unstimulated cells.\nIncreased MKP-1 protein expression was only observed 60 and\n120 min after LPS stimulation. Without any stimulus, macrophages\ntransduced with Ad.MKP-1 did not suppress cytokine responses.\nMKP-1 only attenuated the cytokine responses after the LPS stim-\nulus. Interestingly, over-expression of exogenous MKP-1 not only\nattenuated the pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, TNF-a) response,\nbut also decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) after LPS\nstimulation. This demonstrates that MKP-1 gene activation is\ndependent on stress stimuli and activation of MAPKs. MKP-1 acti-\nvation is essential for attenuation exaggerated MAPKs activities\nand maintaining immune homeostasis.\n\nIn this study, over-expression of MKP-1 failed to dephosphory-\nlate activated NF-jB, suggesting that MKP-1 specifically dephos-\nphorylates MAPK, not the NF-jB signaling pathway. With\nexogenous over-expression of MKP-1, IL-1b and CXCL1 were not\nsignificantly different between cells transduced with Ad.MKP-1\nand cells transduced with Ad.LacZ, which indicates that IL-1b and\nCXCL1 might be controlled by other signal pathways, such as the\nNF-jB pathway. Although other investigators [27] have reported\nthat MKP-1 inhibited NF-jB activity, they suggested that MKP-1\ndid not regulate the phosphorylation of IjB, and, instead MKP-1\nmight regulate NF-jB activity at the translational level.\n\nPhosphorylation of MAPKs modulates downstream coregula-\ntory proteins, and nucleosomal proteins, which are implicated in\nthe regulation of cellular localization of various transcriptional fac-\ntors, and affect mRNA export, localization, stability and translation\n[1]. In a cDNA array study [28] using probes for 950 ARE-contain-\ning mRNA, 45 AU-rich mRNA decayed at least 1.5 times\u2014and up to\n6.6 times\u2014faster in the presence of p38 inhibitor. The cDNA array\nstudy agrees with our observations: MKP-1 not only inhibits mRNA\ntranscription of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a), anti-inflam-\nmatory cytokine (IL-10), but also affects the degradation of those\ncytokine mRNAs. Cells transduced with Ad.MKP-1 had significantly\nincreased rates of mRNA degradation compared with cells trans-\nduced with Ad.LacZ. Conversely, macrophages from MKP-1 KO\nmice had delayed cytokine mRNA degradation compared with\nWT macrophages.\n\nIt is well known that MKP-1 is a nuclear protein and it is imme-\ndiately induced in response to activated MAPKs. In the current\nstudy, we show that ectopically expressed MKP-1 is mainly in-\n\n\n\nFig. 8. AUF1 subcellular translocation post LPS stimulation in MKP-1 WT cells was associated with enhanced binding with IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10 mRNAs. Primary bone\nmarrow macrophages were either harvested from MKP-1 KO or WT mice. Cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with 1 lg/ml of LPS (from Escherichia coli 0127:B8) for\n4 h. Protein A agarose beads coated with either anti-AUF1 or control normal rabbit serum were immunoprecipitated (IP) with cell lysates from bone marrow cells with or\nwithout LPS stimulation. RNA was extracted from IP products and RT-qPCR was performed. (a) IL-6 mRNA expression (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05) (b) TNF-a mRNA expression (n = 3,\n\u2044\u2044p < 0.01). (c) IL-10 mRNA expression. (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05). IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10 mRNA were normalized to 10% input RNA endogenous beta-actin expression. The displayed\nresult is representative of three separate experiments.\n\n254 H. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255\nduced in the cytoplasm after LPS stimulation. Also, p-p38 and p-\nJNK are mainly induced in the cytoplasm in stimulated cells. These\nphenomena suggest that Ad.MKP-1 is preferentially retained in the\ncytoplasm or translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in re-\nsponse to LPS stimulation, where MKP-1 dephosphorylates acti-\nvated p-MAPKs. In contrast to p-p38 and p-JNK, p-ERK was\npresent in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Although there\nwas increased MKP-1 protein expression in cells transduced with\nAd.MKP-1 at 2 and 4 h after LPS stimulation, p-ERK was less af-\nfected by MKP-1 compared with p-p38 and p-JNK. The results\nare consistent with findings by Chen et al. [29], supporting the idea\nthat MKP-1 plays a major role in dephosphorylation of activated\nJNK and p38 MAPK, but it only has minor effects on activated\nERK. Because ERK is primarily activated by hormone and growth\nfactors, it may have a minor role in stress stimuli.\n\nAUF1 is well characterized as a factor priming ARE-dependent\nmRNA decay [30\u201333]. Functionally, AUF1 differential splicing of\nAUF1 transcripts yields different mRNA, encoding four different\nisoforms: p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1 and p45AUF1. AUF1-deficient\nmice exhibit symptoms of severe endotoxic shock, including vascu-\nlar hemorrhage, intravascular coagulation, and high mortality after\nLPS stimulation as a result of decreased degradation of mRNA of\nTNF-a and IL-1b [34]. AUF1-deficient mice also develop chronic\ndermatitis with age that is characterized by pruritus and excoria-\ntions, which are associated with increased IL-2, TNF-a, and IL-1b\n[35]. Previous studies indicated that AUF1 could be phosphorylated\nat multiple sites, including serine and threonine [36\u201338]. Early\nstudies suggest AUF1 can also form a complex with other proteins,\nincluding phosphoproteins [32]. Because MKP-1 can dephosphory-\nlate serine/threonine residues, MKP-1 could act directly by dephos-\nphorylation of AUF1 or indirectly through dephosphorylation of\nother novel polypeptides associated with AUF1. Ongoing studies\nare focused on understanding the molecular nature of phosphory-\nlated forms of AUF1 and physical interactions with ARE-containing\ncytokine mRNAs.\n\nCritical to the present studies, other investigators have shown\nthat phosphorylation of AUF1 influences the ARE-binding affinity\ncapacity and the global structure of the AUF1\u2013ARE ribonucleopro-\ntein complexes [37]. Sirenko et al. [39] revealed that ARE-binding\nactivity and transcript stability were inversely regulated by phos-\nphorylation. They reported that both a tyrosine kinase inhibitor\ngenistein and a p38 MAPK inhibitor SK&F 86002 promoted assem-\nbly of AUF1\u2013ARE-dependent mRNA complex, and the degradation\nof those ARE-dependent mRNAs in human monocytes.\n\nIn this study, we show that AUF1 intracellular translocation is\ncorrelated with MKP-1 expression, thus cells with over-expression\nof MKP-1 demonstrated increased cytoplasmic accumulation of\nAUF1 p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1 and p45AUF1 4 h after LPS stimula-\ntion compared with control groups of cells. Correspondingly, mac-\nrophages from MKP-1 WT mice displayed enhanced accumulation\nof AUF1 in the cytoplasm compared with cells from MKP-1 KO\nmice post LPS stimulus. The increased amount of cytoplasmic\n\n\n\nH. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255 255\nAUF1 in WT macrophages was associated with enhanced AUF1-\nassociated ARE-dependent mRNAs, and increased degradation of\nthose targeted cytokine mRNAs.\n\nIn a previous study by Brook et al. [40], dephosphorylation of\np38 MAPK by a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 or a combined\nMEK1/ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 with p38 MAPK inhibitor\nSB202190 caused a translocation of TTP from the cytoplasm to\nthe nucleus after LPS stimulation. However, in this study, TTP\ntranslocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was not observed\nin cells transduced with Ad.MKP-1, or in MKP-1 WT/KO mice stim-\nulated with LPS. This discrepancy may be attributed to the non-\nspecific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, which might affect other\nsignal pathways other than p38 MAPK pathway.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that MKP-1 is activated in\nresponse to stress stimuli, which specifically restrains the exagger-\nated MAPKs responses. MKP-1 specifically attenuates IL-6, TNF-a,\nIL-10 cytokine expressions and plays an essential role in maintain-\ning immune homeostasis. At the post-transcriptional level, MKP-1\nspecifically promotes AUF1 translocation from the nucleus to the\ncytoplasm in response to LPS stimulation, which facilitates the de-\ncay of mRNAs of IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10.\n\nDisclosures\n\nThe authors have no financial conflicts of interest.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis study is supported by grants from National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH): 1R01DE018290 (KL.K), 2P20 RR017696 (KL.K),\nR00DE018165 (V.P) and T32 DE017551 (H.Y).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Yang SH, Sharrocks AD, Whitmarsh AJ.
