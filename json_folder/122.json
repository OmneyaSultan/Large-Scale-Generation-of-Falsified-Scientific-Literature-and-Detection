Four\nproteins encoded in the sigB gene cluster, including\nRsbV, RsbW, RsbY (RsbU) and RsbK, are known to\nbe essential in the sB-mediated stress response. In\nthe context of stress, the hybrid sensor kinase RsbK\nis thought to phosphorylate the response regulator\nRsbY, a PP2C serine phosphatase, leading to the\ndephosphorylation of the phosphorylated RsbV. The\nunphosphorylated RsbV then sequesters the sB\n\nantagonist, RsbW, ultimately liberating sB. The gene\narrangement reveals an open reading frame, bc1007,\nflanked immediately downstream by rsbK within the\n\nsigB gene cluster. However, little is known about the\nfunction of bc1007. In this study, the deletion of\nbc1007 resulted in high constitutive sB expression\nindependent of environmental stimuli, indicating that\nbc1007 plays a role in sB regulation. A bacterial two-\nhybrid analysis demonstrated that BC1007 interacts\ndirectly with RsbK, and autoradiographic studies\nrevealed a specific C14-methyl transfer from the\nradiolabelled S-adenosylmethionine to RsbK when\nRsbK was incubated with purified BC1007. Our data\nsuggest that BC1007 (RsbM) negatively regulates\nsB activity by methylating RsbK. Additionally,\nmutagenic substitution was employed to modify 12\npredicted methylation residues in RsbK. Certain\nRsbK mutants were able to rescue sB activation in a\nrsbK-deleted bacterial strain, but RsbKE439A failed to\nactivate sB, and RsbKE446A only moderately induced\nsB. These results suggest that Glu439 is the pre-\nferred methylation site and that Glu446 is potentially\na minor methylation site. Gene arrays of the rsbK\northologues and the neighbouring rsbM orthologues\nare found in a wide range of bacteria. The regulation\nof sigma factors through metylation of RsbK-like\nsensor kinases appears to be widespread in the\nmicrobial world.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBacillus cereus is a gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic,\nspore-forming bacterium that produces a large number of\nvirulence factors that can either cause food-borne ill-\nnesses with emetic and diarrhoeal symptoms or promote\nopportunistic infections (Agata et al., 1996; Ehling-Schulz\net al., 2004; Schoeni and Wong, 2005). In the context of\nfood processing or host immune pressure, the bacterial\nstress response is a major determinant of bacterial cell\nsurvival and growth (Mihaljevic et al., 2007; Zotta et al.,\n2008). A range of alternative bacterial transcription factors\nwith distinct promoter specificities can confer resistance\nto multiple stressors by controlling the transcription of\ndifferent regulons (Missiakas and Raina, 1998; Gruber\nand Gross, 2003; Kazmierczak et al., 2005). The alterna-\ntive transcription factor sB of B. cereus governs the tran-\nscription of sB-dependent genes and enables the cells to\ncounteract fluctuations in temperature, pH or osmolarity\n(Price, 2002; Hecker et al., 2007).\n\nReceived 8 November, 2011; revised 27 April, 2012; accepted 27\nApril, 2012. *For correspondence.

RsbV\nand RsbW comprise the basic core proteins of sB regula-\ntion, and they participate in protein\u2013protein interactions\nand/or the mechanisms of serine/threonine phosphoryla-\ntion. In unstressed cells, sB is kept inactive by sequestra-\ntion in a protein complex with the anti-sigma factor RsbW,\nwhich prevents sB from associating with the core RNA\npolymerase (Alper et al., 1996; Voelker et al., 1996;\nDelumeau et al., 2002). RsbW is a bi-functional protein\nthat also acts as a kinase and can phosphorylate the\nanti-anti-sigma factor RsbV. Phosphorylated RsbV does\nnot have the capability to sequester RsbW. When under\nconditions of stress, two serine/threonine protein phos-\nphatases, RsbP and RsbU, catalyse the dephosphoryla-\ntion of phosphorylated RsbV, and the unphosphorylated\nRsbV then forms an alternative complex with RsbW,\nthereby allowing sB to bind to RNA polymerase.\n\nIn contrast to the regulatory strategy of partner-\nswitching mechanisms, the two-component signal trans-\nduction system (TCS) is a common regulation module in\nbacteria for environmental adaptation, such as the induc-\ntion of virulence factors, the formation of biofilms, the\ninitiation of sporulation, chemotaxis, quorum sensing, and\nthe utilization of nutrients (Hoch and Silhavy, 1995; Stock\net al., 2000; Galperin, 2006). Typical TCSs are comprised\nof a sensor and a response regulator (RR). Upon receiv-\ning environmental stimuli, the sensor initiates autophos-\nphorylation of a conserved histidine residue in the H-box\nand transfers the phosphate to the downstream RR by\ndirect phosphoryl transfer or through a more complex,\nmulti-step His-Asp-His-Asp transfer via the histidine-\ncontaining phosphotransferase (Hpt) protein (Hoch and\nSilhavy, 1995; Stock et al., 2000; Bijlsma and Groisman,\n2003). In most cases, the phosphorylation of the RR\nreceiver (REC) domain can modulate the function of the\ncoupled output domain (Hoch, 2000; Thomas et al.,\n2008), thus modifying DNA binding or other regulatory\nfunctions. The reversible methylation of specific glutamate\nresidues in the cytoplasmic domains of chemoreceptors\nis known to control bacterial chemotaxis through a TCS\nsignalling route (Wadhams and Armitage, 2004). Two\ncompeting enzymes control the receptor methylation\nstatus: CheR, a methyltransferase, and CheB, a\nmethylesterase/deamidase.\n\nIn B. cereus, RsbY, which is homologous to RsbU and\nRsbP in B. subtilis, is required for sB activation. RsbY\ncontains a PP2C-type protein phosphatase domain in its\nC-terminal region, it presumably hydrolyses phosphory-\nlated RsbV. The N-terminal domain of RsbY is homolo-\ngous to the CheY-like REC domains of TCSs (van Schaik\net al., 2005). Based on domain analysis and genome\ncontext, de Been and co-workers proposed a model in\nwhich RsbK is a hybrid sensor kinase that controls RsbY\n\nphosphatase activity via the phosphorylation of the\nN-terminal REC domain of RsbY (de Been et al., 2010).\nTherefore, sB activity of B. cereus is likely regulated by a\npartner-switching mechanism associated with specific\nTCSs. In the present study, we reveal bc1007 to be\nflanked downstream by rsbK, encoding a CheR-type\nmethyltransferase that is capable of methylating RsbK\nand functions as a negative regulator of sB. The probable\nmethylation sites of RsbK were further assessed by\nresidue substitution.\n\nResults\n\nInvestigation of the role of BC1007 in sB activation\n\nThe sigB gene cluster of B. cereus strain ATCC 14579\nencodes an open reading frame, bc1007, flanking rsbY\nand rsbK, and the consecutive rsbK and bc1007 comprise\nan operon (Fig. 1A). A previous study suggested that\nRsbK and RsbY form a TCS in which RsbK transfers a\nphosphoryl group to RsbY (de Been et al., 2010). BC1007\nis supposed to encode a methyl-accepting chemotaxis\nprotein (MCP) methyltransferase (de Been et al., 2011).\nHowever, the function of BC1007 has not yet been dem-\nonstrated. To determine whether BC1007 is involved in sB\n\nregulation, the bc1007 deletion strain KNU701 was gen-\nerated in this study (Fig. 1B). The deletion of bc1007 did\nnot affect cell morphology or cell growth compared with\nthe wild-type strain (data not shown). To further under-\nstand the function of bc1007, KNU701 was exposed to\n42\u00b0C temperatures and analysed by immunoblot for the\ndetection of the sB, Dps-like bacterioferritin (BC1005), and\nEF-TU (translation elongation factor, a housekeeping\nprotein used as an internal control) proteins. Interestingly,\nin contrast to a wild-type strain, the heat stress did not\ninfluence sB activity due to the high basal level in the\nmutant (Fig. 2A). This pattern of sB expression was vali-\ndated by a similar effect of the Dps-like bacterioferritin\n(BC1005), a member of the sB-dependent regulon\n(Fig. 2A). In the complementary strain KNU703 harbour-\ning pHT304-rsbK-bc1007 (Fig. 1C), sB activity was similar\nto that observed in the wild-type control but not in the\nmock control strain KNU702 (Fig. 2A). This result indi-\ncated that BC1007 directly or indirectly influences sB\n\nactivity. As sB is known to induce the transcription of\ngenes important in the response to stress, we performed\na time-course experiment to examine the effect of\nBC1007 on cell survival when cells were exposed to lethal\ntemperatures. Both wild-type and KNU701 strains were\nsubjected to heat shock with a gradually increased tem-\nperature from 30\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C, the lethal temperature, and\ncell viability was determined by plate count. Consistent\nwith the sB levels detected with the immunoblot (Fig. 2A),\nthe KNU701 strain demonstrated relatively higher survival\n\nMethylation controls the sB activity of Bacillus cereus 2789\n\n\u00a9 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 2788\u20132799\n\n\n\nrates when compared with the wild-type strain, particularly\nfrom 10 to 25 min (Fig. 2B).\n\nAnalysis of the interactions between RsbY, BC1007 and\nRsbK using the bacterial two-hybrid assay\n\nAccording to the gene arrangements, our result indicated\nthat protein\u2013protein interactions may be occurring\nbetween the neighbouring gene products RsbY, BC1007\nand RsbK. Thus, the bacterial two-hybrid system was\nemployed to examine this potential interaction (Fig. 3A).\nFull-length rsbY and rsbK were first inserted into the\nexpression vectors pKT-25 and pUT-18 respectively, and\nthe constructs were then co-transformed into Escherichia\ncoli BTH101. Colony growth on selective plates indicated\na significant interaction between RsbK and RsbY\n\n(Fig. 3B). Using a similar method, a positive phenotype on\nselective media also indicated a significant interaction\nbetween RsbK and BC1007, but BC1007 had no apparent\ninteraction with RsbY (Fig. 3B). Previously, the expression\nof a C-terminal REC domain-truncated rsbK moderately\nincreased sB levels in the rsbK deletion strain (de Been\net al., 2010). Therefore, we attempted to investigate\nwhether the REC-truncated RsbK interacted with RsbY.\nHowever, the combination of RsbY and the REC-\ntruncated RsbK did not exhibit a positive colony pheno-\ntype on MacConkey and LB selection plates (Fig. 3B), but\nblue colonies grown on M63 selection medium were\npresent, indicating that the loss of the REC domain dimin-\n\nFig. 1.

We cloned both the intact rsbK gene\nand rsbK-bc1007 individually into the expression vector\npET21b to overexpress His-tagged RsbK (RsbK-His6) or\nHis6-tagged BC1007 (BC1007-His6) to determine whether\nRsbK is the target protein for BC1007. The protein levels\nof purified BC1007 and overexpressed His-tagged RsbK\nof E. coli cell lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE, in\nwhich RsbK-His6 (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3) and two other\nprotein bands representing BC1007-His6 and its degraded\nderivative BC1007-His6 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 3) were\nvisualized. The presence of each protein was confirmed\nby Western blot using anti-His6 monoclonal antibody, and\nRsbK-His6 was further verified by mass spectrometry\n(data not shown). To conduct RsbK methylation in vitro,\ncell lysates derived from His-tagged RsbK overexpression\nin E. coli (Fig. 4A) were incubated with the purified\n\nBC1007-His6 in the presence of C14-methyl-labelled\nS-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and subjected to autorad-\niography. As a control, C14-methyl SAM was also incu-\nbated individually with the His-tagged RsbK cell lysate\n(Fig. 4B, lane 2) and the purified BC1007-His6 (Fig. 4B,\nlane 1). A radiolabelled signal clearly appeared at the\nmolecular weight corresponding to RsbK when the puri-\nfied BC1007-His6 was mixed with the His-tagged RsbK\ncell lysate (Fig. 4B, lane 3). This signal could not be attrib-\nuted to endogenous E. coli methyltransferases because\nno signal was observed in the control reactions (Fig. 4B,\nlane 2). The result demonstrated that BC1007 is able to\nspecifically transfer the methyl group(s) from SAM to\nRsbK.\n\nIdentification of putative methylation sites by\nsite-directed mutagenesis\n\nAlthough our data demonstrated that RsbK can be methy-\nlated by BC1007 in vitro, it is still unclear which residue(s)\nin RsbK is/are methylated. Recently, a systematic analysis\nsuggested that potential methylation substrates have con-\nserved glutamate and glutamine residues at the \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019\npositions of the \u2018a-b-c-d-e-f-g\u2019 coiled-coil heptad repeat\n\nFig. 3.

The presence of six\nmethylation consensus sequences from Glu431 to Thr472 in\nRsbK has been proposed, indicating 12 putative methyla-\ntion sites at conserved glutamate and glutamine residues\n(Fig. 5A) (de Been et al., 2011). We studied the function of\nthese putative RsbK methylation sites by constructing 24\nRsbK methylation point mutants (rsbKm) (Table S2) where\na methylatable glutamate residue was replaced with either\nan aspartate or an alanine residue. These substitutions\nwere used in other bacteria to mimic unmethylated and\nmethylated glutamates respectively. The aspartate resi-\ndues, which cannot be methylated, maintain the negative\ncharge of a glutamate residue, whereas the naturally\ncharged alanine residues, similar to methyl esterified\nglutamates, cause less perturbation to the predicted\na-helix (Nowlin et al., 1988; Park et al., 1990; Shapiro and\nKoshland, 1994).\n\nThe intact operon rsbKm-bc1007 was then cloned into\nthe low-copy vector pHT304, and the resulting plasmid\npHT304-rsbKm-bc1007 was introduced into the rsbK dele-\ntion strain (KNU802). Subsequently, sB levels were analy-\nsed by Western blot in each strain after 42\u00b0C exposure. sB\n\nactivation was abolished in KNU802 compared with the\nwild-type strain (Fig. 5B). However, sB activation was\nrestored when KNU802 was complemented with the\npHT304-rsbK-bc1007 plasmid. Similarly, restoration of sB\n\nactivity was observed when KNU802 harboured any of the\nplasmids expressing various RsbK methylation mutations,\nexcept for RsbKE439A, and lower expression levels of sB\n\nwere observed when complemented with RsbKE446A\n(Fig. 5B). These data indicated that Glu439 might be a\npreferential methylation site and Glu446 a potential sec-\nondary site for methylation. Our data demonstrated\nthat alanyl substitution on Glu439 or Glu446 significantly\nimpaired sB induction in the KNU802 strain. Therefore, we\nexpected that aspartyl substitution, mimicking demethyla-\ntion of these residues, would result in relatively high levels\nof sB even in the absence of stress. However, only basal\nlevels of sB were detected prior to 42\u00b0C exposure, and the\nsB induction profile under heat stress was comparable to\nthat of the wild-type. These results imply that the lack of\nmethylation at any of these residues is insufficient to\ncause sB activation.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMultiple studies have demonstrated the roles of rsbV,\nrsbW, sigB, rsbY and rsbK in sB regulation in B. cereus\n(van Schaik et al., 2004; van Schaik et al., 2005; de Been\net al., 2010). In addition to these regulatory proteins, the\nsigB gene cluster also encodes a dps-like bacterioferritin\n(bc1005), dispensable for sB activity (Wang et al., 2009),\nas well as bc1007 (Fig. 1A). In the present study, we\nperformed a genetic deletion study of bc1007 using\nrecombinant DNA methods and revealed that bc1007\ndeletion constitutively induced high levels of sB irrespec-\ntive of heat stress, leading to increased viability relative to\nthe wild-type strain upon lethal heat exposure (Figs 1B\nand 2A). These results signify the participation of BC1007\n\nFig. 4. Methylation of RsbK by purified BC1007 in vitro.\nA. The overexpressed His-tagged RsbK of the Escherichia coli cell lysate and purified His-tagged BC1007 were used in the methylation assay.\nProteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining.

Radiolabelled RsbK is indicated by an arrow.\n\n2792 L-C.

However, the high con-\nstitutive sB activity was restored in KNU703 after the intro-\nduction of the complementary plasmid pHT304-rsbK-\nbc1007 (Figs 1C and 2A), and any interference of the\nrsbY or rsbK genes flanking bc1007 should inactivate sB\n\n(van Schaik et al., 2005; de Been et al., 2010). Thus, the\nhigh constitutive expression of sB is simply a conse-\nquence of the bc1007 knockout.\n\nWe were interested in understanding how BC1007\nregulates sB activity. The bc1007 and rsbK genes have\nbeen shown to be transcribed by a sA-dependent pro-\nmoter immediately upstream of rsbK, generating a poly-\ncistronic mRNA (Fig. 1A). The architectural complexity of\nthe functional domains indicate that RsbK acts as a mul-\ntiple hybrid sensor kinase, presumably regulating RsbY\nthrough a TCS signalling pathway in response to external\nand internal changes (de Been et al., 2011). BC1007 has\nbeen proposed to display MCP methyltransferase activity\n(de Been et al., 2011). In the original genome sequence of\n\nB. cereus ATCC 14579 (Ivanova et al., 2003), the product\nof bc1007 was annotated as a chemotaxis protein\nmethyltransferase (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/\n1203356) with 28% and 29% identity with E. coli CheR\n(GI:145523) and B. subtilis CheR (GI:143805) respec-\ntively. BC1007 contains a conserved N-terminal all\nalpha domain from Asn19 to Gly73 and a C-terminal SAM\nbinding domain from Asn85 to Arg263, based on the protein\ndomain information extracted from Pfam (Punta et al.,\n2012, http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/protein/Q81H19). There-\nfore, BC1007 potentially regulates sB through direct inter-\naction with RsbK. This assumption is supported by two\nlines of evidence: (i) the bacterial two-hybrid analysis\nshowed that BC1007 only interacted with RsbK and not\nwith RsbY (Fig. 3) or other regulators in the sigB cluster\n(data not shown), and (ii) autoradiography showed that\nthe C14-methyl group(s) was specifically transferred from\nradiolabelled SAM to RsbK when RsbK was incubated\nwith BC1007 (Fig. 4). Collectively, we conclude that\nBC1007 is the cognate methyltransferase of RsbK and\nfunctions as a negative regulator of sB.\n\nFig. 5. Effects of RsbK mutants on sB activity.\nA. Predicted methylation sites in RsbK. The\nheptad repeat regions of methylation\nconsensus sequences are underlined.\nPredicted methylation sites are indicated by\nbold letters, and the box denotes the second\nresidue of the methylation pair. Numbers\ndepict amino acid positions in RsbK.\nB. The influence of RsbK mutant expression\non sB activation. The plasmid\npTH304-rsbKm-bc1007 was constructed, and\nrsbKm represents the residue substitution on\nthe predicted methylation site in RsbK:\nglutamate/glutamine with alanine mimics\nmethylation, and glutamate/glutamine with\naspartate mimics demethylation. The\nconstructed plasmids were transformed\nseparately into the Bacillus cereus strain\nKNU802, and the resulting strains were\nheated to 42\u00b0C for the indicated time periods.\nCellular extracts were subjected to Western\nblot analysis.\n\nMethylation controls the sB activity of Bacillus cereus 2793\n\n\u00a9 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 2788\u20132799\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1203356\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1203356\nhttp://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/protein/Q81H19\n\n\nWe employed site-directed mutagenesis to determine\nwhich residue(s) out of 12 putative methylation sites was\npotentially methyl-modified under environmental stress.\nAs shown in Fig. 5B, most of the RsbK mutants were\ncapable of inducing sB expression (similar to the wild-\ntype RsbK), but with RsbKE439A, sB levels remained low,\nsuggesting that the Glu439 residue might be the prefer-\nential methylation site critical for sB control in vivo. In\ncontrast, alanyl substitution on Glu446 resulted in only\nminimal sB repression. This attenuated sB activation due\nto RsbKE446A could be explained by two hypotheses.\nFirst, the residue substitution is not exactly the same\nmechanistically as a methylated glutamyl residue,\nalthough alanyl replacement eliminates the negative\ncharge of Glu446. Second, the residue change on Glu446\n\nmay neutralize the negative charge, creating a structural\nconstraint and thereby interfering with proper sB inhibi-\ntion due to the close proximity of the Glu439 methylation\nsite. This explanation is plausible because methylation\nsites have been reported to be spaced evenly at seven-\nresidue intervals on the same face of the a-helix where\nthey are accessible to the methyltransferase (Terwilliger\net al., 1986). Alanyl substitutions on Glu439 and Glu446\n\ninhibited sB to different extents, but the expression of\nRsbKE439D and RsbKE446D, which remain the predicted\nmethylatable Glu446 and Glu439 respectively, rescued sB\n\ninduction, similar to that observed in the wild-type strain\n(Fig. 5B). These results suggest that methylation of any\nof the methylatable sites may be sufficient to repress sB,\nwhereas methylation of one or more residues in RsbK\nmay occur in vivo. This pattern may reflect a subtle\nmethylation pattern in RsbK that fine tunes the level of\nsB induction in response to various stimulation strengths\nor distinct environmental stressors. In accordance with\nthis postulation, a previous study has shown B. cereus\ntreated with 2.5% NaCl to demonstrate a weak level of\nsB activation compared with the bacteria receiving the\n42\u00b0C heat stress treatment (de Been et al., 2010).\nAlthough site-directed mutagenesis was employed at the\nspeculated methylatable positions in this study, substan-\ntial techniques such as mass spectrometry need to be\nused to reflect the in vivo methylation of wild-type RsbK\nunder physiological conditions because mutagenization\nnot only eliminates the putative methylatable residue but\nalso modifies the BC1007 recognition sequence.\n\nMethylation of MCPs in bacterial TCSs is often asso-\nciated with sensory adaptation to diverse environmental\nstimuli (Kirby, 2009). In E. coli, chemotaxis is mediated\nby methylation, producing the increased kinase activity of\nthe MCP-associated CheA (Surette and Stock, 1996;\nGlekas et al., 2011). Modulation of CheA activity through\nthe methylation of MCPs at given sites differentially regu-\nlates chemotaxis in B. subtilis (Glekas et al., 2011) and\ncellular development in Myxococcus xanthus (Scott\n\net al., 2008). Similar protein interactions have been\nmechanistically linked to diverse cellular functions,\nincluding intracellular levels of cyclic di-GMP, growth,\nbiofilm formation and cell development via functionally\nand spatially distinct signalling pathways (D\u2019Argenio\net al., 2002; Kirby and Zusman, 2003; Berleman and\nBauer, 2005; Tran et al., 2008). We demonstrate here for\nthe first time the successful activation of an alternative\ntranscription factor to be governed by BC1007, a CheR-\ntype methylatransferase. Although bc1007 encodes a\nCheR-type methylatransferase, bc1007 is not relevant to\nchemotaxis because deletion of bc1007 did not impair\nthe bacteria\u2019s motility compared with the wild-type strain\n(data not shown). Notably, multiple homologues of asso-\nciated methyltransferases (CheR) and methylesterases\n(CheB) are found in other bacteria (Falke et al., 1997;\nMartin et al., 2001; Kanungpean et al., 2011), but full\ngenome searches revealed no CheB homologues that\ncould be responsible for demethylation in B. cereus. The\nmechanism of the relief of BC1007-mediated inhibition\nremains unknown. Homodimers are known to be func-\ntional units in a few chemoreceptors and histidine\nkinases, and the HAMP domain signalling mechanisms\nare likely intimately tied to this structural organization\n(Parkinson, 2010). It would be interesting to know\nwhether RsbK forms a functional dimer as RsbK contains\na cytoplasmic HAMP domain. If so, is it possible that the\nmethyl group(s) of RsbK constitute(s) steric hindrances\ndestabilizing RsbK dimerization? In addition, in the\nBC1007 deletion mutant, all RsbK methylation sites are\nexpected to be demethylated. As shown in Fig. 2A, this\ndemethylation leads to constitutive sB activation even\nwhen there is no stress. Therefore, one may assume that\nunder non-stress conditions, a certain degree of RsbK\nmethylation keeps sB levels in check.\n\nA previous study using genetic approaches suggested\nthat RsbK activates RsbY via either direct phosphoryl\ntransfer from the HK domain of RsbK to the REC domain\nof RsbY or a multi-step phosphotransfer route in which\nRsbK first transfers phosphoryl from its HK domain to its\nown REC domain, after which phosphoryl is transferred to\nthe RsbY REC domain via a third phosphotransferase\nprotein (de Been et al., 2010). Our bacterial two-hybrid\nresults demonstrated a strong interaction between full-\nlength RsbK and RsbY (Fig. 1B and C), indicating that the\nsB signalling pathway can be mediated by direct phospho-\ntransfer. Additionally, the RR-truncated RsbK retained a\nweak interaction with RsbY, which may explain why the\nexpression of the RR-truncated RsbK elevated sB expres-\nsion in the rsbK deletion strain but never reached the\nmaximum level (de Been et al., 2010). Our results indi-\ncated that the REC domain is required for maintaining\nRsbK in a proper conformation that allows RsbK interac-\ntion with RsbY. Previously, the phosphorylation state\n\n2794 L-C. Chen et al.\n\n\u00a9 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 2788\u20132799\n\n\n\n(D827) of the REC domain in RsbK has been proposed to\nmodulate the efficiency of phosphorelay (de Been et al.,\n2010). Similar regulatory mechanisms have been shown\nin other organisms, such as ArcB in E. coli (Iuchi, 1993)\nand VsrB in Pseudomonas solanacearum (Huang et al.,\n1993). A recent study suggested that the phosphorylation\nof the C-terminal RR domains of VirA functions as an\nactivator to increase phosphotransfer from VirA to VirG in\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens (Wise et al., 2010). The role\nof the phosphorylation of D827 in the REC domain\nrequires further investigation.\n\nGene arrays of the rsbK orthologues and the neigh-\nbouring rsbY and bc1007 orthologues were not restricted\nto members of the B. cereus group but found in a wide\nrange of bacteria, suggesting that the RsbK-M-Y signal-\nling is a common regulatory strategy in bacteria (de Been\net al., 2011). In this study, two heptad segments enclose\nRsbK potential methylation residue Glu439 and Glu446 may\nplay critical roles for sB control. We use sequence logo\n(Crooks et al., 2004; http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/) to\ndescribe the conserved pattern of these two heptads.\nHomologue sequences were constructed from the\nmembers in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes) SSDB (Sequence Similarity DataBase) (Kane-\nhisa et al., 2012) RsbK gene clusters, which are summa-\nrized according to the orthologous relationship by both\nsequence similarity and genome organization among\n1490 Bacterial genomes, 118 Archaeal genomes, and\n171 Eukaryotic genomes (in March 2012). In the highly\nconserved orthologue gene cluster set, 127 RsbK-like\nsequences are found in 10 bacteria phyla (Table S3) to\nhave BC1007 homologues as a close neighbour and\nthese two genes are arranged in the same orientation.\nNo orthologue was found in Archaea and Eukaryotes.\nAlthough some sequences from Cyanobacteria,\nDeinococcus-Thermus and Deltaproteobacteria show\npoor alignment, all of these sequences retain the perfect\nleucine residue repeat (one leucine per seven residues)\n(Fig. S1A). As shown in the sequence logo (Fig. S1B),\nresidue composition of the \u2018c\u2019 position of potential methy-\nlation site (e.g. Glu439) is highly conserved, and the overall\ncomposition of first heptad (Glu439 enclosed heptad) is\nmore conserved than the second heptad containing\nGlu446.\n\nIn summary, our results indicate that the methylation\nof RsbK by a CheR-like methyltransferase BC1007\n(renamed RsbM: Regulator of sigmaB Methyltransferase)\ncould inhibit sB activation in the absence of stress. When\na stress signal occurs, the activated RsbK propagates the\nsignal to downstream regulators (RsbY, RsbV, RsbW) to\nrelease and activate sB (Fig. 6). This finding expands our\nunderstanding of the common RsbK-M-Y module that\ncontrols a diverse array of signalling networks, particularly\nthose containing sB-like stress factors.\n\nExperimental procedures\n\nBacterial strains and plasmids\n\nThe genotypes and sources of the bacterial strains and plas-\nmids used in this study are listed in Table S1. Bacillus cereus\n(ATCC 14579) was grown in brain heart infusion (BHI)\nmedium at 30\u00b0C, and E. coli was cultured in Luria-Bertani\n(LB) medium at 37\u00b0C. The E. coli strains DH5-a, XL-1 blue\nand BL21 (lDE3) were used for plasmid manipulation and\nIPTG-induced expression. The growth of the cultures was\nmonitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm\n(OD600). The antibiotic selection used for cloning and mutant\nscreening was performed with ampicillin (50 mg ml-1), eryth-\nromycin (3 mg ml-1), and spectinomycin (100 mg ml-1), as\nrequired.\n\nFig. 6. Models for sB activation in Bacillus cereus. In the absence\nof stress, sB is maintained inactive in a complex with its anti-sigma\nfactor RsbW, which also inactivates RsbV by phosphorylation\nthrough its kinase activity. RsbM (BC1007) methylates RsbK on\nresidues Glu439 and Glu446 and thereby inhibits sB activity. If\nstimulated by specific stress signals, RsbK is activated, and the\nphosphate directly transferred from the H-box of RsbK to the REC\ndomain of RsbY or indirectly transferred through a multi-step\nphosphotransfer route in which RsbK first transfers phosphoryl from\nits HK domain to its own REC domain, after which phosphoryl is\ntransferred to the REC domain of RsbY via a third\nhistidine-containing phosphotransferase (Hpt) protein (de Been\net al., 2010). This action enhances the phosphatase activity of\nRsbY to hydrolyse RsbV-P. The RsbW : sB complex is disrupted the\ndephosphorylated RsbV because RsbW forms an alternative\ncomplex with RsbV (dashed arrows). Free sB can now interact with\nRNA polymerase and induce direct transcription of the\nSigB-dependent general stress response genes.\n\nMethylation controls the sB activity of Bacillus cereus 2795\n\n\u00a9 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 2788\u20132799\n\nhttp://weblogo.threeplusone.com/\n\n\nBacterial two-hybrid assay\n\nBacterial two-hybrid analysis of protein interactions was per-\nformed as previously described (Karimova et al., 1998). To\nconstruct recombinant plasmids for use in bacterial two-\nhybrid analysis, rsbY, bc1007, rsbK and C-terminal truncated\nrsbK were amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotide\nprimers (Table S2). The amplicons, bc1007, rsbK and\nC-terminal truncated rsbK, were individually cloned in-frame\ninto the multiple cloning site of pUT18. The amplicons, rsbY\nand bc1007, were cloned into pKT25 individually. Comple-\nmentation of protein pairs (Fig. 3) was indicated by blue\ncolony growth on LB plates containing X-gal, by blue colony\ngrowth on M63-defined medium/maltose containing 0.5 mM\nIPTG and 40 mg ml-1 X-gal or by red colony growth on\nMacConkey-maltose agar. Both media contained ampicillin\nand kanamycin to select for the inserted plasmids. The plates\nwere incubated at 30\u00b0C for a maximum of 40 h. The pKT25-\nzip and pUT18-zip plasmids were used as positive controls\nfor protein interaction, and the empty vectors pKT25 and\npUT18 were used as negative controls.\n\nConstruction of bc1007 and rsbK null strains\n\nGene deletion of bc1007 and rsbK was performed as\npreviously described (Arnaud et al., 2004). To produce the\npMAD-Dbc1007 plasmid, two DNA fragments of 800 bp and\n1041 bp, corresponding to the regions located directly\nupstream and downstream of bc1007 respectively, were\namplified by PCR using B. cereus genomic DNA as the tem-\nplate. Using restriction enzymes, these DNA fragments were\ncloned into the pMAD vector on either side of a DNA fragment\n(1221 bp) that was amplified by PCR from pDG1728. Simi-\nlarly, a 739 bp DNA fragment, beginning 424 bp upstream of\nrsbK and continuing through 315 bp of the 5\u2032 coding region,\nand an additional 1411 bp DNA fragment, beginning at\n447 bp of the 3\u2032 end and ending 964 bp downstream of rsbK,\nwere amplified from B. cereus genomic DNA. To generate\npMAD-DrsbK, the coding region of the spectinomycin resis-\ntance gene (750 bp) was inserted in-frame into the above\nDNA fragments. Oligonucleotide primers used are shown in\nTable S2, and the plasmid map is indicated in Fig. 1B. Both\nthe pMAD-Dbc1007 and pMAD-DrsbK plasmids were intro-\nduced into B. cereus by electroporation at 1.7 kV in 1 cm\nelectrocuvettes (Eppendorf). Transformants were obtained\nafter culturing for 2 days at 30\u00b0C on BHI plates containing\nspectinomycin, erythromycin, and X-gal. A pool of individual\ntransformants was used to inoculate a culture of BHI medium\nwithout antibiotics, and this culture was then incubated at\n40\u00b0C until the stationary phase of growth was reached. Two\nadditional growth cycles were performed by diluting the sta-\ntionary phase culture into fresh media, and single colonies\nwere isolated by plating dilutions of the culture overnight onto\nBHI plates containing X-gal and spectinomycin. Several white\ncolonies were also isolated to verify the erythromycin-\nsensitive phenotype. DNA was purified from several clones\nand analysed by PCR using oligonucleotides that hybridized\noutside of the inserts to verify the presence of the deletion\nand the insertion of the spectinomycin resistance gene. Gene\ndeletion was also confirmed by Southern blot. The bc1007\nand rsbK deletion mutant strains were named KNU701 and\nKNU802 respectively.\n\nConstruction of pHT304-rsbK-bc1007 and\npHT304-rsbKm-bc1007\n\nA DNA fragment (2255 bp) containing a partial sequence\nfrom bc1009 and internal to rsbK with the endogenous\nBamHI site was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of\nB. cereus using the Restore-up-SmaI-F and Restore-up-\nBamHI-R primers (Table S2). Another DNA fragment\n(1782 bp), which included the rest of rsbK and full-length\nbc1007, was amplified with the Restore-do-BamHI-F and\nRestore-do-PstI-R primers (Table S2). Both DNA fragments\nwere then inserted into pHT304 to generate pHT304-rsbK-\nbc1007 (Fig. 1C). Complementation of the bc1007 mutation\nfound in strain KNU701 was performed by introduction into\nthe plasmid pHT304-rsbK-bc1007, thus generating strain\nKNU703. The plasmid control (mock) strain KNU702 was\ngenerated by introducing the pHT304 plasmid into the\nKNU701 strain.\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously\ndescribed (Ho et al., 1989; Kanoksilapatham et al., 2007),\nwith slight modifications to generate the vector carrying the\nmutagenic rsbK, pHT304-rsbKm-bc1007. A standard PCR\nreaction (50 ml) was conducted in Phusion\u2122 GC buffer con-\ntaining pHT304-rsbK-bc1007 (30 ng) as the template and 1 U\nPhusion\u2122 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) in 3% DMSO\nusing the primer pairs listed in Table S2. The PCR product\nwas digested with the DpnI restriction enzyme to cleave the\nmethylated pHT304-rsbK-bc1007 template and then trans-\nformed into the E. coli XL-1 blue strain. The mutagenized\nplasmid was extracted, and the mutations were confirmed by\nDNA sequencing.\n\nConstruction of pET21b-rsbK and\npET21b-rsbK-bc1007-6xHis\n\nThe entire rsbK coding region was PCR amplified from the\ngenomic DNA of B. cereus using the primers pET21b-rsbK-\nNdeI-F and pET21b-rsbK-XhoI-R. The PCR product was\ndigested by NdeI and XhoI and cloned into the plasmid\npET21b to generate the plasmid pET21b-rsbK (Table S1). In\naddition, the full-length reading frame of the rsbK-bc1007\noperon with the deletion of the stop codon was cloned into the\nexpression vector pET21b to construct pET21b-rsbK-\nbc1007-6xHis (Table S1). For this purpose, the DNA frag-\nment from the first codon of rsbK to the region containing the\nonly intrinsic BamHI restriction site of rsbK and another DNA\nfragment from the intrinsic BamHI restriction site to the ter-\nminator of bc1007, were amplified with primer pairs with\nrestriction sites introduced (Table S2). Subsequently, the two\nPCR products were digested with NdeI/BamHI and BamHI/\nXhoI respectively, and inserted into pET21b.\n\nWestern blot\n\nBacillus cereus and the engineered derivatives were grown in\nBHI broth at 30\u00b0C with aeration until an OD600 of 0.5 was\nreached. They were then incubated at 42\u00b0C for 10, 20 and\n30 min. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and imme-\ndiately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were subsequently\ndisrupted by sonication. Cell extracts (30 mg) were separated\n\n2796 L-C.

The membranes were probed with 1:5000 dilutions of\nanti-sB, anti-Dps-like bacterioferritin (BC1005), and anti-\nEF-TU (BC0129) polyclonal antisera in PBS-Tween at room\ntemperature for 1 h with gentle agitation. The membranes\nwere then incubated with a secondary antibody (HRP-\nconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG). For the detection of His-\ntagged RsbK expression in E. coli, the membranes were\nblotted with a 1:2000 dilution of an anti-His tag monoclonal\nantibody followed by incubation with a secondary antibody\n(HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG). Enhanced chemilu-\nminescence detection reagents were added to develop the\nimages.\n\nCell viability experiments\n\nWild-type B. cereus and KNU701 strains were cultured until\nan OD600 of 0.5 was reached, and the cells were exposed to\na lethal temperature of 50\u00b0C by shifting the whole cell culture\nflask from a 30\u00b0C to a 50\u00b0C water bath, causing a gradual\nincrease in the temperature. Samples from each bacterial\nculture (100 ml) were taken at the indicated time points (0, 5,\n10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min), streaked onto BHI agar plates at\nthe appropriate dilutions and incubated overnight at 30\u00b0C.\nCell survival was assessed by counting the colony number\nand cell viability for each time point. The results were calcu-\nlated from at least three independent experiments.\n\nProtein overexpression and purification\n\nFor the purification of BC1007, E. coli BL21 (lDE3) cells\nwere transformed with pET21b-rsbK-bc1007. Transformed\ncells were inoculated in 250 ml of LB medium containing\n50 mg ml-1 ampicillin and grown at 37\u00b0C with vigorous\nshaking. At an OD600 of 0.6, protein expression was induced\nfor 3 h by adding IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside)\nto a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Subsequently, the culture\nwas chilled over ice, and the cells were harvested. The\nrecombinant His6-fused BC1007 protein was then purified.\nBriefly, harvested cells were suspended in 30 ml of cell lysis\nbuffer [50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT\nand 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride] and sonicated.\nSoluble proteins were separated from the cell debris by cen-\ntrifugation at 15 000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant\nwas passed through a 0.22 mm filter (Millipore) and loaded\nonto a nickel column (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were\neluted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction.\n\nIn vitro methylation assay\n\nFor the overproduction of RsbK, E. coli BL21 (lDE3) cells\nwere transformed with pET21b-rsbK. As described previ-\nously, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 g for\n10 min at 4\u00b0C after IPTG induction, washed with cold PBS\nand then re-suspended with methylation buffer [50 mM\nHepes (pH 8.0), 0.01% (v/v) NP-40, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT,\n1 mM PMSF]. The collected cells were disrupted by sonica-\ntion to prepare whole cell lysates, and 100 mg of each cell\nlysate was incubated with purified recombinant BC1007\nprotein in 45 ml of methylation buffer supplemented with\n\n500 nCi of S-adenosyl-L-(methyl-14C) methionine (14C-SAM;\n61 mCi mmol-1, GE Healthcare) (radioactive methylation) for\n1 h at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by\nadding 3 \u00a5 10% SDS-PAGE sample buffer [187.5 mM Tris-\nHCl, 6% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) bromophenol\nblue, 1.25 M DTT, pH 6.8] followed by heating at 95\u00b0C for\n10 min. The samples were analysed by 12% SDS-PAGE and\nstained with Coomassie blue. The gel was treated with\nAmplify Fluorographic Reagent (GE Healthcare) for 30 min,\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction, and dried by\nvacuum. The radioactivity was visualized by exposing the gel\nto an X-ray film at -80\u00b0C for 1 week.\n\nAnalysis of conservation of putative methylation sites\nin RsbK-like proteins\n\nTo further describe the conserved pattern of the putative\nRsbK methylation sites, we collect B. cererus RsbK ortho-\nlogue from KEGG SSDB (Kanehisa et al., 2012) for conclud-\ning the consensus signature. In order to avoid the bias of\nconcluding methylation site consensus pattern from an over-\nrepresentative species with multiple RsbK sequences in the\ndataset, one sequence was picked for a single species\nregardless of strain diversity. Totally 79 sequences from Pro-\nteobacteria (48 seqs), Firmicutes (15 seqs), Actinobacteria\n(two seqs), Spirochaetes (two seqs), Bacteroidetes (nine\nseqs), Cyanobacteria (one seq) and Deinococcus-Thermus\n(two seqs), were used in this study (Table S3). Peptide\nsequence segments corresponding to the T421-K495 were\nidentified by multiple sequence alignment (msa) using by\nParallel PRRN in GenomeNet (Gotoh, 1995) and extended to\ninclude 10 more residues in N\u2032 end. The final msa for the\nmethylation sites are performed by ClustalW (Larkin et al.,\n2007) with \u2018slow/accurate algorithm\u2019 and \u2018iterate each\nalignment steps\u2019. The sequence logo of potential methylation\nsites of RsbK family members are constructed from msa\nalignment by WebLogo 3.2 (Crooks et al., 2004, http://\nweblogo.threeplusone.com/) with a colour scheme to show\nthe chemistry property of residues. Both the signature of\nFirmicutes sequences and of all 10 phyla sequences were\nconcluded.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge Michel D\u00e9barbouill\u00e9 (Pasteur\nInstitute, Paris, France) for kindly providing pMAD.
