Kozub\u00edk).\na b s t r a c t\n\nWe demonstrated that TNF-a suppressed differentiation and potentiated cell death induced by buty-\nrate (NaBt) in both adenocarcinoma HT-29 and fetal FHC human colon cells in vitro. Since TNF-a is a\ntypical activator of NF-jB pathway, we studied the role of NF-jB activation in cell differentiation\nand death during the TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment. TNF-a induced rapid NF-jB activation in both\nHT-29 and FHC cell lines and this effect was differently modulated by NaBt in these two cell lines.\nIn HT-29 cells, NaBt potentiated NF-jB activity induced by TNF-a after 4 h treatment. However, this\ninitial potentiation of NF-jB activity was not observed in FHC cells. During additional time of TNF-a\nand NaBt co-treatment, NaBt decreased the TNF-a-mediated NF-jB activity in both cell types. We\nalso detected a different response of HT-29 and FHC cells after the pre-treatment with the NF-jB\ninhibitor parthenolide. Our results indicated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and apoptosis of\ncolon epithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Furthermore, we found significant differences in\nthe mechanism of the NaBt and TNF-a co-treatment effects between cells of non-cancer and cancer\norigin, suggesting that the NF-jB pathway may be more effectively involved in these processes in\ncancer cells.\n\n\ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Above all, the quantity and ratio of lipids and fiber content\nin the diet are among the most important factors. Mutual interac-\ntion of endogenous and dietary substances may influence colorec-\ntal epithelium in various ways. They can encourage a rise of\ninfectious and inflammatory diseases or cancer of the intestine\nand, on the other hand, they may contribute to regeneration of in-\njured tissue or disease therapy [1,2].\n\nShort-chain fatty acid butyrate is formed in the gastrointestinal\ntract of mammals as a result of anaerobic bacterial fermentation of\ndietary fiber [3,4]. It modulates proliferation and induces differen-\ntiation and apoptosis of colon epithelial cells [5,3], both in vivo and\nin vitro, at concentrations of approximately 5 mM [6]. Butyrate can\nalso act as an energy source for the colonocytes. It has paradoxical\neffects on colonic epithelial proliferation\u2014stimulates proliferation\nof normal crypt cells and inhibits growth of colon cancer cells\n[7]. Thus, butyrate contributes significantly to the balance between\nthe cytokinetic processes of epithelial cells in the colon crypts.\nll rights reserved.\nTNF-a, an endogenously produced cytokine of the TNF family,\nbelongs to the intensively investigated biologically active sub-\nstances [8]. It plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory\nprocesses, endotoxic shock, and regulation of cell growth and\ndeath [9,10]. NNF-a is synthesized by macrophages and other\ncells in response to bacterial toxins, inflammatory products and\nother invasive stimuli. It has been suggested that a gut with ac-\ntive injury contains an increased number of NNF-a-secreting\ncells [11]. Endogenous TNF-a at levels higher than those in the\ncorresponding normal colorectal tissues have also been detected\nin extracts of colorectal tumor tissues resected from human pa-\ntients [12,13].\n\nThe proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, are typical\nactivators of the canonical NF-jB signaling cascade, which is acti-\nvated in response to injury, infection, inflammation and other\nstress conditions [14,15]. Butyrate has been shown to reduce\ninflammation in experimental colitis in rats [16], and to decrease\nproinflammatory cytokine expression in intestinal biopsies from\nCrohn\u2019s disease patients via NF-jB inactivation [17]. Therefore,\nit could be used during the therapy of colorectal chronic inflam-\nmations. On the other hand, it has been suggested that NF-jB\nactivation has anti-apoptotic effects in many cell lines [18]. In-\ncreased expression of IjB family proteins has also been found\nin differentiated parts of the colon crypts where the cells undergo\napoptosis [19].\n\nmailto:kozubik@ibp.cz\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n34 M. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343\nTranscription factors of the NF-jB family, including RelA (p65),\nc-Rel, RelB, NFKB1 (p50/p105), and NFKB2 (p52/p100), regulate\nhundreds of genes in the context of multiple important physiolog-\nical and pathological processes [14,20]. In most cells, NF-jB is\npresent as a latent, inactive inhibitor of the jB (IjB)-bound com-\nplex in the cytoplasm. There are two main pathways leading to\nthe activation of NF-jB, namely the canonical and non-canonical\npathways or the classical and alternative pathways, respectively.\nIn both pathways, activation of an IjB kinase (IKK) complex is\nthe common upstream regulatory step. This results in phosphory-\nlation-induced degradation of the IjB, which enables the NF-jB di-\nmers to enter the nucleus and activate specific target gene\nexpression. During the canonical pathway, heterodimers of RelA\n(p65) with p50, p52, or p50 homodimers are liberated by degrada-\ntion of IjBs, particularly IjB-a, while p52/RelB heterodimers are\ntranslocated to the nucleus during the non-canonical pathway\n[21,15,22].\n\nComparing the effects of butyrate and TNF-a co-treatment be-\ntween cancer and non-cancer cells in vitro (using human colon\nadenocarcinoma HT-29 and fetal colon FHC cell lines) we demon-\nstrated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and apoptosis of colon\nepithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Furthermore, we inves-\ntigated involvement of the activation of NF-jB transcription factor\nin the mechanisms of the butyrate and TNF-a co-treatment effects.\nIt has been demonstrated previously that preincubation of cells\nwith butyrate, which induced differentiation, is able to inhibit\nTNF-a-activated NF-jB translocation in colon cancer cell lines\n(HT-29, CaCo-2, SW620) [23,24]. In the present study, we found\nsignificant differences in the mechanism of the NaBt and TNF-a\nco-treatment effects between cells of non-cancer and cancer origin,\nsuggesting that the NF-jB pathway may be more effectively in-\nvolved in these processes in cancer cells.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cell cultures\n\nThe human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells and human fetal\ncolon FHC cells (both ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in\n25 mm2 flasks (TPP; Trasadigen, Switzerland) in McCoy\u2019s 5A med-\nium and in Dulbecco\u2018s modified Eagle medium (DMEM):F12 (1:1)\nmedium, respectively, supplemented with gentamicin (50 lg/ml;\nall Sigma\u2013Aldrich; Prague, Czech Republic) and 10% fetal bovine\nserum (PAN Biotech GmbH; Aidenbach, Germany). The cultures\nwere maintained at 37 \ufffdC in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. The cells\nwere passaged twice a week after exposure to trypsin/EDTA\n(0.05/0.02%) with a plating density of 1:3. For the experiments,\ncells were seeded in 40 \ufffd 10 mm or 100 \ufffd 20 mm Petri dishes, or\nin 12- or 24-well plates (TPP) at a density of 5 \ufffd 104 cells/cm2.\nTwenty-four hours after seeding the cells were treated with NaBt\n(5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; both Sigma\u2013Aldrich), or both, as indi-\ncated in the respective experiments. For the inhibition of NF-jB\nactivation, the cells were pre-treated for 3 h with the inhibitor of\nIKK phosphorylation parthenolide (Biomol International, LP; PA,\nUSA) dissolved in DMSO in a concentration of 10 (HT-29 cells) or\n20 (FHC cells) lM. The cells were harvested 4, 8, 24, 48, or 72 h\nafter the treatments. The culture medium was not replaced during\nthe experiments. Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 25 ng/ml; Invitro-\ngen Corporatiom; Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as a positive control\nfor MAPK pathway activation.\n\n2.2. Cell number counting\n\nCell growth was measured by counting the cells with a Coulter\nCounter (model ZM, Coulter Electronic, Luton, UK). Floating and\nadherent cells were counted separately, and the number of floating\ncells was expressed as a percentage of the whole cell number.\n\n2.3. Cell cycle distribution analysis\n\nThe cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in\nphosphate buffered saline solution (PBS), and fixed in 70% ethanol.\nDNA was stained (37 \ufffdC; 30 min) with Vindelov\u2019s solution (10 mM\nTris buffer, pH 8; 0.7 mg/ml RNAse; 50 lg/ml propidium iodide;\n0.1% Triton X-100). The DNA content was analyzed using flow\ncytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA; argon\nion laser, 488 nm for excitation). Cells (15 \ufffd 103) were acquired\nfor each sample and the percentage of cells in the individual cell\ncycle phases was analyzed using ModFit 3.0 software (Verity Soft-\nware House, Topsham, CA). Single cells were identified and gated\nby pulse-code processing of the area and the width of the signal.\nCell debris was excluded by appropriate rising of the forward scat-\nter threshold.\n\n2.4. MTT assay\n\nThe cells were growing on 96-well plates. Ten microliters of the\n2.5 mg/ml stock solution of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiasol-2yl]-2,5-diphe-\nnyl-tetrasolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) was added to each well.\nAfter 4 h of incubation at 37 \ufffdC in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity, the\nmedium was removed, 50 ll of the extraction buffer (10% Triton\nX-100; 0.1 M HCl) was added and plates were gently shaken for\n2 h at room temperature [17]. The optical densities were measured\nat 570 nm (DigiScan Reader).\n\n2.5. Fluorescence microscopy\n\nThe cells were trypsinized and 0.5\u20132 \ufffd 106 cells (including\nfloating cell population) were incubated with 40 ll of 4,6-\ndiamidino-2-phenyl-indole (DAPI) staining solution (3 lg DAPI/\nml of methanol) in room temperature, in the dark for 30 min,\nand mounted to Mowiol. Apoptotic cells were counted using a\nfluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS IX70; Olympus; Prague,\nCzech Republic). The percentage of cells with the characteristic\napoptotic nuclear morphology (chromatin condensation and\nfragmentation) was determined from a total number of 200\ncells.\n\n2.6. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity determination\n\nThe cells were trypsinized, 5 \ufffd 105 cells were resuspended in\n500 ll of substrate buffer (10% diethanolamine; 5 mM MgCl2; pH\n9.7), and lysed by sonication for 5 \ufffd 10 s using a Branson Sonifier\nB-12 (Branson Ultrasonics Corp.; Danbury, CT) at a power of 30\nwatts. The cell lysates or alkaline phosphatase (ALP; Sigma\u2013Al-\ndrich) in several concentrations (15.6\u20131000 \ufffd 10\ufffd6 U/well) for a\ncalibration curve were incubated with ALP substrate (4-p-nitro-\nphenylphosphate; Fluka) in a 96-well plate (4 parallel wells in each\ngroup) at 37 \ufffdC for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 M\nNaOH (50 ll/well) and the optical densities were measured at\n405 nm by FluostarGalaxy (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offen-\nburg, Germany). The reading values (Units \ufffd 10\ufffd6/5 \ufffd 104 cells)\nwere converted to the percentage of control.\n\n2.7. Nuclear extracts preparation\n\nCells grown on 100 \ufffd 20 mm Petri dishes were washed with\nice-cold PBS, scraped into tubes, and centrifuged for 10 min at\n0 \ufffdC (1000g). The pellets were then incubated in a lysis buffer\n(10 mM Tris base, pH 8.0, 60 mM KCl, 1.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT,\n0.1 mM PMSF, 0.05% NP-40) for 10 min on ice and centrifuged for\n\n\n\nM. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343 35\n4 min at 0 \ufffdC (750g). The resulting \u2018\u2018nuclear pellets\u201d were rinsed\nwith the above lysis buffer without PMSF and NP-40. Nuclear ex-\ntracts were prepared by resuspending nuclear pellets in nuclear\nextraction buffer (20 mM Tris base, 420 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM MgCl2,\n0.25 mM EDTA (chelate II), 25% glycerol), incubating 30 min at\n4 \ufffdC, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 \ufffdC (13,000g). Protein con-\ncentration of the nuclear extracts was determined by the Bradford\nassay, and stored at \ufffd80 \ufffdC until used.\n\n2.8. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)\n\nDouble stranded NF-jB oligonucleotide (AGTTGAGGGGACTTTC\nCCAGGC; VBC-Genomics GmbH; Vienna, Austria) was end-labeled\nwith biotin using the Biotin end-labeling kit (Pierce; Rockford, IL).\nThe binding reactions were performed by mixing 8 lg of the nucle-\nar extract (prepared as described above) with 0.3 lg poly-dIdC and\n3 ll of the binding buffer 5\ufffd (50 mM Tris base, 6 mM EDTA (che-\nlate II), 0.5 mM DTT, 50% (v/v) glycerol) to give a final volume of\n17 ll. After 10 min incubation in room temperature, 3 ll of\n10 lM oligonucleotide was added to each reaction and the reac-\ntions were incubated for an additional 30 min in room tempera-\nture. For the supershift, 1 ll of mouse anti-NF-kB p65 antibody\n(#sc-8008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Santa Cruz, CA) was\nthen added to the reaction, and the mixture was incubated for\n1 h in 4 \ufffdC. To control specificity of the shifts, we also used specific\ncompetition (addition of the excess of unlabeled NF-jB oligonu-\ncleotide), non-specific competition (addition of the excess of unla-\nbeled EBNA DNA), free probe, and the reaction mixture without the\nnuclear extract. The reaction mixtures were separated in a 6.5%\npolyacrylamide/TBE gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane\n(Intergen; Purchase, NY). The visualization by streptavidin\u2013horse-\nradish peroxidase conjugate was performed using the LightShiftTM\n\nChemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce).\n\n2.9. Western blot analysis\n\nThe cells were scraped and lysed in an SDS lysis buffer (100 mM\nTris, pH 6.8; 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); 10% glycerol). The\nextracts of the total proteins were assayed with a DC protein assay\nkit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.; Hercules, CA). Equal amounts\n(20 lg) of whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts with 0.01% brom-\nphenol blue and 1% mercaptoethanol were subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE\nusing 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were transferred to poly-\nvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.; Bedford, MA)\nelectrophoretically in a buffer containing 192 mM glycine, 25 mM\nTris, and 10% methanol. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in\n5% powdered non-fat milk in wash buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in\n20 mM Tris; pH 7.6; 140 mM NaCl). Primary antibodies (rabbit\nanti-NF-jB p65, 1:500, #3034; rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2,\n1:2000, #9101; rabbit anti-ERK1/2, 1:1000, #9102; rabbit anti-\nphospho-p38, 1:2000, #9211; rabbit anti-p38, 1:1000, #9212; all\nCell Signaling Technology, Inc.; Beverly, MA; rabbit anti-I-jBa,\n1:500, #sc-203, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with\nthe blots for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the mem-\nbranes in a wash buffer, secondary antibodies coupled to horserad-\nish peroxidase (anti-mouse IgG, 1:3000; #NA931 and anti-rabbit\nIgG, 1:5000, #NA934, both Amersham Biosciences; Buckingham-\nshire, UK) were added for 1 h. The membranes were washed and\nantibody reactivity was visualized with the enhanced chemilumi-\nnescence (ECL+) reagent (Amersham Biosciences) against X-ray\nfilm-CP (Agfa-Gevaert Group; Mortsel, Belgium). The equal loading\nwas verified by b-actin or a-tubulin expression (mouse anti-b-ac-\ntin, 1:6000, #A5441; mouse anti-a-tubulin, 1:4000, #T6074; both\nSigma) and non-specific amidoblack staining of proteins on the\nmembrane after immunoblotting.\n2.10. Luciferase reporter construct and stable cell transfection\n\nThe reporter construct pBIIX-LUC was kindly donated by Dr. Kalle\nSaksela (Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Tampere, Fin-\nland). The NF-jB-driven plasmid pBIIX-LUC was constructed by\ninserting a synthetic fragment with two copies of the sequence\nACA GAG GGG ACT TTC CGA GAG separated by four nucleotides\n(ATCT) in front of the mouse fos promoter in plasmid pfLUC [25].\n\nThe reporter plasmid was cotransfected with pSV2neo neomycin-\nresistance plasmid into HT-29 cells using electroporation (Bio-Rad\nLaboratories, Inc.; Hercules, CA). Briefly, approximately 1\ufffd 107 cells\nwas mixed with 20 lg of reporter plasmid and 2 lg of pSV2neo plas-\nmid, and electroporated (275 V, 950 lF, 2\ufffd pulse). Subsequently, the\ncells were seeded on a 100\ufffd 20 mm dish (TPP) with a feeder of HT-29\ncells treated with mitomycin-C (5 lg/ml; Sigma\u2013Aldrich). Neomycin\nresistant clones were selected in 300 lg/ml of geneticin (G418 sulfate;\nAlexis; San Diego, CA). The clones containing the reporter plasmid\nwere confirmed by luciferase activity assay.\n\n2.11. Luciferase activity assay\n\nStably transfected cells were seeded in 12-well plates and trea-\nted 24 h later. After 4, 8, or 24 h treatment, the cells were rinsed\nwith PBS and then lysed with 100 ll of reagent (Luciferase Assay\nSystem; Promega Corp.; Madison, WI). Fifty microliters of the ex-\ntracts was mixed with 50 ll of luciferase substrate, and lumines-\ncence was quantified by a luminometer.\n\n2.12. Statistical analysis\n\nAll the data are expressed as the means \u00b1 SD of three indepen-\ndent experiments. Differences between the groups were calculated\nusing one-way ANOVA. With all statistical analyses, an associated\nprobability (P-value) of <5% was considered as significant.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Growth, death, and differentiation of colon epithelial cells during\nTNF-a and NaBt co-treatment\n\n3.1.1. Cell growth\nCompared to control, TNF-a in a concentration of 15 ng/ml did\n\nnot significantly affect cell proliferation of both cell lines used at\nany time of treatment. On the other hand, NaBt (5 mM) inhibited\ncell growth in both HT-29 and FHC cell lines (Fig. 1A), but with dif-\nferent dynamics. The NaBt effect was already apparent after 24 h,\nbeing most significant in FHC cells after 72 h (approximately 70%\ndecrease of cell number versus control). In HT-29 cells, NaBt inhib-\nited cell growth the most significantly after 24 and 48 h of the\ntreatment (approximately 40% decrease of cell number versus con-\ntrol), and the effect diminished after 72 h (only 20% decrease). No\nadditional changes of cell growth were detected after NaBt and\nTNF-a co-treatment in both cell lines.\n\n3.1.2. Cell cycle\nNaBt arrested the cells in the G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle and\n\nsimultaneously decreased the proportion of cells in the S-phase\n(Fig. 1B). This effect corresponded with cell growth inhibition\nshown in Fig. 1A in both HT-29 and FHC cells, and was not signif-\nicantly affected during co-treatment of NaBt with TNF-a. More-\nover, TNF-a alone had no effect on cell cycle distribution.\n\n3.1.3.

Data are presented as means \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 (**P < 0.01) versus untreated controls considered as\n100%; \u00a7P < 0.05 (\u2013P < 0.01) versus NaBt alone; \ufffdP < 0.05 (\ufffdP < 0.01) versus TNF-a alone.\n\n36 M.

NF-jB activation in HT-29 and FHC cells during TNF-a and NaBt\nco-treatment\n\nWe investigated the role of NF-jB in the above-described ef-\nfects comparing fetal FHC and cancer HT-29 cells. To study NF-\njB activation, four different approaches were used. Firstly, we\nestablished HT-29 cell clones with a pBIIX-LUC reporter construct\nfor NF-jB activity detection. TNF-a induced an increase in NF-jB\nactivity in HT-29 cells compared with the untreated control, and\nthis effect was time-dependent (approximately 41- or 27-fold in-\ncrease after 4 h, 47- or 36-fold increase after 8 h, and 75- or 48-fold\nincrease after 24 h treatment in clone 3 or clone 93, respectively;\nFig. 3). Secondly, the time-dependent increase of TNF-a-induced\nNF-jB binding activity in HT-29 and FHC cells was also observed\nby electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA; Fig. 4). Thirdly,\ntranslocation of p65 protein into the nucleus was confirmed in nu-\nclear extracts of HT-29 and FHC cells using Western blotting\n(Fig. 5). Finally, expression of NF-jB inhibitory IjB-a protein was\ndetected in whole HT-29 and FHC cell extracts using Western blot-\nting. TNF-a induced a decrease of IjB-a expression after 4, 8, and\n24 h in both cell lines (Fig. 6).\n\nNaBt alone had no effect on NF-jB activity during a short-time\ninterval, but after 24 h the elevation of the activity compared to\ncontrol was apparent in both HT-29 and FHC cell lines. In HT-29\ncells, this increased activity was detected by clones with the repor-\nter construct (Fig. 3), p65 protein expression in nuclear extracts\n(Fig. 5), and by a decrease of IjB expression (Fig. 6). However, it\ndid not appear in EMSA analysis (Fig. 4). On the other hand, in\nFig. 3. NF-jB binding activity (expressed as relative luciferase activity) of two HT-29 clo\nNaBt (5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or their combination. Data are presented as mean\ncontrols considered as 100%; \u00a7P < 0.05 (\u2013P < 0.01) versus NaBt alone; \ufffdP < 0.05 versus TN\nFHC cells the elevation of NF-jB activity mediated by NaBt 24 h\ntreatment was observed by all methods used except for Western\nblot of p65 in nuclear extracts (Fig. 5).\n\nAfter co-treatment with TNF-a and NaBt, NF-jB activity was\ndifferently modulated in cancer and fetal cells compared to the ef-\nfect of TNF-a alone. While the NF-jB binding activity (Figs. 3 and\n4), its nuclear translocation (Fig. 5), and IjB degradation (Fig. 6)\nwere initially increased after 4 h of the TNF-a and NaBt co-treat-\nment in comparison with TNF-a alone in HT-29 cells, these effects\ndid not appear in FHC cells (Figs. 4\u20136). After 8 h of TNF-a and NaBt\nco-treatment, the activity (Figs. 3 and 4) and nuclear translocation\n(Fig. 5) of NF-jB and IjB degradation (Fig. 6) were similar with\nthat of TNF-a alone treatment in both cell lines. Finally, these\nparameters were decreased after 24 h (TNF-a and NaBt co-treat-\nment compared to treatment with TNF-a alone; Figs. 3\u20136).\n\n3.3. Effects of NF-jB inhibition on HT-29 and FHC cell differentiation\nand apoptosis during TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment\n\nIn order to inhibit NF-jB binding activity, we searched for opti-\nmal dose and time of parthenolide pre-treatment of HT-29 and FHC\ncells. As indicated in Fig. 7, we used both EMSA (Fig. 7A and C) and\nWestern blot of nuclear extracts for p65 expression (Fig. 7B and D)\nto test the effects of 1 or 3 h pre-treatment with parthenolide (20\nor 10 lM) on inhibition of TNF-a-induced NF-jB activation. A sig-\nnificant decrease of NF-jB translocation to the nucleus was de-\ntected after 3 h of parthenolide pre-treatment in both cell lines\nused, but in FHC cells, the decrease was apparent only after higher\nnes (#3 and #93) with pBIIX-LUC construct after 4, 8, or 24 h treatment with either\ns \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 (**P < 0.01) versus untreated\n\nF-a alone.\n\n\n\nFig. 4. NF-jB binding activity (using EMSA) of HT-29 and FHC cells after 4, 8, or 24 h of treatment with either NaBt (5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or their combination;\ncontrols of shift specificity (free NF-jB probe labeled with biotin (lane 1), reaction mixture without nuclear extract (lane 2), specific competition with 100-molar excess of\nunlabeled NF-jB probe (lane 3), TNF-a (15 ng/ml) for 4 h (lane 4), TNF-a (15 ng/ml) for 4 h with anti-p65 antibody added to the reaction mixture (lane 5), and competition\nwith 100-molar excess of unlabeled NF-jB non-specific oligonucleotides). Similar results were obtained in two other independent experiments.\n\nM. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343 39\nconcentration of parthenolide. Thus, we used a 3 h pre-treatment\nwith 10 lM of parthenolide for HT-29 cells and 20 lM for FHC cells\nfor further experiments. To exclude the effects of this NF-jB inhib-\nitor on MAPK pathways, Western blot analysis for phosphorylated\nand total protein expression of ERK1/2 and p38 after 3 h of parthe-\nnolide pre-treatment (10 lM for HT-29 and 20 lM for FHC cells)\nand/or 10 min treatment with EGF (25 ng/ml), which was used as\na positive control for MAPK pathway activation, was performed\n(Fig. 7E). No changes in ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation and no\ninhibition of EGF-mediated MAPK activation was detected after\nparthenolide pre-treatment.\n\nBoth HT-29 and FHC cells presented decreased sensitivity to\nNaBt-mediated inhibition of cell growth after parthenolide pre-\ntreatment (Fig. 8A). However, cell growth was not significantly af-\nfected by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatments in both parthenolide pre-\ntreated and non-pre-treated cells compared to NaBt alone.\n\nParthenolide increased apoptosis induced by NaBt (DAPI stain-\ning) in both HT-29 and FHC cells (Fig. 8B). However, apoptosis in-\nduced by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment was modulated by\nparthenolide differently in HT-29 and FHC cells. While in HT-29\ncells, parthenolide significantly potentiated apoptosis induced by\nthis type of treatment (3.6-fold increase versus NaBt alone), no sig-\nnificant effect of was apparent in FHC cells (1.6-fold increase ver-\nsus NaBt alone).\n\nUnlike FHC cells, the differentiation ability of HT-29 cells in-\nduced by NaBt was strongly decreased after parthenolide pre-\ntreatment (Fig. 8C). In FHC cells, the suppressive effect of TNF-a\non NaBt-mediated cell differentiation (5.8-fold decrease of ALP\nactivity versus NaBt alone) was attenuated after parthenolide\npre-treatment (2.7-fold decrease of ALP activity versus NaBt\nalone).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nColon epithelial cell kinetics may be affected by endogenous\ngrowth regulators or by dietary factors like TNF-a and butyrate,\nrespectively. We demonstrated that TNF-a markedly reduced\nNaBt-induced differentiation in HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells\ncontrary to its potentiation of apoptosis [26]. The ability of TNF-a\nto synergize with NaBt in promoting apoptosis in colon cancer cells\n\n\n\nFig. 5. NF-jB p65 protein expression in whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts of HT-\n29 and FHC cells treated for 4, 8, or 24 h with NaBt (5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF),\nor their combination. Expression of b-actin or PCNA was used as equal loading\ncontrol. Similar results were obtained in two other independent experiments.\n\nFig. 6. IjB-a protein expression of HT-29 and FHC cells treated for 4, 8, or 24 h with\nNaBt (5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or their combination. b-Actin expression was\nused as equal loading control. Similar results were obtained in two other\nindependent experiments.\n\n40 M. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343\nwas shown also by other authors [27\u201329]. However, we newly\ndemonstrate a TNF-a-mediated increase of apoptosis induced by\nNaBt in non-cancer cell line (FHC) derived from normal human fe-\ntal colon. We found a much more dramatic increase of NaBt-in-\nduced differentiation in cancer HT-29 than in fetal FHC cells. This\ndifferent dynamic was already demonstrated by Fajkus et al. [30].\nInterestingly, NaBt-mediated differentiation was significantly sup-\npressed by TNF-a in both cell lines, with the higher effectiveness in\nFHC cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that induction of the\napoptotic process by NaBt is reduced or delayed in fetal cells com-\npared to cancer cells. On the other hand, the potentiation of apop-\ntosis by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment was observed in both cancer\nand fetal cells.\n\nWe suggested NF-jB to be involved in the mechanism of TNF-a-\ninduced modulation of cell differentiation and apoptosis mediated\nby NaBt. The transcription factor NF-jB can play a pivotal role in\nregulating programmed cell death and can possess the ability to\nactivate both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes [31]. TNF-a\nbelongs to the typical activators of the canonical pathway of NF-\njB activation, which is completed by p50/p65 heterodimer binding\nto DNA. To elucidate the role of NF-jB activation during the inves-\ntigated TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment, were compared cancer HT-\n29 and fetal FHC colon cell lines with regard to this parameter.\nWe detected time-dependent TNF-a-induced NF-jB activation in\nHT-29 cells using a reporter constructs sensitive to NF-jB activity\n(pBIIX-LUC). Moreover, we indicated a strong activation of NF-jB\nby TNF-a not only in HT-29, but also in normal FHC cells (results\nof EMSA, p65 expression in nuclear extracts, and decreased level\nof IjB in whole cell extracts). From the report of Zwacka et al. it\ncould be supposed that TNF-a-induced prolonged NF-jB activation\nis associated with TNF-a resistance [32]. Considering that both HT-\n29 and FHC cells are relatively resistant to TNF-a cytotoxicity this\nobservation is in agreement with our results.\n\nIn accord with the results of Rouet-Benzineb et al. we demon-\nstrated no changes in NF-jB binding activity after short-time treat-\nment with NaBt (4 or 8 h) in both cell lines [33]. However, after\n24 h of NaBt treatment, the NF-jB activity was enhanced in both\ncells of adenocarcinoma and fetal origin despite the previously\npublished results that butyrate decreased the activity of this tran-\nscription factor [34]. It has been previously found that butyrate\ncould alter NF-jB subunit composition induced by proinflamma-\ntory cytokines. Inan et al. demonstrated that NaBt pre-treatment\nof HT-29 cells inhibits the TNF-a-mediated p65 and p50 transloca-\ntion to the nucleus [35]. These authors also suggested that NaBt\nprevented the NF-jB subunit translocation by suppressing cellular\nproteasome activity (and subsequently IjB degradation) through\nNaBt ability to inhibit histone deacetylases [24,36]. However, our\nresults showed that NaBt increased TNF-a-mediated NF-jB bind-\ning activity, p65 nuclear translocation and IjB-a degradation in\ncancer HT-29 cells, but not in fetal FHC cells, after 4 h of NaBt\nand TNF-a co-treatment. The difference in NaBt ability to modulate\nTNF-a-mediated NF-jB activation between cancer and fetal colon\nepithelial cells represents the most important finding of the pres-\nent study. The NaBt-mediated increase of TNF-a-induced NF-jB\nactivity in HT-29 cells disappeared during the subsequent 4 h of\ntreatment, and after 24 h NaBt significantly inhibited the TNF-a-\ninduced NF-jB binding activity in both cell lines. The inhibition\nof TNF-a-induced p65 nuclear translocation by NaBt pre-treatment\nwas also indicated in SW480 and SW620 human colon carcinoma\ncells [37,29]. While the NaBt concentration around 5 mM, which\ncorresponds to the physiological concentration in the colon, was\nthe same in the above-mentioned and our experiments, based on\nour previous works [38,39], we used significantly lower doses of\n\n\n\nFig. 7. NF-jB binding activity (using EMSA) (A and C) and NF-jB p65 protein expression in nuclear extracts (B and D) of HT-29 (A and B) and FHC (C and D) cells after 1 or 3 h\npre-treatment with parthenolide (10 or 20 lM; PAR), 4 h treatment with TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or both (TNF + PAR). Phospho and total ERK1/2 and p38 protein expression\n(E) in whole cell extracts of HT-29 and FHC cells after 3 h pre-treatment with parthenolide (10 or 20 lM; PAR), 10 min treatment with EGF (25 ng/ml) or both (PAR + EGF).\nPCNA and a-tubulin expressions were used as equal loading control. Similar results were obtained in another independent experiment.\n\nM.

The difference in the concentrations\nof TNF-a used and also application of this cytokine simultaneously\nwith NaBt (in contrast to NaBt pre-treatment used by the above-\nmentioned authors) may play a role in the dissimilarity of our\nresults.\n\nTo study the involvement of NF-jB in the modulation of NaBt\neffects by TNF-a, we used an NF-jB inhibitor, sesquiterpene lac-\ntone parthenolide. It prevents the NIK- and MEKK1-induced activa-\ntion of IKKs, but does not interfere with the induced activation of\nMAPKs [40]. We found a significant difference in parthenolide sen-\nsitivity between fetal and cancer cells, which may be corresponded\nto the distinct way of NF-jB activation in these two cell lines.\nMoreover, in cancer cell line, pre-treatment with parthenolide\ncaused a significant increase of apoptosis induction by NaBt and\nTNF-a co-treatment, while, in fetal cells, it inhibited apoptosis in-\nduced by this type of treatment. This distinct response could be\nassociated with lower differentiation status in NaBt- or both NaBt\nand TNF-a-treated HT-29 cells after parthenolide pre-treatment\ncompared with FHC cells.\n\nOur results indicated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and\napoptosis of colon epithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Fur-\nthermore, we found significant differences in the mechanism of the\nresponse to NaBt and TNF-a co-treatment between cells of non-\ncancer and adenocarcinoma origin, suggesting that the NF-jB\npathway is more effectively involved in these processes in cancer\ncells. Our findings imply the possible role of TNF-a in the develop-\n\n\n\nFig. 8.
