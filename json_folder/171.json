The\nreceptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, known as G protein-coupled receptors which are essential for migratory\nresponse of ECs toward the shear stress-dependent CXCL8 (interleukin-8), are potential mechano-sensors\nfor mechanotransduction of the hemodynamic forces. In present study, the mRNA and protein expression\nof CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis under three\nconditions of laminar shear stress (5.56, 10.02 and 15.27 dyn/cm2) respectively. Using a scratched-wound\nassay, the effects of CXCR1 and CXCR2 were assessed by the percentage of wound closure while CXCR1\nand CXCR2 were functional blocked by the CXCL8 receptor antibodies. The results showed that the mRNA\nand protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was both upregulated by 5.56 dyn/cm2 laminar shear stress,\nbut was both downregulated by 15.27 dyn/cm2. The wound closure was inhibited significantly while cells\nwere treated with those antibodies in all the conditions. It was suggested that CXCR1 and CXCR2 are\ninvolved in mediating the laminar shear stress-induced EC migration. Taken together, these findings indi-\ncated that CXCR1 and CXCR2 are novel mechano-sensors mediating laminar shear stress-induced EC\nmigration. Understanding this expanded mechanism of laminar shear stress-induced cell migration will\nprovide novel molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\ufffd 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nIn vascular blood vessels, shear stress is borne primarily by endo-\nthelial cells (ECs) [1]. Shear stress has been shown to modulate endo-\nthelial cell (EC) migration by Ando et al. [2]. The migration of ECs\nplays critical roles in vascular physiology and pathology. For exam-\nple, EC migration is a prominent component of re-endothelization,\nvascular remodeling and angiogenesis. In post-operative (i.e., bal-\nloon angioplasty or bypass surgery) wound progress, the migration\nof nearby ECs into the injured area is crucial for wound closure and\nit could prevent the development of restenosis eventually.\n\nPersistent cell migration is a complex process that is physically\ncoordinated both spatially and temporally, including the dynamic\nprocesses of cytoskeleton, the regulation of signal transduction,\nand the adhesion and detachment to neighboring cells or extracel-\nlular matrix (ECM) [3\u20135]. There are many studies focused on both\nthe molecular basis underlying modulation of EC migration by the\nll rights reserved.\n\nscular Diseases, West China\nuan, Chengdu 610041, China.\nfluid dynamic forces, and the spatially and temporally cellular sig-\nnaling transduction [1,6]. However, how the mechanical forces are\ntransduced into ECs is unclear until now. So far as is known, there\nare mechanical effects induced by fluid shear stress, contributing\nto cell deformation, spreading, movement, and shape changes\n[7,8]. The mechanical force can be highly sensitive by \u2018\u2018biochemical\nreceptors\u2019\u2019 that act as mechano-sensors transducing shear stress\ninto cell biological responses [1,6].\n\nCXCR1 and CXCR2 are G protein-coupled receptors. The migra-\ntion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) toward\nCXCL8 is related to both CXCR1 and CXCR2 in vitro static conditions\n[9]. CXCL8 is one of the important chemokines that regulates cell\ncytoskeleton reassembly and migration [10]. Our previous studies\nshowed that CXCL8 and shear stress were interacted in modulation\nthe functional activities of HUVECs [11], and the mRNA expression\nof CXCL8 induced by shear stress was force intensity-dependent\nand time-dependent [12,13]. When HUVECs exposed to low fluid\nshear stress (2.23 dyn/cm2) for 1 or 2 h, the expression of CXCL8\nmRNA increased about 68 or 52 times as that of HUVECs exposed\nto high fluid shear stress (19.29 dyn/cm2). In additional to\nendothelial cells, CXCR1 and CXCR2 are expressed on melanoma\n[14], neutralization of CXCR1 and CXCR2 using small molecule\nantagonists affects cell proliferation and migration [14], and\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2010.09.007\nmailto:liuxiaohg@sina.com.cn\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2010.09.007\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\nY. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351 43\ndownregulation of CXCR1 or CXCR2 by employed a gene knock-\ndown strategy decreasing melanoma cell migration [15]. Therefore,\nthese results suggested that CXCR1 and CXCR2 are potential mec-\nhano-sensors mediating the shear stress-induced EC migration.\n\nSpecially, different culture conditions in vitro have various influ-\nences on the expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in ECs, although the\nexpression level of CXCR1 and CXCR2 is very low in vitro static con-\nditions [9,16\u201318].\n\nOur investigations in this study focused on the mechanical\u2013bio-\nlogical mechanism of the migratory response of ECs during exposed\nto laminar shear flow. Firstly, the mRNA expression of CXCR1 and\nCXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells under three conditions of laminar shear\nstress (5.56, 10.02 and 15.27 dyn/cm2) was detected by RT-PCR anal-\nysis, and the protein expression of them was also detected by Wes-\ntern blot analysis. Secondly, a scratched-wound assay was used\nwhile the receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 were functional blocked by\nanti-CXCR1 alone, anti-CXCR2 alone and anti-CXCR1 in combination\nwith anti-CXCR2. Finally, the effects of CXCR1 and CXCR2 were as-\nsessed by the index of the percentage of the wound closure. Our re-\nsults showed that the mRNA and protein expression of CXCR1 and\nCXCR2 was both upregulated by 5.56 dyn/cm2 laminar shear stress,\nbut was both downregulated by 15.27 dyn/cm2. The wound closure\nwas inhibited significantly when CXCR1 and/or CXCR2 were blocked\nby those CXCL8 antibodies. Our results confirmed that the receptors\nCXCR1 and CXCR2 are involved in mediating the laminar shear\nstress-induced EC migration. Overall, these findings suggested that\nCXCR1 and CXCR2 played mechano-sensitive roles in modulation\nof laminar shear stress-induced EC migration.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cell culture\n\nThe EA.hy926 cells (Hematology Research Institute of Jiangsu\nProvince, China) are a hybridoma between HUVECs and the epithe-\nlioma A549 and retain most of the features of HUVECs, including\nthe expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and human fac-\ntor VIII\u2013related Ag [19]. EA.hy926 cells were cultured at 37 \ufffdC with\n5% CO2 in RPMI1640 medium (pH 7.2\u20137.4, Gibco, USA) supple-\nmented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hangzhou Sijiqing Bio-\nlogical Engineering Materials Co., Ltd., China), 20 mmol/L HEPES\n(Sigma, USA), 2\u2030 NaHCO3 and 2% HAT (Sigma, USA). Cells of pas-\nsage 3 or 4 were then seeded onto glass slides that were pre-coated\nwith 50 lg\ufffdml\ufffd1 Fibronectin (Roche, Germany) for 45 min at 37 \ufffdC.\nIn most experiments, the cells were used 1\u20132 days after attaining\nconfluence, although a few experiments were performed 3\u20135 days\npostconfluence. The postconfluence time had no influence on the\nresults.\n2.2. Shear stress experiments\n\nEA.hy926 cells were exposed to steady laminar shear stress using\na parallel flow chamber as previously described elsewhere [20,21].\nBriefly, the flow chamber was connected to a recirculation flow loop\nvia Masterflex PharMed tube (Cole-Parmer Instrument, Vernon Hills,\nIL). Flow in the loop was provided by a peristaltic pump (Cole-Parm-\ner, USA) drawing fluid (serum-free RPMI1640 medium) from a main\nreservoir, which subsequently passed into two buffer reservoirs to\ndampened pulsatility before entering the flow chamber. Flow exit-\ning from the chamber was recirculated back into the main reservoir.\nMedium was equilibrated with 5% CO2 /95% air, and the temperature\nwas maintained at 37 \ufffdC by placing the main and buffer reservoirs in\na temperature-controlled water bath. Laminar shear stress was con-\ntrolled by changing the medium flow rate. Three levels of shear\nstress were applied in this study: a relatively \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 shear stress of\n5.56 dyn/cm2 that typifies shear stress levels within disturbed flow\nregions, a relatively \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 shear stress of 15.27 dyn/cm2 that is typ-\nical for undisturbed flow zones within large arteries, and a relatively\n\u2018\u2018mid\u2019\u2019 shear stress of 10.02 dyn/cm2 reflecting within the physiolog-\nical range in human major arteries. Static controls were also concur-\nrently performed.\n\n2.3. RT-PCR detection\n\nThe mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in shear stress stim-\nulated EA.hy926 cells was semi-quantitatively detected by reverse\ntranscription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after various\nexposure time. Total RNA was isolated from the cells using the TRI-\nzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA), and then RT-PCR was carried out by\nusing the TaKaRa One Step RNA PCR Kit (AMV) (TaKaRa, Dalian,\nChina) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. To obtain\nthe relative quantitative values for gene expression, glyceralde-\nhyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endog-\nenous control. Sequences of the primers used for RT-PCR were\ndesigned by Dalian Biotechnology (China) as follows:\n\nGene name: CXCR1.\nSense primer: 50CCAGTCCAGTTTGCTATGAGGT30.\nAnti-sense primer: 50TGTAGGAGGTAACACGATGACG30.\nGene name: CXCR2.\n\nSense primer: 50TACTCTTTGCCCTGACCTTGC30.\nAnti-sense primer: 50GGGTGAATCCGTAGCAGAACA30.\n\nGene name: GAPDH.\n\nSense primer: 50AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTG30.\nAnti-sense primer: 50AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC30.\n\nThe PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1%\nagarose gel in 1 \ufffd Tris\u2013acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer after staining\nwith 0.5 lg\ufffdml\ufffd1 ethidium bromide. Images were analyzed by Im-\nage Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA).\n\n2.4. Western blot analysis\n\nEA.hy926 cells were treated with different shear stress magni-\ntudes at various exposure time, and then proteins were extracted\naccording to protein extraction kit (PMSF methods, Beyotime Bio-\ntech, China). Protein concentration was measured using a bicinch-\noninic acid protein assay (BCA method, BioDev-Tech. Co., Ltd.,\nChina). Protein samples (80 lg/lane) were separated on precast\nSDS\u2013PAGE (10% resolving gel with 5% stacking) and semi-dry\ntransferred to the polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PVDF, Mil-\nlipore, USA). Membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature\nwith blocking buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk powder in Tris\nbuffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), and probed with\n1:500 (or 1:200) diluted primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech-\nnology, USA) specific for the target protein. Membranes were incu-\nbated at 4 \ufffdC overnight, followed by incubation for 1 h at room\ntemperature with a 1:5000 diluted HRP-linked secondary antibod-\nies goat antimouse IgG (Zhongshan Goldenbridge Biotechnology\nCo., Ltd., China). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using\nthe enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce, USA) following\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Images were captured by Omega\n16ic\u2122 AFP-Imaging System (ULTRA\ufffdLUM, INC., USA), and analyzed\nby Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA).\n\n2.5. Scratch wound migration assay\n\nCell migration was measured using a monolayer scratch injury\nassay, as described previously [22,23]. Briefly, the EA.hy926 cells\n\n\n\n44 Y. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351\nwere seeded on glass chamber slides and cultured until confluence.\nThen, a uniform straight scratch was performed in the cell mono-\nlayer by using a plastic Cell Scrapper (Corning, USA). Monolayers\nwere washed gently, marked (for reference) and photographed\nusing an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-Y system, Ja-\npan). Cells treating without or with 50 ng \ufffdml\ufffd1 anti-CXCR1 or/and\nanti-CXCR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), and laminar shear\nflows were applied in the direction that is orthogonal to the\nwound. Images of the wounds under both static and flow condi-\ntions were acquired at 1, 2, 4 and 8 h. Shear controls (cells were\ntreated without antibodies) were also concurrently performed.\n\n2.6. Assessment of wound closure\n\nEA.hy926 cell migration during the process of wound closure\nwas analyzed using the image analysis software (Image Pro Plus\n6.0, Media Cybernetics, USA). The acquired image was converted\nfrom pixels to micrometers with the use of a calibration image,\nthen the area could be tabulated while an outline of the wound\nwas traced [24,25]. The levels of wound closure could be assessed\nby the ratio of closure area to initial wound as follows:\n\nRn \u00bc\n\u00f0A0 \ufffd An\u00de\n\nA0\n\ufffd 100%\n\nwhere Rn represents the percentage of wound closure; An represents\nthe residual area of wound at the metering point n (h) and A0 rep-\nresents the area of initial wound (Fig. 1).\n\n2.7. Statistical analysis\n\nData were presented as means \u00b1 SD at least 10 images obtained\nfrom three different experiments, unless otherwise indicated. Sta-\ntistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA test using SPSS\n17.0 software package. Differences in means were considered sig-\nnificant if P < 0.05.\n\n3. Results and analysis\n\n3.1. The mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells is\nupregulated by 5.56 dyn/cm2, but is downregulated by 10.02 and\n15.27 dyn/cm2\n\nThe mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was assessed by\nRT-PCR (Fig. 2). Under low shear stress of 5.56 dyn/cm2, a trend\ntoward increasing of the mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 with\nFig. 1. Definition of quantitatively assess the wound closure by the percentage of woun\nwhere Rn represents the percentage of wound closure; An represents the residual area o\nexposure time was observed (Fig. 2B). Specifically, the mRNA expres-\nsion of CXCR1 was significantly increased at 25 min (P < 0.05),\npeaked at 2 h (63.87 \u00b1 9.45% at 2 h vs. 45.27 \u00b1 0.97% under static\nconditions, P < 0.01), subsequently, slight descent occurred at 4 h\n(60.02 \u00b1 1.23% at 4 h vs. 45.27 \u00b1 0.97% under static conditions,\nP < 0.01). The mRNA expression of CXCR2 was significantly in-\ncreased at 30 min (P < 0.05), and peaked at 2 h (37.68 \u00b1 2.7% at 2 h\nvs. 21.4 \u00b1 1.12% under static conditions, P < 0.01), respectively.\n\nUnder 10.02 and 15.27 dyn/cm2, the mRNA expression of CXCR1\nhad an apparent descending trend with exposure time (Fig. 2C and\n2D). It was significantly decreased after 25 min (P < 0.05). Similarly,\nunder 15.27 dyn/cm2, the mRNA expression of CXCR2 also had a dec-\nlinate trend with exposure time (Fig. 2D). It was significantly de-\ncreased at 20 min later (P < 0.05). However, the mRNA expression\nof CXCR2 under 10.02 dyn/cm2 was relatively stable (Fig. 2C).\n\nInterestingly, the mRNA expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 ap-\npeared a fast increase in 30 min \ufffd 1 h (about 9.79% and 6.12%,\nrespectively) under 5.56 dyn/cm2, a rapid decrease in 30 min \ufffd 1 h\n(about 6.52% and 2.01%, respectively) under 10.02 dyn/cm2 and\nalso a rapid decrease in 25 \ufffd 30 min (about 8.16% and 3.70%,\nrespectively) under 15.27 dyn/cm2. These results suggested that a\nrapid onset occurred at different exposure time while cells respond\nto different shear stress.\n\nOverall, these results demonstrated that the mRNA expression\nof CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells was shear stress-dependent.\nIn addition, in all these shear stress conditions, the mRNA expres-\nsion of CXCR1 was much higher than that of CXCR2 (P < 0.01).\n3.2. The protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells is\nalso shear stress-dependent\n\nThe protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was measured by\nWestern blot (Fig. 3). Under low shear stress of 5.56 dyn/cm2, the\nprotein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was increased in 1 \ufffd 4 h\n(P < 0.05 at 1 h, P < 0.01 at 2 and 4 h), peaked at 4 h and maintained\nrelatively stable later. For instance, under low shear stress for 4 h,\nthe protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was respectively in-\ncreased to about 2.3 and 4.3 times than that under static\nconditions.\n\nUnder mid shear stress of 10.02 dyn/cm2, the protein expression\nof CXCR1 and CXCR2 was increased slightly. Specifically, the signif-\nicant increase was observed in the protein expression of CXCR1 at\n2 h (P < 0.05) while not in that of CXCR2.\n\nUnder high shear stress of 15.27 dyn/cm2, the protein expres-\nsion of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was decreased with exposure time.

In order to obtain the relative quantitative values for gene expression, glyceraldehyde-\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endogenous control.

The CXCR1 mRNA and CXCR2 mRNA were both increased under low shear stress (5.56 dyn/cm2), and decreased under high shear stress\n(15.27 dyn/cm2). Bars indicated mean \u00b1 SD, *P < 0.05 vs. static control (the CXCR1 mRNA and the CXCR2 mRNA, respectively), **P < 0.01 vs. static control.\n\nY.

Specially, the\nexpression of the CXCR2 protein declined rapidly in 2 \ufffd 4 h\n(P < 0.01 at 4 h later).\n\nSimilar to above results of the mRNA expression of CXCR1 and\nCXCR2, these results suggested that the protein expression of\nCXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells was also shear stress-depen-\ndent, which was upregulated by 5.56 dyn/cm2, but was downregu-\nlated by 15.27 dyn/cm2.\n3.3. Laminar shear stress enhances the asymmetric EC migration\n\nFig. 4 showed the percentages of the wound closure when\nEA.hy926 cells were exposed to different magnitudes of laminar\nshear stress for various time. It was clear that shear stress caused\nsignificantly faster wound closure than the static control\n(P < 0.05). Specifically, compared with the static control, the per-\ncentages of wound closure induced by 5.56, 10.02 and 15.27 dyn/\ncm2 was respectively increased about 2, 2.4 and 3.3 times at 1 h,\nabout 1.6, 1.9 and 2.5 times at 2 h, about 1.9, 2.4 and 3.1 times at\n4 h, and about 2, 2.4 and 3 times at 8 h. Therefore, it can be con-\ncluded that laminar shear stress enhances the migration of endo-\nthelial cells.\n\nIn particular, under static conditions, cells from both edges of\nthe wound migrated equally to cover the wounded area (Fig. 4A).\nHowever, under 5.56 dyn/cm2 shear stress, the covered area on\neach side of the wound was different. More specifically, cells in\nthe upriver of the wound migrated farther than that in the\ndownriver (Fig. 4A). It could be found distinctly at 8 h. The same\nphenomenon also occurred in the shear conditions of 10.02 and\n15.27 dyn/cm2. It was indicated that the laminar shear flow has a\npushing force to cells in upriver and a retarding force to cells in\ndownriver, which is responsible for the asymmetric migration of\nECs, i.e., the pushing force can enhance the wound closure while\nthe retarding force appears inhibiting effects. In other words, lam-\ninar shear flow provides a traction force for asymmetric cell migra-\ntion along the direction of flow.\n3.4. Laminar shear stress-enhanced EC migration via CXCR1 and\nCXCR2\n\nEA.hy926 cells were treated with 50 ng\ufffdml\ufffd1 anti-CXCR1 and/or\nanti-CXCR2. Then, the shear stress induced wound closure was ob-\ntained as shown in Figs 5\u20137.\n\nUnder 5.56 dyn/cm2 shear stress (Fig. 5), the levels of wound\nclosure were inhibited while cells were treated with anti-CXCR1\nalone (about 43% at 1 h, 45% at 2 h, 42% at 4 h and 42% at 8 h,\nrespectively. P < 0.05 vs. 5.56 dyn/cm2 control), with anti-CXCR2\nalone (about 65% at 2 h, 62% at 4 h and 62% at 8 h, respectively.\nP < 0.05 vs. 5.56 dyn/cm2 control), and with anti-CXCR1 in combi-\nnation with anti-CXCR2 (about 34% at 1 h, 35% at 2 h, 31% at 4 h\nand 29% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 5.56 dyn/cm2 control).\n\nUnder 10.02 dyn/cm2 shear stress (Fig. 6), the levels of wound\nclosure were also inhibited while cells were treated with anti-\nCXCR1 alone (about 43% at 2 h, 39% at 4 h and 40% at 8 h,\n\n\n\nFig. 3. The protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells under laminar shear flow. The protein expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was measured by Western blot.\n(A) EA.hy926 cells were treated with different mechanical stimuli for various time and then proteins were extracted. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the\nenhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce, USA). Images were captured by using Omega 16ic\u2122 AFP-Imaging System (ULTRA\ufffdLUM, INC., USA), and analyzed by Image Pro Plus\n6.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA). (B) Relative quantification of the CXCR1 and CXCR2 proteins in EA.hy926 cells. Western blot analysis showed that CXCR1 and CXCR2 were both\nincreased under 5.56 dyn/cm2, but were both decreased under 15.27 dyn/cm2. Bars indicated mean \u00b1 SD, *P < 0.05 vs. static control (the CXCR1 protein and the CXCR2 protein,\nrespectively), **P < 0.01 vs. static control.\n\n46 Y. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351\nrespectively. P < 0.05 vs. 10.02 dyn/cm2 control), with anti-CXCR2\nalone (about 57% at 2 h, 51% at 4 h and 49% at 8 h, respectively.\nP < 0.05 vs. 10.02 dyn/cm2 control), and with anti-CXCR1 in combi-\nnation with anti-CXCR2 (about 35% at 1 h, 30% at 2 h, 24% at 4 h\nand 37% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 10.02 dyn/cm2 control).\n\nSimilar to those results under shear stress of 5.56 and\n10.02 dyn/cm2, under 15.27 dyn/cm2 shear stress (Fig. 7), the levels\nof wound closure were inhibited while cells were treated with\nanti-CXCR1 alone (about 50% at 1 h, 47% at 2 h, 46% at 4 h and\n48% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 15.27 dyn/cm2 control), with\nanti-CXCR2 alone (about 77% at 1 h, 35% at 2 h, 53% at 4 h and\n60% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 15.27 dyn/cm2 control), and\nwith anti-CXCR1 in combination with anti-CXCR2 (about 46% at\n1 h, 41% at 2 h, 43% at 4 h and 45% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05\nvs. 15.27 dyn/cm2 control).\n\nAs mentioned above, different percentages of wound closures\nwere obtained under different conditions. It was implied that the\nmechanism of CXCR1 and CXCR2 mediating cell migration may\nbe different in various shear conditions. However, the wound clo-\nsure which is depended on shear stress is inhibited by the antibod-\nies at all these magnitudes. These results suggested that laminar\nshear stress-enhanced EC migration via CXCR1 and CXCR2.\n4. Discussion\n\nOur investigation demonstrates CXCR1 and CXCR2 are novel\nmechano-sensors mediating laminar shear stress-induced EC\nmigration. The vascular endothelial cell monolayer is a metaboli-\ncally active monolayer which is constantly exposed to both bio-\nchemical and biomechanical stimuli in the forms of cyclic\nstretch, hydrostatic pressure and shear stress [1]. In vascular\nremodeling, fluid shear stress is a primary stimulus. Blood flow\nin the straight parts of the aorta is a relatively simple laminar flow\nwith a magnitude of shear stress in the range of 10\u201340 dyn/cm2.\nThe flow will become disturbed and unsteady at the atherosclero-\nsis-prone regions of the arterial tree (at curvatures and bifurca-\ntions), and there may occur a secondary flow with low velocities\n[26]. Exposing ECs to low shear stress would lead to an inflamma-\ntory and hence proatherogenic cellular phenotype, whereas sub-\njecting cells to high shear stress results in a phenotype that is\nlargely anti-inflammatory and therefore atheroprotective [6,27].\nShear stress dose-dependently enhances migration of HUVECs,\nwith a maximum at 45 dyn/cm2 laminar shear stress [28]. In pres-\nent study, three levels of shear stress are adopted: a relatively\n\u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 shear stress of 5.56 dyn/cm2 that typifies shear stress levels\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Effect of laminar shear stress on wound closure and EA.hy926 cell migration. (A) Laminar shear stress enhanced the wound closure progression. EA.hy926 cells were\nrespectively exposed to three different levels of laminar shear stress 5.56, 10.02 and 15.27 dyn/cm2 for 1, 4 and 8 h. (B) The percentage of wound closure under different\nlaminar shear stress for various time. Shear stress caused significantly faster wound closure than the static control. The wound closure was increased with the shear stress\nand time. More specifically, cells in the upriver of the wound migrated farther than that in the downriver. It could be found distinctly at 8 h. It was suggested that laminar\nshear flow provides a traction force for cell migration along the direction of flow. Overall, laminar shear stress enhances the asymmetric EC migration. Bars indicated\nmean \u00b1 SD. Control: cells were treated without CXCL8 receptor antibodies in various conditions. *P < 0.05 vs. static control.\n\nY. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351 47\nwithin disturbed flow regions, a relatively \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 shear stress of\n15.27 dyn/cm2 that is typical for undisturbed flow zones within\nlarge arteries, and a relatively \u2018\u2018mid\u2019\u2019 shear stress of 10.02 dyn/\ncm2 reflecting within the physiological range in human major\narteries. Shear stress at all these magnitudes has been shown to\nactivate EC signal transduction and induced the expression of sev-\neral genes in vitro [29].\n\nWounding of EA.hy926 cells confluent monolayer provokes\ncell migration in the direction of the wound under both static\nand flow conditions. Our results show that the wound closure\nof the EA.hy926 cells monolayer on each side covers equally to\nthe wounded area under static conditions, but appears different\nmigrating behaviors under flow conditions. For instance, cells in\nthe upriver of the wound migrate farther than that in the down-\nriver. It indicates that the flow has a pushing force to the cells in\nupriver edge and a retarding force to the cells in downriver edge.\nIn other words, laminar shear flow produces a traction force\nwhich contributes to the cell migration. It is also documented\nby Hsu and Gojova et al. that there exists an asymmetry of the\nspeed profiles between the upriver and the downriver sides in\nthe wounded bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) monolayer\n[21,30]. Recent studies have shown that shear stress-induced\nasymmetric shape and migration direction of ECs are mediated\nthrough Rho and Rac GTPases [31]. Shiu et al. [32] reported that\nshear stress enhances the migration speed of ECs by modulating\nthe biophysical forces of traction through the biochemical activa-\ntion of Rho-associated protein kinase Rhop160ROCK. Therefore,\nshear stress may enhance the asymmetric migration may through\nthe traction and the downstream signaling activation of Rho and\nRac GTPases.\n\nAlbuquerque et al. [24] reported that cell area increases with\ntime even in static monolayer; shear stress significantly enhances\ncell spreading, and shear stress (3 dyn/cm2) also stimulates the\nlargest increase of cell area in both HUVECs and HCAECs. In present\nstudy, we assume that both cell spreading and cell area are invari-\nable under the same shear stress and at the same exposure time.\nHence, the different percentages of wound closure under the same\nconditions are due to cell migration.\n\nAll ELR + CXC chemokines mediating angiogenesis highlights\nthe importance of identifying a common receptor that mediates\ntheir biological function in promoting angiogenesis [33]. The\ncandidate CXC chemokine receptors are CXCR1 and/or CXCR2.\n\n\n\nFig. 5. 5.56 dyn/cm2 shear stress-enhanced wound closure was inhibited by the CXCL8 receptor antibodies. (A) Effect of the CXCL8 receptor antibodies on the wound closure\nprogression induced by 5.56 dyn/cm2 laminar shear stress. (B) The percentages of wound closure under 5.56 dyn/cm2 for various time while cells were respectively treated\nwith anti-CXCR1 alone, anti-CXCR2 alone and anti-CXCR1 in combination with anti-CXCR2. The levels of wound closure were inhibited while cells were treated with anti-\nCXCR1 alone (about 43% at 1 h, 45% at 2 h, 42% at 4 h and 42% at 8 h, respectively.

Bars indicated mean \u00b1 SD. Control: cells were treated without CXCL8 receptor antibodies under 5.56 dyn/cm2. * P < 0.05 vs.\n5.56 dyn/cm2 control.\n\n48 Y. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351\nThe CXCR1 receptor is highly specific for CXCL8, whereas, the\nCXCR2 receptor responds to multiple CXC-chemokines including\nneutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2), growth-related oncogens\n(GROa, b, c), and granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 [17,34].\nAlthough both receptors internalize via arrestin/dynamin-depen-\ndent mechanisms, CXCR2 internalizes more rapidly (\ufffd95% CXCR2\nvs. \ufffd10% CXCR1 in the first 5\u201310 min) and recovers more slowly\n(\ufffd35% CXCR2 vs. 100% of CXCR1 after 90 min) at the leukocyte cell\nsurface than CXCR1 [35,36]. Generally speaking, expression of the\ntwo receptors and their affinity to CXCL8 are different with cell\ntypes. For example, migration is primarily mediated by CXCR1 in\nleukocyte [37], and by CXCR2 in NIH3T3 cells [38]. It is well known\nthat the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 exist on HUVECs\nin vitro [9,16,17]; the expression of CXC chemokine receptors\nmay be affected by culture conditions and various stimuli [39].\nAlthough HUVECs express low levels of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in static\nconditions [9,16,17], both of the mRNA and protein expression of\nCXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells is upregulated by 5.56 dyn/\ncm2 laminar shear stress, but is downregulated by 15.27 dyn/\ncm2. Our results are also confirmed that the mRNA expression of\nCXCR1 and CXCR2 in HUVECs had the same change trend with that\nin EA.hy926 cells (supplement 1).\n\nDifferent flow patterns and magnitudes of shear stress can exert\ndifferent effects on a number of endothelial cells signaling and\ngene and protein expressions [40\u201342]. In vitro experiments using\nparallel-plate flow chamber with cultured endothelial cells have\nshown that the CXCL8 mRNA expression of HUVECs at 2.23 dyn/\ncm2 increased about 68 or 52 times as that at 19. 29 dyn/cm2\n\n[13]. Sustained exposure to low levels of shear (1.8 dyn/cm2) or a\nbrief exposure (<1 h) to 10 dyn/cm2 caused a sustained stimulation\nof endothelin-1 (ET-1) release, but exposure to 6\u201325 dyn/cm2 for\nP6 h dramatically inhibited ET-1 release [43]. According to Malek\net al. [44], the shear stress of arterial level induces endothelial qui-\nescence and an atheroprotective gene expression profile, while the\nlow shear stress, which is prevalent at atherosclerosis-prone sites,\nstimulates an atherogenic phenotype. Our report here is consistent\nwith Malek\u2019s opinion. At the arterial low shear stress area, high\nexpression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 on locally sheared endothelial\ncells mediates cell migration, may be one of the artherogenic\nmechanisms.\n\n\n\nFig. 6. 10.02 dyn/cm2 shear stress-enhanced wound closure was inhibited by the CXCL8 receptor antibodies. (A) Effect of the CXCL8 receptor antibodies on the wound closure\nprogression induced by 10.02 dyn/cm2 laminar shear stress. (B) The percentages of wound closure under 10.02 dyn/cm2 for various time while cells were respectively treated\nwith anti-CXCR1 alone, anti-CXCR2 alone and anti-CXCR1 in combination with anti-CXCR2. The levels of wound closure were also inhibited while cells were treated with\nanti-CXCR1 alone (about 43% at 2 h, 39% at 4 h and 40% at 8 h, respectively. P < 0.05 vs. 10.02 dyn/cm2 control), with anti-CXCR2 alone (about 57% at 2 h, 51% at 4 h and 49% at\n8 h, respectively.

Bars indicated mean \u00b1 SD. Control: cells were treated without CXCL8 receptor antibodies under 10.02 dyn/cm2. *P < 0.05 vs.\n10.02 dyn/cm2 control.\n\nY. Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351 49\nFurthermore, fluid shear stress can modulate functions of endo-\nthelial cells in blood vessels by activating mechano-sensors, signal-\ning pathways, and gene and protein expressions [45]. In order to\nstudy the effect of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EC migration, we have ob-\ntained optimum CXCL8 antibodies concentration under static con-\nditions. The static cultured controls are performed on EA.hy926\ncells at various concentrations of anti-CXCR1 or/and anti-CXCR2,\nwhile the concentration of CXCL8 receptor antibodies is above\n50 ng\ufffdml\ufffd1, the wound closure is not significantly changed (data\nnot shown). Therefore, the CXCL8 receptor antibodies with a con-\ncentration of 50 ng\ufffdml\ufffd1 is chosen for the blockade of the receptors\nCXCR1 and/or CXCR2.\n\nAs expected, the migratory response of EA.hy926 cells induced\nby shear stress can be significantly suppressed by anti-CXCR1\nalone, anti-CXCR2 alone or anti-CXCR1 in combination with anti-\nCXCR2, respectively.\n\nOur results have demonstrated that the receptors CXCR1 and\nCXCR2 participate in the EC sensing of mechanical stimulations,\nand the shear stress-induced EC migration can be inhibited while\nantibodies against CXCR1 and CXCR2. It was suggested that CXCR1\nand CXCR2 played important roles in mediating the endothelial cell\nmigration induced by shear stress at all these magnitudes,\nalthough there maybe exist other receptors mediating shear\nstress-induced endothelial cell migration. Therefore, antibodies\nagainst CXCR1 and CXCR2 can inhibit EC migration that induced\nby shear stress at all these magnitudes.\n\nOverall, cell migration depends on whether CXCR1 and CXCR2\nare blocked, on whether flow is applied, and on what magnitudes\nof shear stress is exerted on cells.\n\nIn particular, under 15.27 dyn/cm2 shear stress, the expression\nof CXCR1 and CXCR2 in EA.hy926 cells is downregulated. But the\nwound closure, which can be blocked by functional CXCL8 antibod-\nies, is greatly enhanced. Furthermore, the immunofluorescence as-\nsay was used to determine CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression on the\nsurface of EA.hy926 cells. Our results showed that both CXCR1\nand CXCR2 were expression on the surface of ECs. The expression\nof them enhanced by 5.56 dyn/cm2 shear stress, but inhibited by\n15.27 dyn/cm2 shear stress, especially exposure for 4 h. It was\nsuggested that the distribution of CXCR1 and CXCR2 on the surface\nof ECs was shear stress-dependent (supplement 2). Our results\n\n\n\nFig. 7. 15.27 dyn/cm2 shear stress-enhanced wound closure was inhibited by the CXCL8 receptor antibodies.

Zeng et al. / Cytokine 53 (2011) 42\u201351\nindicated that CXCR1 and CXCR2 are mechano-sensors mediating\nlaminar shear stress-induced EC migration. The traction force\nmaybe has pure classical physics effects on cell migration that is\nthe subject of Newton\u2019s third law of motion.\n\nWith respect to cell motility, reorganization of the actin cyto-\nskeleton is the primary mechanism [46]. Singh et al. showed that\nknock-down of CXR1 and CXCR2 affects CXCL-8-induced actin\nreorganization and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in melanoma cells,\nand then decreased the melanoma cell migration [47]. Schraufstat-\nter et al. showed that lung microvascular endothelial cells express\nCXCR1 and CXCR2 and CXCL-8 activates Rho and Rac signaling\npathways through these receptors [17]. Interestingly, CXCL-8 ini-\ntially activates Rho and actin stress fiber formation in endothelial\ncells due to activation of the CXCR1; at later time points, Rac is\nactivated in a CXCR2-dependent fashion, leading to cell retraction\nand gap formation between neighboring cells [17]. Our next work\nwill further validate whether there are differences between CXCR1\nand CXCR2 in mechanical signal transduction.\n\nIt has become increasingly clear that the CXCL8 receptors\nCXCR1 and CXCR2 exhibit critical effects in cell migration, which\ncontributes to angiogenesis relevant to cancer. Additionally, it is\nknown that CXCL8 signaling activates members of the Rho\nGTPase family via the receptors CXCR1/2; then activates a num-\nber of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., Src family kinases and\nFAK) that regulate the architecture of the cell cytoskeleton and\nits interaction with the surrounding extracellular environment\n[10]. Perhaps traction and the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 and\nCXCR2 have a common downstream signaling pathway such as\nthe activation of Rho and Rac GTPases. These novel molecular\ntargets can be discovered to facilitate the development of new\ntherapeutic strategies for prevention and treatment of cardiovas-\ncular diseases and cancer.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis study was supported in part by grant from National Natu-\nral Science Foundation of China (Nos. 30570450, 10772127,\n10972148), Sichuan Youth Science & Technology Foundation (No.\n06ZQ026-009), and Program for New Century Excellent Talents in\nUniversity of China (No. NCET-06-0791).\n\n\n\nY.
