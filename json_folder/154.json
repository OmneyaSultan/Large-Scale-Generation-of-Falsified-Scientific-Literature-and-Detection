However, the\ncell-signaling pathways linking interleukin-8 (IL-8), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and dexa-\nmethasone in hPDL cells have not been well elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)\nkinases in dexamethasone- and TNF-a-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression in hPDL cells. IL-8 production was measured by\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. MAP kinase\nactivation and IjB degradation were determined by Western blot analysis, and ICAM-1 expression was determined by RT-PCR and\nFACS analysis. TNF-a increased IL-8 mRNA expression and protein secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Dexamethasone\nsuppressed TNF-a-induced IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, dexamethasone inhibited TNF-a-induced phos-\nphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs), IjB degradation, and NF-jB activation. Selective inhibitors\nfor ERKs and p38 attenuated TNF-a-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression in the presence and absence of dexamethasone, indicating\nthat MAP kinases play a role in the response of hDPL cells to TNF-a. Furthermore, these results suggest that inflammatory cytokine-\nand dexamethasone-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1, produced via a MAP kinase pathway, may serve as an important mediator of PDL\nimmunoregulation involved in bone remodeling during orthodontic tooth movement.\n\ufffd 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nDuring orthodontic tooth movement, applied mechani-\ncal loading induces inflammation in the periodontal liga-\nment (PDL).

Kim).\nspace, where they differentiate into mature osteoclasts. The\nosteoclasts then resorb alveolar bone upon stimulation by\nPDL-derived cytokines [3]. The mechanisms by which\ninflammatory cytokines mediate osteoclast formation and\nbone resorption are not completely understood, however,\nparticularly in human PDL (hPDL) cells.\n\nThe chemotactic cytokine known as interleukin 8 (IL-8)\nand the cell-surface adhesion molecule known as intercellu-\nlar adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) are major mediators of\ninflammation that contribute to sequestration of neutro-\nphils at sites of tissue injury [4]. IL-8 is a member of the\nCXC chemokine family of cytokines that were originally\nidentified as monocyte-derived factors capable of attracting\n\nmailto:eckwkop@wonkwang.ac.kr\n\n\n68 H.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376\nand activating neutrophils [5,6]. IL-8 is produced by a vari-\nety of cell types, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and\nendothelial cells, in response to inflammation and injury\n[7]. IL-8 is increasingly being recognized as a multifunc-\ntional cytokine with other activities, in addition to its activ-\nity as a chemokine.\n\nIn bone, IL-8 is synthesized by osteoblasts and osteo-\nclasts [8]. Bendre et al. [9] demonstrated that the actions\nof IL-8 related to bone resorption are both indirect and\ndirect. IL-8 indirectly stimulates expression of osteoblast\nreceptor activator of NF-jB ligand (RANKL), and it\ndirectly affects the osteoclastogenic response of human\nosteoclast precursors. Recently, Tuncer et al. [10] observed\nthat orthodontic forces lead to an increase in IL-8 and sub-\nsequent accumulation of neutrophils, suggesting that IL-8\ntriggers bone remodeling. Thus, IL-8 may be important\nin regulation of bone formation and resorption during\northodontic tooth movement.\n\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a is an inflammatory cyto-\nkine that appears to be an important mediator of bone\ndestruction in inflammatory disease [11]. TNF-a is primar-\nily produced by activated monocytes, macrophages, and\nosteoblasts, and it stimulates osteoclast differentiation\nand osteoclastic bone resorption in vitro and in vivo [12].\nVarious studies have shown that prostaglandin E (PGE),\nIL-1b, and TNF-a are increased in human gingival crevic-\nular fluid during orthodontic tooth movement [13,14]. Fur-\nthermore, TNF-a has recently been reported to enhance\nexpression of IL-8 mRNA and secretion of IL-8 protein\nin various cell types [8,15,16]. Therefore, TNF-a is believed\nto play a key role in the biological processes involved in\northodontic tooth movement.\n\nThe roles of glucocorticoids in osteoclast formation and\nactivation have been extensively examined in vivo and\nin vitro, with conflicting results. These osteotropic factors\nare thus assumed to play different roles in different micro-\nenvironments and cell types [17,18]. In a study by Pharoah\nand Heersche [19], dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorti-\ncoid analog, inhibited the formation of osteoclast-like cells\nin bone marrow cultures. However, in other studies, gluco-\ncorticoids increased osteoclast formation and activity\nthrough both direct and indirect mechanisms [17,18,20].\nHirayama et al. [21] reported that dexamethasone directly\naffected osteoclast formation and activity, stimulating the\nproliferation and differentiation of human osteoclast pre-\ncursors, and inhibiting the bone resorption activity of\nmature osteoclasts. In the present study, we investigated\nthe effects of dexamethasone in the presence of various\nosteotropic factors to gain additional insight regarding its\nrole in hDPL cells.\n\nThe mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPKs)\ncomprise well-conserved signaling pathways and include\nextracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-ter-\nminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPK. These activated\nkinases initiate a cascade of protein phosphorylation that\nactivates nuclear transcription factors, such as NF-jB,\nand AP-1. These transcription factors subsequently pro-\nmote expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,\nand ICAMs [22,23].\n\nWe hypothesized that orthodontic tooth movement\ncauses inflammation and release of IL-8- and ICAM-1-in-\nducing cytokines by activating MAPK signaling pathways\nin hPDL cells. In the present study, we focused on IL-8\nsecretion and ICAM-1 expression because these molecules\nare known to play important roles in the recruitment of cir-\nculating inflammatory cells. We investigated the effects of\nTNF-a and dexamethasone on the production of chemo-\nkines and ICAM-1 via activation of MAPK signaling path-\nways in primary cultured hPDL cells.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Reagents\n\nTNF-a and polyclonal goat anti-human IL-8 antibodies\n(Abs) were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,\nMN, USA). SB203580 and PD98059 were purchased from\nCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA, USA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-\nhuman IL-8 Abs was purchased from Endogen (Woburn,\nMA, USA). Abs against p38 kinase, ERK1/2, and the\nAbs specific to the phosphorylated forms of these proteins\nwere purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,\nMA, USA). Horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated\nanti-rabbit IgG was from Amersham Biosciences (Little\nChalfont, UK). Anti-human I-jBa or antiphospho-I-jBa\nwere from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA,\nUSA). Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM),\nKGM medium (Clonetics), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and\nother tissue culture reagents were purchased from Gibco-\nBRL (Grand Island, NY, USA). Dexamethasone and all\nother chemicals were bought from Sigma Chemical Co.\n(St. Louis, MO, USA) unless indicated otherwise.\n\n2.2. Primary culture of hPDL cells\n\nhPDL cells were isolated with an explant culture tech-\nnique from patients, with an age under 25 years undergoing\northodontic treatment by following described methods [24].\nInformed written consent from donors were obtained for\nuse of the tissues. Patients signed the corresponding\ninformed consent approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard at Wonkwang University for used of the tissues.\nBriefly, these tissues were cut into 1 mm2 explants and\nplaced on a 100 mm culture dishes (Nunc, Naperville, IL,\nUSA) containing 10,000 U/ml of penicillin G sodium,\n10,000 lg/ml of streptomycin sulphate, 25 lg/ml of\namphotericin B, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine\nserum (FBS; Gibco-BRL, Grand island, NY, USA) at\n37 \ufffdC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%\nair. After 2 or 3 days, cells started to outgrow from the\nexplants. When the primary cell culture reached conflu-\nence, cells were detached with 0.025% trypsin and 0.05%\nEDTA, diluted with culture medium, and then subcultured\nin a ratio of 1:4. Cell cultures between the 5th and 7th\n\n\n\nH.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376 69\npassage were used in this study. Alkaline phosphatase\nactivity for 3 days was checked before the experiments.\n\n2.3. ELISA for IL-8 protein measurement\n\nhPDL cells were seeded at 2 \u00b7 105 into 24-well plates\n(Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY, USA) and\ngrown until formation of confluent monolayers, reaching\na final density of 5 \u00b7 105 cells/well. Monolayers were then\nincubated for 4\u201348 h in a fresh medium containing stimuli\nas indicated. The supernatants were collected, cleared by\ncentrifugation, and kept at \ufffd20 \ufffdC until evaluation by\nELISA. For measurement of IL-8 concentrations in cell\nculture supernatants, 96-well microtiter plates (MaxiSorp;\nNunc) were coated with 0.2 lg/well goat anti-human IL-8\nAbs (R&D Systems) in 50 ll of PBS at 4 \ufffdC overnight. All\nfurther steps were conducted at room temperature. After\nwashing three times with PBS, nonspecific binding sites\nwere blocked by incubation with 150 ll PBS + 1% BSA/\n0.05% Tween 20/well for 2 h. After three washes with\nPBS, 50 ll of samples or IL-8 standards were added and\nincubated for 2 h. As a second Ab, 0.05 lg/well polyclonal\nrabbit anti-human IL-8 (Endogen) was added and incu-\nbated for 2 h. As a third Ab, alkaline phosphatase-labeled\nmonoclonal mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) was\ndiluted in 50 ll of PBS + 0.1% BSA/0.05% Tween 20 to\n1:50,000 and incubated for 2 h. Finally, alkaline phospha-\ntase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma\u2013Aldrich)\nwas added at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 0.1 M glycine\nbuffer (pH 10.4) containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM\nZnCl2. After overnight incubation, plates were read at\n405 nm on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sun-\nnyvale, CA, USA). The detection limit of the ELISA\nwas 30 pg/ml.\n\n2.4. Cell viability assay\n\nViable cells were detected using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-\n2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye, which\nforms blue formazan crystals that are reduced by mito-\nchondrial dehydrogenase present in living cells. Briefly,\n2 \u00b7 104 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and cultured\novernight for cell attachment. After cell treatment, 50 ll\nof MTT solution (0.5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each\nwell and incubated for 4 h. To each well, 50 ll of DMSO\nwere added. The plates were then shaken until the crystals\nhad dissolved. Reduced MTT was then measured spectro-\nphotometrically in a dual beam microtiter plate reader at\n570 nm.\n\n2.5. RNA isolation and RT-PCR\n\nCells were grown in 60-mm culture dishes and incubated\nfor 4\u201324 h in a fresh medium containing stimuli as indicat-\ned. After discarding growth medium, total RNA was iso-\nlated from cells using easy-Blue (iNtRON Biotechnology,\nDaejon, Korea), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nReverse transcription of the RNA was performed using\nAccuPower RT PreMix (Bioneer, Daejon, Korea). One\nmicrogram of RNA and 20 pmol/ll primers were preincu-\nbated at 70 \ufffdC for 5 min and transferred to a mixture tube.\nThe reaction volume was 20 ll. cDNA synthesis was per-\nformed at 42 \ufffdC for 60 min, followed by RT inactivation\nat 94 \ufffdC for 5 min. Thereafter, the RT-generated DNA\n(2\u20135 ll) was amplified using AccuPower PCR PreMix (Bio-\nneer). The primers used for cDNA amplification and PCR\nconditions were as follows:\n\n0\nIL-8, 289 bp\n (F) 5 -ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGT\nGGCT-3 0\n(R) 5 0-TCTCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAAC\nTTCTC-3 0\nICAM-1,\n238 bp\n(F) 5 0-TATGGCAACGACTCCTTCT-3 0\n(R) 5 0-CATTCAGCGTCACCTTGG-3 0\nGAPDH,\n306 bp\n(F) 5 0-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT\nCGTAT-3 0\n(R) 5 0-AGCCTTCTCCA TGGTGGTG\nAAGAC-3 0\nIL-8; an initial denaturation at 94 \ufffdC for 5 min; 25 cycles\nat 94 \ufffdC for 30 s, at 62 \ufffdC for 30 s, and at 72 \ufffdC for 30 s,\nand ICAM-1; 30 cycles at 94 \ufffdC for 45 s, at 58 \ufffdC for\n1 min, and at 72 \ufffdC for 1 min, GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase); 25 cycles at 94 \ufffdC for 30 s,\nat 62 \ufffdC for 30 s, at 72 \ufffdC for 30 s. PCR products were\nresolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium\nbromide.\n2.6. Phosphorylation of p38 and ERK MAP kinase\n\nCells were stimulated according to designated experi-\nmental protocols. Proteins were extracted with an extrac-\ntion buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4, containing\n150 mM NaCl, 1% nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxy-\ncholate, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovana-\ndate, 1 mM 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mg/ml leupeptin,\n10 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benze-\nnesulfonyl fluoride). Activation of MAP kinase was exam-\nined by determining its phosphorylation state using the\nantibodies specific to the phosphorylated forms of p38\nMAP kinase and ERK-1 and ERK-2.\n2.7. Western blot analysis\n\nProtein samples (50 lg) were mixed with an equal vol-\nume of 2\u00b7 SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then\nseparated through 8\u201315% SDS\u2013PAGE gels. After electro-\nphoresis, proteins were transferred to nylon membranes\nby electrophoretic transfer. The membranes were blocked\nin 5% dry milk (1 h), rinsed, and incubated with primary\nantibodies (diluted at 1:500 or 1:1000) in TBS overnight\nat 4 \ufffdC. Primary antibody was then removed by washing\n\n\n\n70 H.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376\nthe membranes four times in TBS, and labeled by incubat-\ning with 0.1 mg/ml peroxidase-labeled secondary antibod-\nies (against mouse and rabbit) for 1 h. Following three\nwashes in TBS, bands were visualized by ECL and exposed\nto X-ray film.\n\n2.8. Surface ICAM-1 expression by flow cytometry\n\nMonolayers of PDL cells were detached by incubation\nwith trypsin 0.25% and EDTA 0.25% in calcium- and mag-\nnesium-free PBS (pH 7.2). For single-label flow cytometric\nanalysis of ICAM-1 expression, 2 \u00b7 105 cells/ml were incu-\nbated for 30 min on ice with 2.5 ll of anti-human ICAM-1\nMAb in a total volume of 500 ll of PBS containing\n0.05 mM EDTA, BSA 0.1% and FBS 0.05%. After washing\ntwice, cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with 500 ll of\na dilution (1 in 100) of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-\nconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (DAKO). Cells were\nwashed twice with PBS then the immunofluorescence of\nthe FITC single label was measured with a flow cytometer\n(Beckton\u2013Dickinson, CS, USA).\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\n\nThe results were expressed as means \u00b1 SD of three inde-\npendent experiments. Statistical significances were com-\npared between each treated group and control by the\nStudent\u2019s t-test. Each experiment was repeated at least\nthree times and yielded comparable results. Values with\np < 0.05 were considered significant.\nFig. 1. Effect of TNF-a on expression of IL-8 mRNA and protein in hPDL cell\nthe time indicated (A and B).

Effect of TNF-a on expression of IL-8 mRNA and\nprotein in hPDL cells\n\nWe first determined the time course for IL-8 secretion in\nhPDL cells in response to TNF-a, as well as the optimal\nTNF-a concentration for this response. Cells were treated\nwith TNF-a, the cell culture media were harvested, and\nthe level of secreted IL-8 protein was determined by\nELISA. TNF-a-induced IL-8 secretion was found to\nsteadily increase in a time- and dose-dependent manner\n(Fig. 1A and C). Maximal induction was seen after 48 h\nof exposure to 20 ng/ml TNF-a. When the level of IL-8\nmRNA in the induced cultures was analyzed by RT-\nPCR, the increase in IL-8 protein secretion correlated with\nthe accumulation of IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 1B and D).\n\n3.2. Effects of dexamethasone on TNF-a-induced expression\nof IL-8 mRNA, IL-8 protein and cell viability in hPDL cells\n\nWe next investigated the effect of dexamethasone on\nTNF-a-induced production of IL-8 and cell viability in\nhPDL cells. Treatment of cell cultures with dexamethasone\n(10\ufffd9, 10\ufffd8, and 10\ufffd7 M) significantly inhibited the induc-\ntion of IL-8 mRNA expression, protein secretion and cell\nviability by TNF-a (10 ng/ml), in a concentration-depen-\ndent manner (Fig. 2A\u2013C). In particular, treatment with\n10\ufffd7 M dexamethasone dramatically decreased levels of\nIL-8 protein, mRNA and cell viability. These results show\ns.

Effects of dexamethasone on phosphorylation of p38 and\nERK1/2 MAPKs in TNF-a-stimulated hPDL cells\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the\nERK/p38 pathway in HT-29, HeLa, human airway epi-\nthelial, and mast cells attenuates IL-8 secretion [25\u201327].\nIn the present study, we examined the effects of dexameth-\nasone on TNF-a-induced MAPK phosphorylation by\nA\n\nFig. 3. Effect of dexamethasone on phosphorylation of p38, ERK and JNK M\n(10 ng/ml) and dexamethasone (10\ufffd9, 10\ufffd8, 10\ufffd7 M) for 30 min (A) and 60 m\nobtained in three independent experiments.\nincubating hPDL cells with TNF-a (10 ng/ml) and dexa-\nmethasone (10\ufffd9, 10\ufffd8, and 10\ufffd7 M) for 30 or 60 min.\nPhosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs was then\nassessed by Western blot analysis.

Effects of dexamethasone on phosphorylation and\n\ndegradation of inhibitor-jB (IjB) in TNF-a-stimulated\nhPDL cells\n\nStimulation of cells with inducers such as TNF-a leads\nto rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation\nof IjB. Degradation of IjB allows NF-jB to translocate to\nthe nucleus, bind to its specific promoter elements, and\nactivate gene transcription. Since NF-jB activation is\nimportant for the regulation of IL-8 [28], we examined\nthe effect of dexamethasone on TNF-a-induced NF-jB\nactivation. Cells were exposed to TNF-a for 15 min, cell\nlysates were prepared, and IjB degradation and phosphor-\nylation were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-IjBa\nand anti-phospho-IjBa antibodies, respectively. IjBa\nbecame almost undetectable 15 min after TNF-a treat-\nment, and it returned to the original level 1 h after TNF-\na treatment (Fig. 4A).\n\nWe next examined whether dexamethasone had any\neffect on TNF-a-induced phosphorylation of IjBa pro-\ntein, inasmuch as IjBa phosphorylation is reported to\nbe important for IjB degradation [28]. Phosphorylation\nof IjB protein after TNF-a treatment was dramatically\ninhibited by dexamethasone, in a concentration-depen-\ndent manner (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that dexa-\nmethasone may suppress TNF-a-induced IL-8 gene\nFig. 4. Effect of dexamethasone on phosphorylation and degradation of IjB in\nml) for time indicated (A).

Effects of p38 and ERK inhibitor on IL-8 expression in\n\ndexamethasone- and TNF-a-stimulated hPDL cells\n\nSince our results indicated that p38 and ERK are inhib-\nited by TNF-a exposure, we next examined whether these\nMAPKs are required for induction of pro-inflammatory\ngene expression by TNF-a. Cells were pre-treated with\n20 lM SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK) or\n20 lM PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of ERK kinase) for\n1 h. They were then treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-a and\n10\ufffd7 M dexamethasone for 24 h, supernatant fractions\nwere collected, and the amount of IL-8 protein secreted\nwas determined by ELISA (Fig. 5A).\n\nPre-treatment of hPDL cells with either of the selective\ninhibitors for p38 (SB203580) or ERK kinase (PD98059)\nblocked TNF-a-induced IL-8 production (Fig. 5A). As seen\nin Fig. 5B, the level of secreted IL-8 protein correlated with\nthe level of accumulated IL-8 mRNA. With dexamethasone\n(10\ufffd7 M) treatment, the inhibitory effect of pre-treatment on\nIL-8 mRNA and protein expression was also noted (Fig. 5A\nand B). These results implicate the tyrosine p38 and ERK1/2\npathways in the mechanism by which dexamethasone and\nTNF-a induce IL-8 expression.\nTNF-a stimulated hPDL cells.

Effects of p38 and ERK inhibitor on ICAM-1 expression\n\nin dexamethasone- and TNF-a-stimulated hPDL cells\n\nBecause of similarities in the kinetics of induction of IL-\n8 and ICAM-1 mRNA, and in the structures of the IL-8\nand ICAM-1 gene promoters, we hypothesized that MAP-\nKs may also regulate ICAM-1 expression. Both IL-8 and\nICAM-1 mRNA were rapidly up-regulated in hPDL fol-\nlowing stimulation with TNF-a (Fig. 6A), but simulta-\nneous treatment with dexamethasone suppressed the\ninduction of ICAM-1 by TNF-a (Fig. 6A\u2013C).\n\nRT-PCR analysis indicated that pre-treatment of hPDL\ncells with SB203580 or PD98059 inhibited induction of\nICAM-1 mRNA expression by TNF-a, with or without\ndexamethasone (Fig. 6A). The effects of MAPK inhibitors\non the surface expression of ICAM-1 were also examined\nby FACS analysis. The results of the FACS analysis, which\nare shown in a conventional flow cytometric histogram on\na log scale in Fig. 6B and C, are consistent with the RT-\nPCR analysis. SB203580 inhibited TNF-a-induced surface\nexpression of ICAM-1 in the presence and absence of\ndexamethasone (Fig. 6B). PD98059 also blocked TNF-a-\ninduced surface expression of ICAM-1 in the absence of\ndexamethasone, but not in its presence (Fig. 6C). These\nresults suggest that the mechanisms by which dexametha-\nsone and TNF-a induce ICAM-1 expression do not involve\nthe tyrosine p38/ERK1/2 pathway in the same way.\n\n4.

They lose their osteoblast-like characteristics\n[29] and express genes that are associated with catabolic\nprocesses, including bone resorption, as evidenced by\nstudies on the mechanism of orthodontic tooth move-\nment [29,30].\n\nOrthodontic tooth movement activates the secretion of\nosteolytic cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a that\nare produced by macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts\n[13,14]. IL-8, which was originally identified as a mono-\ncyte-derived factor capable of attracting and activating\nneutrophils, is increasingly being recognized as multifunc-\ntional. It appears to be important in the regulation of bone\nresorption, and its diverse functions have been investigated\nin a variety of cell types [5,6]. However, the effects of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoids on IL-8 pro-\nduction in hPDL cells have not previously been studied\nin detail.\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the production and\nsecretion of IL-8 from hPDL cells that were treated with\nthe pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a in the presence\nand absence of dexamethasone. These treatments were cho-\nsen to mimic the inflammatory responses of bone resorp-\ntion during orthodontic tooth movement. IL-8 secretion\nwas significantly enhanced by treatment with TNF-a, in a\ndose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A and B), and\nexpression of IL-8 mRNA was also enhanced, in a time-de-\npendent manner (Fig. 1C and D). These results are in\naccordance with those of previous studies using various\nhuman cell types, including osteoclasts [8], endothelial cells\none and TNF-a stimulated PDL cells by RT-PCR (A), and FACS-analysis\n1 h, post-treated with TNF-a (10 ng/ml) and dexamethasone (10\ufffd7 M) for\nT-PCR. Surface ICAM-1 expression by flow cytometry was analyzed by\neled IgG. Nontreated cells were used as a control. The experiments were\n\n\n\n74 H.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376\n[15], and airway smooth-muscle cells [16], and they indicate\nthat TNF-a-dependent up-regulation of IL-8 is due to an\nincrease in transcription.\n\nOne characteristic feature of many cytokines is that their\nactions involve interactive networks or cascades that are\noften stimulatory. However, our present data demonstrate\nthat dexamethasone inhibits TNF-a-induced secretion of\nIL-8 (Fig. 2A and B), providing an example, therefore, of\nan equally interesting inhibitory interaction. In a previous\nstudy by Fujisawa et al. [31], dexamethasone was found\nto have no effect on TNF-a-induced IL-8 production, but\nthis lack of effect may be related to the low concentration\nof dexamethasone used. Additionally, we did not observe\na significant effect for dexamethasone at the concentration\n(10\ufffd9 M) used in their study; however, at higher concentra-\ntions (10\ufffd8 and 10\ufffd7 M), it significantly inhibited TNF-a-\ninduced IL-8 production in our study, and in those of\nRothe et al. [8], Nyhlen et al. [15], and Pang et al. [16].\nThese results suggest that dexamethasone plays a impor-\ntant role in the regulation of bone remodeling and that this\neffect is due to inhibition of TNF-a-induced IL-8 secretion\nduring orthodontic tooth movement.\n\nIL-8 production in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli\nis dependent on MAPK- and NF-jB-mediated pathways\n[32]. NF-jB comprises specific, heterodimeric complexes\nthat are inactive in the cytoplasm of resting cells, where\neach NF-jB complex is bound to one of the IjB proteins.\nStimulus-induced activation of the NF-jB-inducing kinase\ncauses it to phosphorylate the IjB kinase complexes [33].\nUbiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of\nIjB follows, freeing NF-jB to translocate to the nucleus,\nwhere it interacts with its target DNA motifs and regulates\nthe secretion of various chemokines, including IL-8 [33,34].\n\nIjB kinases are phosphorylated by NF-jB-inducing\nkinases, which activate various MAPKs, including the\nstress-activated protein kinase JNK [35]. Recently, the\nIL-6 and IL-8 genes have been identified as new targets reg-\nulated by JNK [36]. Other studies have shown that (i)\nERK1/2 and JNK play an important role in streptococcal\nprotein I/II-mediated synthesis of IL-6 and IL-8 in fibro-\nblast-like synoviocytes [37]; (ii) p38 MAPK plays a crucial\nrole in IL-6 and IL-8 production by TNF-a- or IL-1b-stim-\nulated rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts [38]; and (iii) p38\nand ERK MAPKs contribute to TNF-a-stimulated IL-8\nsecretion by intestinal epithelial cells [39].\n\nTo investigate the connection between the activation of\np38 and ERK and induction of IL-8, we evaluated the\neffects of JNK and ERK pathway inhibitors (SB203580\nand PD98059, respectively) and an anti-inflammatory\nagent (dexamethasone) on NF-jB, MAPK activation,\nand IL-8 production in hPDL cells exposed to TNF-a.\nDexamethasone inhibited TNF-a-mediated phosphoryla-\ntion of p38 and ERK1/2 (Fig. 3), indicating a possible spe-\ncific interaction with the p38/ERK1/2 signal pathway.\nMoreover, dexamethasone inhibited TNF-a-mediated IjB\ndegradation (Fig. 4) and NF-jB binding to DNA, provid-\ning evidence that dexamethasone regulates expression of\nthe pro-inflammatory target gene, IL-8, by suppressing\nthe NF-jB-activating signal pathway in hPDL cells.\n\nAlthough the importance of ERK1/2 in IL-8 expression\nhas been described in previous studies [40,41], the role of\np38 MAPK in IL-8 expression is unclear. In a study by Rid-\nley et al. [42], SB203580 had no effect on IL-8 expression in\nIL-1-stimulated human fibroblast or umbilical vein endothe-\nlial cells. On the other hand, in a study by Zu et al. [43], acti-\nvation of p38 MAPK was required for stimulation of IL-8\nproduction by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating\nfactor, lipopolysaccharide, or TNF-a in neutrophils. In the\npresent study, both the p38 inhibitor and the ERK inhibitor\nefficiently blocked IL-8 protein production in response to\nTNF-a/dexamethasone, as shown by ELISA (Fig. 5A) and\nsemi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5B). Thus, the effect of\nstimulating agents on IL-8 regulation appears to vary with\ncell type and the particular agent used.\n\nICAM-1, a cell surface adhesion molecule, is involved in\nmany biological responses, including leukocyte adhesion to\nendothelial cells. It is expressed on several types of cells,\nincluding endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and leukocytes,\nand it is up-regulated at sites of inflammation by pro-in-\nflammatory cytokines [44\u201346]. Evidence for ICAM-1\nexpression in the PDL was reported by Toms et al. [47],\nwho used immunohistochemical analysis to examine the\neffect of endotoxin exposure on rat PDL blood vessels.\nFurthermore, Joe et al. [48] demonstrated that IL-1b causes\nup-regulation of ICAM-1 in PDL cells. However, whether\nICAM-1 functions as a signaling molecule to transmit bio-\nchemical signals in hPDL cells remains unknown. In the\npresent study using hDPL cells, we found that TNF-a\ninduces ICAM-1 expression, that dexamethasone signifi-\ncantly inhibits this response, and that this response is con-\nsistent with the effect of TNF-a on IL-8 (Fig. 6). Hence,\nthis report constitutes the first description of a signaling\nrole for ICAM-1 in hPDL cells.\n\nTransformed intestinal epithelial cells have been shown\nto express IL-8 and ICAM-1 both constitutively and upon\ntreatment with TNF-a [44,45], and p38 MAPK plays a role\nin the regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as\nIL-8, and adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 [23,46].\nThus, we examined whether MAPKs regulate ICAM-1\nexpression in dexamethasone- and TNF-a-stimulated\nhPDL cells at the level of translation or transcription.\nInterestingly, we found that SB203580 dramatically sup-\npresses ICAM-1 expression by hPDL cells exposed to\nTNF-a with or without dexamethasone, as shown by\nsemi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6A) and FACS analysis.\nPD98059 pretreatment blocked TNF-a-induced ICAM-1\nexpression, whereas did not affect ICAM-1 expression in\ncells simultaneously treated with TNF-a and dexametha-\nsone. According to Jijon et. al. [26], neither PD98059 nor\nSB203580 reduced the number of ICAM-1 molecule fol-\nlowing TNF-a treatment on the intestinal epithelium. The\nreason for this difference may reflect compensatory effect\nof dexamethasone for TNF-a, and may activate different\ntarget MAP kinase in different cell types.\n\n\n\nH.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376 75\nThe present study demonstrates that hPDL cells secrete\nthe potent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8, and that TNF-\na exposure stimulates production of IL-8 by these cells.\nFurthermore, dexamethasone inhibits the effect of TNF-a\non IL-8 expression in these cells by blocking MAPKs and\nthe IjB/NF-jB pathway. The up- or down-regulation of\nboth ICAM-1 and IL-8 in response to TNF-a or dexameth-\nasone appears to be mediated by p38 and ERK MAPKs.\nThus, these factors may play an important role in the\nimmunoregulation of bone remodeling during orthodontic\ntooth movement. Further studies elucidating the interac-\ntions among other osteotropic factors in hDPL cells should\nlead to techniques that will facilitate effective and rapid\northodontic tooth movement.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Davidovitch Z.
