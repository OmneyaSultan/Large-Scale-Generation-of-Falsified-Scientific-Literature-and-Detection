MicroRNAs  (miRNAs)  can  act as  oncogenes  or tumor-suppressor  genes  in  human  malignancy.  The\nmiR-34  family  is comprised  of  tumor-suppressive  miRNAs,  and  its  reduced  expression  by  methylation\nhas  been  reported  in  various  cancers,  including  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC).  In  this  study,  we\ninvestigated  the alteration  and  tumor-suppressive  impact  of  miR-34s  in SCLC.  The  methylation  of  miR-\n34a and  miR-34b/c  was  observed  in  4 (36%)  and  7  (64%)  of  11  SCLC  cell  lines,  respectively.  Among  the  27\nSCLC  clinical  specimens,  miR-34a  and  miR-34b/c  were  methylated  in  4  (15%)  and  18  (67%),  respectively.\nIn  contrast,  13  (28%)  miR-34a  methylated  cases  and  12  (26%)  miR-34b/c  methylated  cases  were found\nin  47  NSCLC  primary  tumors.  The  frequency  of  miR-34b/c  methylation  was  significantly  higher  in  SCLC\nthan  in  NSCLC  (p  <  0.001).  The  expressions  of  miR-34s  were  reduced  in methylated  cell lines  and  tumors\nand restored  after  5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine  treatment,  indicating  that  methylation  was  responsible  for\n53 the reduced  expression  of  miR-34s.  Because  the  frequency  of  methylation  was  higher  in miR-34b/c,  we\nfocused  on  miR-34b/c  for a  functional  analysis.  We  examined  the  effect  of  miR-34b/c  introduction  on\ncell  proliferation,  migration  and  invasion.  The  transfection  of  miR-34b/c  to two  SCLC cell  lines  (H1048\nand  SBC5)  resulted  in  the  significant  inhibition  of  cell  growth,  migration,  and  invasion,  compared  with\ncontrol  transfectants.  Our  results  indicate  that  the  aberrant  methylation  of  miR-34b/c  plays  an  important\nrole in  the  pathogenesis  of  SCLC,  implying  that  miR-34b/c  may  be  a useful  therapeutic  target  for  SCLC.\n. Introduction\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in\nhe world at present. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggres-\nive tumor with a dismal prognosis among primary lung cancers\nnd accounts for approximately 13% of all lung cancers [1,2].\nhemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is generally the treatment\nf choice for SCLC patients because the clinical features of SCLC\nnclude a high rate of metastasis to lymph nodes and distant organs\neginning at an early stage. A strong initial response but early\ncquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a unique feature\n\nf SCLC [3,4], resulting in a poor prognosis and a 5-year survival rate\nf only 5% [5].  Thus, the development of new therapeutic strategies\ns mandatory.\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author. Tel.: +81 86 235 7265; fax: +81 86 235 7269.\nE-mail address: toyooka@md.okayama-u.ac.jp (S.

For example, epider-\nmal  growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations [9],  K-ras mutations\nand P16 methylation [8] are frequently found in non-small cell lung\ncancer (NSCLC), but not in SCLC [10]. In contrast, TP53 mutations\n[8,11] or RASSF1A methylation [12] is frequently found in SCLC,\ncompared with NSCLC. These results indicate that the molecular\npathogenesis differs between SCLC and NSCLC.\n\nMany studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can act as\noncogenes or tumor suppressors and that the widespread alter-\nation of miRNA expression patterns is highly relevant to various\nhuman malignancies [13]. In lung cancer, the reduced expression\n\nof let-7 [14] or the overexpression of miR-155 [15] is reportedly\ncorrelated with the clinical outcome of NSCLC. Among the miRNAs,\nmiRNA-34 (miR-34) family members reportedly play important\ntumor-suppressive roles, as they are directly regulated by p53 and\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.10.002\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcan\nmailto:toyooka@md.okayama-u.ac.jp\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.10.002\n\n\ng Can\n\nc\ni\ng\nw\nm\no\na\nm\nt\ni\ne\no\na\ni\n\nf\np\ni\no\n\n2\n\n2\n\nN\nS\nt\nU\nw\nn\no\nr\nb\nr\nn\ni\nl\n\nH\n(\nN\nH\nN\nN\nH\nH\nc\n,\nU\nl\n(\nI\nw\ns\ni\nm\ni\nw\nw\nd\nt\nc\nd\nm\n\nN. Tanaka et al. / Lun\n\nompose the p53 network [16]. The members of the miR-34 fam-\nly consist of three miRNAs (miR-34a, 34b and 34c), the target\nenes of which are considered to be similar to one another but\nith some notable differences [17]. miR-34a is located on chro-\nosome 1q36.22, while miR-34b and 34c (miR-34b/c) are located\n\nn chromosome 11q23 and are generated by the processing of\n single transcript [17]. A previous study indicated that miR-34\nethylation was present in NSCLC and was significantly related\n\no an unfavorable clinical outcome [18]. In a functional analysis the\nntroduction of miR-34b/c into NSCLC suppressed the cell prolif-\nration of NSCLC [19]. However, these studies examining the roles\nf miRNA in lung cancer have been mainly performed for NSCLC,\nnd miRNA alterations and their impact on SCLC have not been\nnvestigated.\n\nIn this study, we investigated miR-34 methylation in SCLC and\nound that miR-34b/c was frequently methylated in SCLC, com-\nared with NSCLC. Subsequently, we investigated the biological\n\nmpact of miR-34b/c methylation on SCLC to understand the role\nf miR-34b/c in the tumorigenesis of SCLC.\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1. Clinical samples and cell lines\n\nA total of lung cancer specimens comprising 12 SCLC, 47\nSCLC resected tumors, and 15 malignant pleural effusions in\nCLC patients were retrieved from Okayama University Hospi-\nal, Okayama, Japan and NHO Yamaguchi-Ube Medical Center,\nbe, Yamaguchi, Japan. Each resected tumor was  not treated\nith preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Corresponding\non-malignant tissue (peripheral lung or bronchial epithelium)\nf resected tumors were also available. Fifteen malignant pleu-\nal effusions were obtained from 8 patients who were treated\ny chemotherapy or radiotherapy and 7 patients who  were not\neceived any treatment. All the specimens were frozen with liquid\nitrogen immediately after surgery and stored at \u221280 \u25e6C. Written\n\nnformed consents were obtained from all the patients at two  col-\nection sites.\n\nEleven SCLC cell lines [NCI-H1048 (H1048), SBC5, HCC33, NCI-\n211 (H211), NCI-H524 (H524), NCI-H841 (H841), NCI-H1688\n\nH1688), NCI-H1870 (H1870), NCI-H2141 (H2141), NCI-H82 (H82),\nCI-H249 (H249)] and 14 NSCLC cell lines [PC-9, HCC827, NCI-\n1975 (H1975), NCI-H3255 (H3255), A549, NCI-H1395 (H1395),\nCI-H522 (H522), NCI-H838 (H838), HCC15, NCI-H125 (H125),\nCI-H460 (H460), NCI-H661 (H661), NCI-H1299 (H1299), NCI-\n358 (H358)] were used in this study. We  also investigated the\nBEC 5KT cell, established from non-malignant human bronchial\nells. Cell lines whose prefix is NCI-H- (abbreviated as H-) or HCC-\n\n and HBEC 5KT were kindly provided by Dr. Adi F. Gazdar (The\nniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dal-\n\nas, TX). SBC5 was obtained from Drs. M.  Tanimoto and K. Kiura\nOkayama University, Okayama, Japan). PC-9 was obtained from\nmmuno-Biological Laboratories (Takasaki, Gunma, Japan). A549\n\nas obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manas-\nas, VA). All the cell lines except for HBEC 5KT were maintained\nn RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)  supple-\n\nented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37 \u25e6C\nn a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. HBEC 5KT cell line\n\nas maintained in Keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)\nith bovine pituitary extract (BPE) and human recombinant epi-\nermal growth factor (EGF). H82, H249, H1048, and SBC5 were\n\nreated with 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (DAC) (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) at a\noncentration of 5\u201310 \ufffdM for 6 days, with medium changes on\nays 1, 3, and 5, to restore gene expression that was reduced by\nethylation.\ncer 76 (2012) 32\u2013 38 33\n\n2.2. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) assay\n\nGenomic DNA was  extracted from cell lines and tissues by stan-\ndard phenol\u2013chloroform (1:1) extraction or by DNeasy Tissue Kit\n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA was  subjected to bisulfate treatment\nusing the EZ DNA Methylation Gold kit (Zymo Research Corp.,\nIrvine, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For malig-\nnant pleural effusions, genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp\nCirculating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen) and bisulfite conversion was\nperformed using Epitect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol. The methylation statuses of miR-34a and\n34b/c were determined by MSP  assay using specific primers for\nthe methylated and unmethylated forms [20]. The DNA from HBEC\n5KT was  treated with SssI methyltransferase (New England BioLabs,\nBeverly, MA)  and was used as a positive control for methylated alle-\nles. PCR products were analyzed in 2% agarose gels and stained with\nethidium bromide.\n\n2.3. miR-34s expression by quantitative RT-PCR\n\nThe miRNA was isolated from cell lines and tissue speci-\nmens with TaqMan MicroRNA Cells-to-CTTM Kit (Ambion, Austin,\nTX) and mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) and treated\nwith DNase I (Ambion) to remove genomic DNA. Reverse tran-\nscriptional (RT) reaction was  performed for extracted 0.5 \ufffdg\nmiRNA with TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcriptional Kit sys-\ntems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using TaqMan single\nRT primers for each miRNA (Applied Biosystems). The quantita-\ntive RT-PCR for miR-34a, 34b, and 34c using TaqMan MicroRNA\nAssays technology (Perkin Elmer Corp., Foster City, CA) with the\nStep One Plus Real Time PCR systems (Applied Biosystems). The\nmiR-374 expression was  used to normalize the expression of\nmiR-34s as endogenous control of cell lines following manu-\nfacturer\u2019s recommendation (www.appliedbiosystems.com). After\nnormalization of miR-34s expression to miR-374, all relative\nexpression values were defined as the ratios of the normalized\nmiR-34s expression value of cell lines or primary tumors to that\nof HBEC 5KT or individual non-malignant lung tissue, respec-\ntively.\n\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry for p53 expression\n\nAbnormality of p53 expression was examined using immuno-\nhistochemistry for primary tumors. To detect the p53 protein, we\nused a monoclonal antibody against human p53 (DAKO-p53, DAKO,\nDenmark). The routinely formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tis-\nsue blocks were sectioned at a 4 \ufffdm thickness. They were stained\nby hematoxylin and eosin stain to confirm the presence and\nintensity of tumor cells and processed for immunohistochemistry\n(IHC). Tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated\nwith graded ethanol, and immersed in Tris\u2013buffered saline for\nIHC. For p53 scoring, more than 10 randomly chosen high power\nfields were evaluated under an optical microscope and a trained\npathologist was defined blindly scored. In this study, p53 muta-\ntional status was  defined as positive when more than 15% of cells\nwere positive regardless of the intensity as previously reported\n[21,22].\n\n2.5. Plasmid construction and gene transfection\n\nThe miR-34b/c or scramble fragment as control was subcloned\ninto pSilencer 4.1-CMV neo Plasmid Vector (Ambion). Four \ufffdg of\n\npSilencer 4.1-CMV neo Vector was  introduced into SCLC cell lines\nusing LipofectamineTM 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). For experiments\nof transient transfection, cells were collected 72 h after the trans-\nfection.

Cell migration and invasion assays\n\nCell migration and invasion ability were established using a\noyden chamber assay with filter inserts (pore size, 8 \ufffdm)  in\n-well plates (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA).\nhe cells in 2 ml  serum-free RPMI1640 medium (300 \ufffdl contain-\nng 2.5 \u00d7 105 cells for transwell migration assay and 5 \u00d7 105 for\n\natrigel invasion assay) were added to the top chamber. The\nottom chamber was prepared with 10% FBS as a chemoattrac-\nant. Non-invasive cells were removed by scrubbing with a cotton\nwab after 24\u201348 and 48\u201396 h of incubation for migration assay\nnd invasion assay, respectively. The cells that had migrated\nhrough the membrane and stuck to the lower surface of the\n\nembrane were fixed and stained using Diff-Quik stain (Sysmex,\nobe, Japan). For quantification of migration and invasion, the cells\nere counted under a microscope in 5 predetermined fields at\n100 magnifications representing the average of 3 independent\nxperiments.\n\n.8. Western blot analysis\n\nCells were grown to 80% confluency and harvested in lysis\nuffer [20 mmol/L Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L\na2EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophos-\nhate, 1 mmol/L \ufffd-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 \ufffdg/ml\n\neupeptin] (Cell signaling Technology, Beverly, MA)  supplemented\nith Complete, Mini (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) to extract protein.\n\notal 30 \ufffdg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred\no PVDF membranes. The proteins on membranes were incubated\nvernight at 4 \u25e6C with the primary antibodies. We  selected two\nolecules (c-MET and CDK6). The primary antibodies for Western\n\nlotting are as follows: anti-MET (25H2, Cell Signaling), anti-\nhospho-MET (3D7, Tyr1234/1235; Cell Signaling), and anti-CDK6\nDCS83, Cell Signaling). The following secondary antibodies were\nsed: goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-conjugated horseradish\neroxidase (HRP) (Santa Cruz). To detect specific signals, the mem-\nranes were detected by ECL plus Western Blotting Detection\neagents (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited, Buckinghamshire,\nK).\n\n.9. Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Win-\nows version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). All of the in vitro\nxperiments were performed at least three times. Data were\nepresented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The significance of\n\nhe differences between two groups was determined using the\nhi-square test and the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, as appropriate.\n\n 5% significance level (p < 0.05) was considered statistically\nignificant.\nination with normal cells.

Methylation and expression status of miR-34s\n\nWe examined the methylation frequencies of miR-34a and b/c\nin 11 SCLC cell lines, 27 clinical samples consisting of 12 primary\ntumors and 15 malignant pleural effusions. Usefulness of malignant\npleural effusions to detect DNA methylation has been previously\nreported [23]. For comparison purposes, the methylation frequen-\ncies of miR-34a and b/c were also examined in 14 NSCLC cell\nlines and 47 primary tumors. Representative images of the elec-\ntrophoresis results are shown in Fig. 1. MSP  of the cell lines showed\nthree PCR band patterns: only a methylated band, both a methy-\nlated and an unmethylated band, and only a methylated band. The\npresence of both methylated and unmethylated bands indicated\npartial methylation. In this study, cell lines with partial methyla-\ntion were classified as methylated cell lines. The methylation of\nmiR-34a and miR-34b/c was  observed in 4 (36%) and 7 (64%) out of\n11 SCLC cell lines, respectively. Among the 27 SCLC clinical speci-\nmens, miR-34a and miR-34b/c were methylated in 4 (15%) and 18\n(67%), respectively. Stratified by specimens, miR-34a methylation\nwas  found in 3 of 12 SCLC tumors and 1 of 15 malignant pleural\neffusions and miR-34b/c methylation was found in 9 of 12 tumors\nand 9 of 15 malignant pleural effusions. There was no significant\ndifference in frequency of methylation between resected tumors\nand malignant pleural effusion specimens. In addition, no signifi-\ncant difference was found in the frequencies of miR-34 methylation\nbetween previously treated 8 pleural effusions (0% in miR-34a and\n\n75% in miR-34b/c) and 7 pleural effusions without any treatment\n(14% in miR-34a and 57% in miR-34b/c), respectively. Among the\nNSCLC tumors, miR-34a and miR-34b/c methylation were observed\n\n\n\nN.

The frequency of miR-34b/c methylation was\nignificantly higher among the SCLC primary tumors than among\nhe NSCLC samples (p < 0.001).\n\n.2. Relationship between methylation and expression in SCLC\n\nThe expressions of miR-34a, 34b, and 34c in 11 SCLC cell\nines and 6 available SCLC primary tumors (4 methylated and 2\nnmethylated cases) were examined using quantitative RT-PCR\nTables 1 and 2). The expression values of the miR-34s were defined\ns the ratio of the normalized expression value of SCLC cell lines\no that of HBEC 5KT and that of the primary SCLC tumors to that\nf individual non-malignant lung tissue with arbitrarily assigned\nalues of 1, respectively. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, all expression\nalues of miR-34s in SCLC cell lines and primary tumors were lower\nhan their normal control samples (HBEC 5KT and non-malignant\nung tissue). The expressions of the miR-34b and 34c were signifi-\nantly lower in the methylated cell lines than in the unmethylated\nell lines (miR-34b, p = 0.011; miR-34c, p = 0.008). Regarding miR-\n4a, no significant difference or tendency was detected (p = 0.107).\nhis finding may  reflect the small sample sizes or the presence of\nartially methylated cells. One cell line (H2141) with unmethylated\niR-34a had very low expression value (0.05) for miR-34a, suggest-\n\nng the presence of an alternative mechanism for gene silencing.\nWe  also treated 4 cell lines with DAC and found that the expres-\n\nions of the miR-34s were restored in the methylated SCLC cell lines\nut not in the unmethylated cell lines (Table 3).\n\n.3. p53 status in SCLC\n\np53 is a transcriptional factor for miR-34s. Thus, we examined\nhe correlation between the p53 status and the expressions of miR-\n4s (Table 2). Genotyping data for the TP53 gene in H1048, SBC5,\n211, H524, H841, H2141, H82, and H249 were queried from the\natabase of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\nersion 15 (www-p53.iarc.fr) to find that all cell lines harbor TP53\nutation. HCC33 and H1870 also harbor mutation (HCC33, C242Y\n\nnd H1870, Y234C) and these data were provided by Dr. Adi F. Gaz-\n\nar (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas,\nallas, TX, USA). The mutation status of H1688 was not available.\ns a result, 10 out of 11 cell lines were found to carry TP53 muta-\n\nions. The p53 status of the primary tumors was determined using\n-34b/c) or control (p-scramble) plasmid vectors. (A) Representative results of colony\nlony formation efficiencies are presented. Shown are means of three replications;\n\nimmunohistochemistry [21,22].  The aberrant positive expression\nof p53 protein was regarded as a p53 abnormality (mutation) in\nthe primary cancers. Four (67%) out of the 6 primary SCLC tumors\nexhibited positive p53 immunohistochemistry results suggesting\nthe presence of p53 mutation. The relationship between the p53\nalterations and the expressions of miR-34s was examined, but no\ncorrelation between the p53 status and the expressions of miR-34s\nwas  found.\n\n3.4. Impact of miR-34b/c on cell proliferation\n\nBecause the frequency of methylation was higher in miR-34b/c\nand because miR-34a methylation in SCLC cell lines was mainly\npartial methylation but miR-34b/c was heavily methylation, we\nfocused on miR-34b/c for a functional analysis. For this purpose, we\nestablished stable transfectants with miR-34b/c and scramble con-\ntrols for H1048 and SBC5. To examine the anti-proliferative effect\nof miR-34b/c induction, we  performed a colony formation assay\nfor stable transfectants. Cell proliferation was significantly inhib-\nited in the SCLC cells transfected with miR-34b/c, compared with\nthat in the cells that were transfected with a scramble control (50%\ninhibition for H1048, p = 0.001; 44% for SBC5, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2).\n\n3.5. Impact of miR-34b/c on cell migration and invasion\n\nTo estimate the effect of introducing miR-34b/c on the migration\nand invasion potential of SCLC, cell migration and invasion poten-\ntial were examined using a Boyden chamber. Microscopy images\nof the Boyden chamber assay are shown in Fig. 3. Migration and\ninvasion were significantly suppressed in miR-34b/c transfectants,\ncompared with control transfectants (migration: 50% inhibition for\nH1048, p = 0.051; 54% for SBC5, p = 0.044; invasion: 33% inhibition\nfor H1048, p = 0.002; 30% inhibition for SBC5, p = 0.012).\n\n3.6. Protein expression of stable transfectants\n\nTo examine the effect of miR-34b/c introduction, we focused\non c-MET (both total and phosphorylated types) and CDK6 which\nwere the putative target of miR-34b/c. Western blotting was  carried\n\nout in SCLC stable transfectants. Total and phosphorylated c-MET\nand CDK6 expressions were down-regulated in the SCLC cell lines\nexamined. CDK6 tended to be down-regulated by the miR-34b/c in\ncell lines whose native protein expression was present (Fig. 4).\n\nhttp://www-p53.iarc.fr/\n\n\n36 N.

Discussion\n\nIn this study, we found that miR-34b/c methylation was a fre-\nuent alteration of SCLC. As a result, miR-34b/c expression was\neduced in SCLC, causing tumor cell proliferation and invasive-\ness. Our results also indicated that miR-34b/c methylation is the\narly event for tumorigenesis of SCLC because there was  no differ-\nnce in frequency between surgically resected tumors supposed\no be early stage and malignant pleural effusions considered to\ne advanced stage. In addition to lung cancer, miR-34b/c methy-\n\nation has been reported in various kinds of malignant tumors\nncluding colorectal and ovarian cancers [20,24].  We  previously\neported the methylation and function of miR-34b/c in malignant\nleural mesothelioma [25]; the same established methodology was\nlso used in the present study. p53 is a transcriptional factor for\niR-34s. The p53 mutation has been reported in various cancers,\nncluding lung cancer. However, the effect of p53 mutation on the\nxpression and methylation of miR-34b/c remains uncertain. In\nvarian cancer, miR-34a methylation and p53 mutation are not\nssociated.

In addition, p53 mutation has no effect on miR-34b/c\nmethylation in ovarian cancer [24]. In the SCLC cell lines that were\nexamined in the present study, 10 out of 11 cell lines carried a\np53 mutation, but the expression levels of the miR-34s varied and\nwere correlated with the methylation status. In primary tumors,\nwhile the p53 mutational status was  determined using immuno-\nhistochemistry [21,22], the relationship among the expression and\nmethylation of miR-34b/c and p53 mutation was similar to that\nin the cell lines. Our data suggest that miR-34 expression was not\ncompletely silenced in the p53-altered cases and that methylation\nmay  contribute more strongly to the expressions of miR-34s.\n\nAntitumor effects, including the inhibition of cell proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion, were observed with the introduction of\nmiR-34b/c. In general, miRNA has multiple target mRNAs, and c-\nMet  is a well-known target molecule of miR-34b/c [16,17]. c-Met\n\nand its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have been shown to\nbe involved in cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis [26,27].\nA previous study found that the c-Met/HGF pathway was  func-\ntional in SCLC, indicating in vitro that the c-MET/HGF axis may\n\nFold change after DAC\n\nmiR-34a miR-34b miR-34c\n\n1.2 3.9 279.8\n3.8 1.9 20.5\n1.1 4.2 52.6\n1.8 2.8 2.2\n\n-34b/c expression in SCLC cell lines with methylation after 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine\nAC-treated cell lines compared with the miR-34s expression values in non-treated\n\n\n\nN.

Our results, together with\nhose of previous reports, strongly suggest that miR-34b/c plays\nn important role in the pathogenesis of SCLC and may  be a useful\nherapeutic target for SCLC.\n\nIn SCLC, the methylation of miR-34a was not a frequent event\nompared with that of miR-34b/c, but its expression was  low\nompared with that in non-malignant lung tissue. The degree of\n\neduction in miR-34a expression was similar to that of miR-34b/c\nn some SCLC cell lines, suggesting that miR-34a silencing may  also\ne involved in the pathogenesis of SCLC, although the mechanism\n\nig. 4.

The quantitative values expressed as the means \u00b1 SD of five microscopic\n\nof silencing has not been clearly elucidated. Further study on the\nrole of miR-34a in SCLC is warranted.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings showed that miR-34b/c is more\nfrequently methylated in SCLC than in NSCLC, resulting in the\ndown-regulation of miR-34b/c. As this alteration confers a growth\nand invasion advantage to cancer cells, targeting miR-34b/c is a\npotential therapeutic option for the treatment of SCLCs. The tar-\ngeting of SCLCs is of particular interest, as recent trials of targeted\ndrugs for lung cancer have focused mainly on NSCLCs.\n\nConflict of interest statement\n\nNone declared.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nWe  thank Adi F.
