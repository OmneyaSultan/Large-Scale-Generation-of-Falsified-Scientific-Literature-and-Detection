Yuan).\nThe regulator of cytokine signaling known as protein inhibitor of activated STAT-1 (PIAS1) is increasingly\nunderstood to have diverse regulatory functions for inflammation, but its effect in inflammatory condi-\ntions such as severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) has not previously been reported. The aim of this study was\nto investigate the effect of upregulation of PIAS1 on SAP associated with acute lung injury (ALI), and its\nsubsequent effect on disease severity. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were given an IV injection of adenovirus\nserotype 5 (Ad5)/F35-PIAS1, Ad5/F35-vector or saline before induction of SAP. The control group received\nonly a sham operation. Lung and pancreas samples were harvested 16 h after induction. The protein lev-\nels of PIAS1 in tissue were investigated. The severity of pancreatic injury was determined by a histological\nscore of pancreatic injury, serum amylase, and pancreatic water content. The lung injury was evaluated\nby measurement of pulmonary microvascular permeability, lung myeloperoxidase activity and malondi-\naldehyde levels. The survival rates of rats were also analyzed. The results found that in Ad5/F35-PIAS1\ntreated rats, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6 levels were decreased\nbut showed no influence on the levels of IL-10, and the severity of pancreatic tissue injury was less\ncompared with either untreated SAP or Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P < 0.01). The administration of\nAd5/F35-PIAS1 in SAP-induced rats downregulated the activity of the signal transducer and activator\nof transcription-1 (STAT1) pathway and the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and\nintercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 protein in lung. Thus, compared with the untreated SAP rats,\nthe inflammatory response and the severity of ALI decreased, and the survival rates increased\n(P < 0.01). These findings suggest that PIAS1 could augment anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting\nSTAT1, thus attenuating the severity of SAP associated with ALI.\n\n\ufffd 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It carries an\noverall mortality rate of 10\u201315% [1], but the rate approaches 30\u2013\n40% for especially severe cases [2]. Deaths associated with severe\nacute pancreatitis (SAP) are mainly due to its major complication,\nthe development of multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (for-\nmerly known as multiple organ failure). Acute lung injury (ALI) is\na major component of this complication, clinically manifested as\nacute respiratory distress syndrome [3]. Despite significant ad-\nvances in understanding the pathogenesis of ALI in SAP and its\nmanagement, the mortality rate remains unacceptably high.\n\nStudies have shown that pancreatic damage due to SAP leads to\nthe release of systemic inflammatory cytokines, including tumor\nll rights reserved.\n\n. Chen), sap19760714@sina.\nn), yuanyz28@yahoo.com.cn\nnecrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-1b. These cytokines\nmay result in distant organ damage and the development of ALI.\nThey therefore play a key role in the pathogenesis of SAP with\nALI, and are ultimately responsible for the majority of deaths asso-\nciated with this condition [4]. Related studies found that the tran-\nscriptional induction of genes involved in the release of\ninflammatory cytokines associated with SAP is controlled by vari-\nous regulated factors, including the Janus kinase/signal transducer\nand activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway [5].\n\nA family of negative regulators of the JAK/STAT signaling path-\nway is that of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS), with\nfour members: PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASx, and PIASy. Gene activation\nanalyzes show that PIAS1 selectively regulates a subset of STAT1-\ndependent genes, with a notable preference for inflammatory\nresponse [6]. Related studies found that PIAS1-null mice demon-\nstrated a hypersensitivity to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic\nshock, and others indicate that PIAS1 is involved into in response\nto inflammatory stimuli, such as TNF-a and lipopolysaccharide [7].\n\nPIAS1 participates in anti-inflammatory responses by regulating\nthe transcription factor, nuclear factor-j-light-chain-enhancer of\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.02.016\nmailto:chenping714@yahoo.com.cn\nmailto:sap19760714@sina. com\nmailto:sap19760714@sina. com\nmailto:chenping714@medmail.com.cn\nmailto:yuanyz28@yahoo.com.cn\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.02.016\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n306 P. Chen et al. / Cytokine 54 (2011) 305\u2013314\nactivated B cells. This transcription factor is involved in the induc-\ntion of approximately 200 genes, many of which are involved in\ninflammatory responses [8\u201310]. In addition, PIAS1 has also been\nsuggested to promote the sumoylation of the transcription factor\nperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c, resulting in the\ntrans-repression of inflammatory gene activation [11]. These find-\nings support a hypothesis that a focus on the regulation of PIAS1\nmight be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflam-\nmatory disorders. However, past studies have not fully addressed\nwhether the administration of PIAS1 would prove equally effica-\ncious if administered upon the onset of SAP. As well, the precise\nmechanisms determining the effect of PIAS1 on SAP relative to\nthe degree of lung injury are largely unknown.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to elucidate the up-regulating ef-\nfect of PIAS1 on SAP associated with ALI. We performed a series of\nstudies to explore for a new therapeutic agent for SAP, including\ntotal water content, scoring of lung injury, neutrophil count in\nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung tissue myeloperoxidase\n(MPO) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and inflammatory\nmediators levels, and a survival analysis of rats with SAP.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Animals and reagents\n\nThe male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats, 150\u2013200 g, obtained from the\nanimal experimental department of Ruijin Hospital were randomly\ndivided into the following groups.\n\nIn the SAP group (n = 20), 24 h prior to the start of the experi-\nments the rats were deprived of food but allowed access to water.\nThe rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pento-\nbarbital (30%, 0.15 mL/100 g). SAP was induced by retrograde infu-\nsion of 3.5% sodium taurocholate (1.5 mL/kg, Sigma\u2013Aldrich,\nSt. Louis, MO, USA) into the pancreatic duct transduodenally for\n2\u20133 min via a 24-gauge angiocath using a constant infusion rate\nof 100 lL/min under laparotomy. The abdominal wounds were\nclosed and the rats returned to their cages with free access to water\nand food after surgery.\n\nIn treated groups, we used replication-defective adenovirus sero-\ntype 5/F35 (Ad5/F35) as the vector. Ad5/F35-PIAS1 was constructed\nby Benyuanzhengyang Bio. (Shanghai, China) using the previously\ndescribed method [12]. PIAS1 cDNA, containing the full-length\ntranslated regions, were sub-cloned into the PDC316-MCMV-EGFP\ntransfer plasmid. This plasmid was cotransfected into 293 cells,\nalong with a fragment of the plasmid containing the Ad5/F35 aden-\noviral vector. Additionally, an Ad5/F35 containing an empty expres-\nsion cassette was constructed for use as a control (Ad5/F35-vector).\nAll of the viral constructs were similar with the exception of the\ntransgene, and the production and purification procedures were\nidentical. The dosage of Ad5/F35 delivery to these animals was based\non our previous studies\u2019 results (Un-published data). Ad5/F35-PIAS1\nor Ad5/F35-vector (3.6 \ufffd 108 PFU/100 g in 25 lL sterile PBS) was\ndelivered by IV injection through the penile vein in rats at 10 min,\non day 1, or on day 2 prior to SAP induction (n = 10, 10 and 10, respec-\ntively for each treatment). For these treatment groups, SAP was in-\nduced with 3.5% sodium taurocholate as described above. Based on\nthe results of PIAS1 protein expression levels, on day 2 before SAP\ninduction, rats who had received the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 or Ad5/F35-\nvector treatment were selected for future study.\n\nIn the control group (n = 10), rats were given only a sham oper-\nation, consisting of administration of an equal volume of PBS (with\nno SAP induction, Ad5/F35-PIAS1 or Ad5/F35-vector treatment).\n\nBlood samples, pancreatic and lung tissues were harvested at\n16 h after the onset of induction according to our previous\nmethods [13]. The serum was separated from blood by a 1600g,\n10 min centrifugation for examination. The experiments were\nconducted according to the Guidelines of the Shanghai Animal\nUse and Care Committee and the National Animal Welfare Law.\n\n2.2. Morphological examination\n\nPancreatic and lung tissue samples were fixed in 4% formalde-\nhyde overnight and subsequently dehydrated through a graded\nethanol series. After impregnation in paraffin wax, tissue samples\nwere cut into blocks (4 lm). Pancreatic and lung tissues were\nstained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H&E) and examined by light\nmicroscopy. Sections were examined by an experienced morphol-\nogist, who was blinded to the sample identity, for tissue injury.\nFor this study, five randomly chosen microscopic fields were exam-\nined for each tissue sample and given a histological score for injury\naccording to the previously described method [14,15].\n\n2.3. Wet/dry weight ratio of pancreatic or lung tissue\n\nPancreatic or lung tissue edema was evaluated by tissue water\ncontent. A portion of the pancreatic or lung tissue was taken imme-\ndiately after sacrifice, to trim fat and weigh. Tissue water content\nwas determined by calculating the wet weight/dry weight ratio\naccording to the formula: [(wet weight \ufffd dry weight)/dry\nweight] \ufffd 100%, where the wet weight was the initial weight of\nthe respective tissue and the weight after incubation at 72 \ufffdC for\n24 h was the dry weight.\n\n2.4. Biochemical assays\n\nSerum amylase level was determined by a Beckman CX7 Chem-\nistry Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Serum TNF-a,\nIL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA kit, Mai Bio, Shanghai, China).\n\n2.5. Lung tissue MPO and MDA assays\n\nTo carry out the assays, 1 g lung tissue samples were thawed,\nhomogenized in 1 M PBS (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 12,000g for\n10 min at 4 \ufffdC. The supernatant was assayed for MPO activity\nand MDA concentration with test kits (Jianchen Bio, Nanjing,\nChina). All procedures were done in accordance with the manufac-\nturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n2.6. Neutrophil counting in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)\n\nRats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital, and a\nmedian sternotomy allowed for exposure of both lungs. The trachea\nwas exposed and inserted with an IV infusion needle. After ligating\nthe hilum of the right lung, the left lung was lavaged five times with\n1 mL ice-cold PBS. The recovery ratio of the fluid was about 90%. The\nBALF was then centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min to separate cells\nfrom the supernatant. Cells were suspended in saline and the num-\nber of neutrophils was counted with a hemocytometer.\n\n2.7. Western blot assay\n\nTissue samples were washed twice with PBS, homogenized with\na tissue homogenizer in RIPA buffer (Biyuntian Shanghai, China),\nand centrifuged at 12,000g at 4 \ufffdC for 10 min. The supernatants\nwere collected and stored at \ufffd80 \ufffdC. Protein concentration of each\nsample was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay\n(Biyuntian, Shanghai, China). Each sample was adjusted up to the\ndesired protein content of 40 lg, denatured in loading buffer\n(62 mM Tris, 10% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),\n0.003% bromophenol blue) and separated by electrophoresis on a\n\n\n\nP.

The separated\nproteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane\nby using transfer buffer (39 mM glycine, 48 mM Tris pH 8.3, 20%\nmethanol) at 200 mA for 90 min. The membranes were blocked\nwith 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-0.1% Tween\nfor 1 h at room temperature, washed three times for 10 min in TBS-\n0.1% Tween. They were then incubated with a primary antibody,\neither STAT1, phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1; Cell Signaling\nBiotechnology, Danvers, MA, USA, diluted to 1:1000), PIAS1, intra-\ncellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, or matrix metalloproteinase-\n9 (MMP-9; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA, di-\nluted to 1:500), each in TBS-0.1% Tween, overnight at 4 \ufffdC. After\nbeing washed 3 \ufffd for 10 min in TBS-0.1% Tween, the membranes\nwere incubated with a second antibody: peroxidase-conjugated\ngoat anti-rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-goat IgG or rabbit anti-mouse\nFig. 1.

Survival studies\n\nAdditional groups of 10 rats each were treated as described\nabove, and were included in survival studies. The rats were al-\nlowed free access to food and water, and the survival time was re-\ncorded for 48 h.\n\n2.10. Statistical analysis\n\nAll data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD).\nStatistics were done using Statistical Package for the Social Sci-\nences (SPSS) software, version 10.5. The one-way analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA) with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison tests was\nused for comparisons. The survival curve was estimated using\nthe Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare\nsurvival time in each group. The life table method was used to\nevaluate the survival rate. A P-value <0.05 was considered statisti-\ncally significant.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Expression of PIAS1 protein\n\nOn the Western blot, PIAS1 protein was very weakly distin-\nguishable in lung and pancreas between the untreated SAP and\nAd5/F35-vector treated rats. However, treatment with Ad5/F35-\nPIAS1 resulted in a much greater increase in the PIAS1 protein\nexpression level in lung and pancreas, and more so when the treat-\nment was administered on day 2 than at either 10 min or 1 day be-\nfore SAP induction (Fig. 1A).

Chen et al. / Cytokine 54 (2011) 305\u2013314\ninvestigated by immunohistochemical staining in lung and pancre-\natic tissue of all rats. The results showed that in the Ad5/F35-PIAS1\ntreated rats, there was remarkable positive staining for PIAS1 in\nendothelial cells of lung and pancreatic acinar cells. However,\nPIAS1 was weakly expressed in control rats, and there was no\nremarkable PIAS1 staining in either the untreated SAP or Ad5/\nF35-vector treated rats (Fig. 1B and C).\n3.2. Histological changes of pancreatic and lung tissue\n\nLung tissue from control rats showed a normal structure and no\nhistopathological changes under a light microscope. In untreated\nSAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats, the lung tissue stained with\nH&E indicated a widespread increase in alveolar wall thickness\ncaused by edema, severe hemorrhage in the alveolus, alveolus col-\nlapse and obvious inflammatory cell infiltration. In the Ad5/F35-\nPIAS1 treated rats, the histopathological changes of lung tissue\nwere minor compared with those in the untreated SAP and Ad5/\nF35-vector treated rats, especially for hemorrhage in the alveolus\n(Fig. 2A). The infiltration of neutropils and mononuclear cells,\ninterstitial edema and focal necrotic areas were seen in the pancre-\natic tissue of both untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats.\nThe morphological changes in pancreatic tissue of Ad5/F35-PIAS1\ntreated rats included intralobular edema, inflammatory infiltrate,\nand acinar cell necrosis, but these were greatly reduced (character-\nized only by slightly interstitial edema), and without obvious\nparenchyma necrosis and hemorrhage. There were no observable\npancreatitis pathologic changes in control rats (Fig. 2B).\n\nThe severity of pancreatic injury in rats based on histological\nscore of pancreatic injury, the ratio of wet /dry weight of pancreatic\ntissue and serum amylase levels, are summarized in Table 1. The\nresults showed that the levels of these markers for inflammation\nwere significantly lower in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats as com-\npared to those of the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated\nrats (P < 0.01). However, the histological score of pancreatic injury\nand serum amylase levels in the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats were\nhigher than for the control rats (P < 0.01). The levels of the\nabove-mentioned markers showed no statistically significant dif-\nference between the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated\nrats (P > 0.05).\n\nThe tests for levels of severity of lung injury in rats, including\nthe histological score of lung injury and the ratio of wet/dry weight\nof lung tissue, are summarized in Table 2. Compared to the control\nrats, the histological score of lung injury and ratio of wet/dry\nweight of lung were significantly increased in both the untreated\nSAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P < 0.01). The increase in his-\ntological score of lung injury and ratio of wet/dry weight of lung\nwas significantly reduced in the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats\n(P < 0.01) compared to either untreated SAP or Ad5/F35-vector\ntreated rats, although still higher than in the control rats\n(P < 0.01). The levels of the above-mentioned markers showed no\nstatistical difference between the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-\nvector treated rats (P > 0.05).\n3.3. Detection of inflammatory response of lung\n\nThe MPO activity and concentrations of MDA in the lung were\nincreased in the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats\ncompared to that of the controls rats (P < 0.01, respectively), but\nthere was no significant different between the SAP and Ad5/F35-\n\n\n\nFig. 3.

However, in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated\nrats, the upregulation of PIAS1 protein markedly decreased the\nMPO activity and MDA concentration (vs. the untreated SAP and\nAd5/F35-vector treated rats, P < 0.01; vs. the control rats, P > 0.05,\nrespectively). The number of neutrophils in BALF showed increases\nin rats who received the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treat-\nment, as compared with that seen in the lungs of Ad5/F35-PIAS1\ntreated and control rats (P < 0.01). There were no significant differ-\nence between the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats\n(P > 0.05) (Table 3).\n3.4. Comparison of serum TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10 levels\n\nThe TNF-a, IL-1band IL-6 serum levels were significantly de-\ncreased in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats in comparison with those\nof SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats (P < 0.01), and there was\nno difference between the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated and control rats\n(P > 0.05). In addition, the serum levels of TNF-a, IL-1band IL-6\nshowed no significant difference between the untreated SAP and\nAd5/F35-vector treated rats (P > 0.05). Anti-inflammatory cytokine\nIL-10 levels were greatly deceased in untreated SAP rats compared\nto control rats (P < 0.01), and were also lower in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 or\nAd5/F35-vector treated rats than control rats (P < 0.01, respec-\ntively). There was no difference in IL-10 levels in Ad5/F35-PIAS1\nor Ad5/F35-vector treated rats compared to that of untreated SAP\nrats (P > 0.05) (Table 4).\n3.5. Pulmonary expression of inflammatory-regulated mediators\n\nWestern blot analysis of inflammatory-regulated mediators is\nshown in Fig. 3. To gain direct evidence for the mechanism leading\nto the reduction of the inflammatory response of lung induced by\nPIAS1 in rat with SAP, we determined the levels of un-phosphory-\nlated and phosphorylated STAT1 protein in lung tissue. The phos-\nphorylation of STAT1 protein (as assayed with P-STAT 1\nantibody) in the lungs of untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector trea-\nted rats was enhanced compared to that of control rats (P < 0.01).\nIn contrast, the treatment of SAP rats with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 led to\nthe abrogation of phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein (P < 0.01,\ncompared to untreated SAP and Ad/F35-vector treated rats), there\n\n\n\nFig. 4.

Chen et al. / Cytokine 54 (2011) 305\u2013314\nwas no difference in this regard when compared with the control\nrats (P > 0.05). However, the un-P-STAT1 protein levels (as assayed\nwith STAT 1 antibody) for all SAP-induced rats were higher\ncompared to that of control rats (P < 0.01). ICAM-1 protein expres-\nsion in the lung revealed that its 85-kDa protein expression levels\nwere increased in the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated\nrats, compared with either the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated or control\nrats (P < 0.01). Moreover, the increase of MMP-9 protein expression\nin lung was much more marked in the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-\nvector treated rats compared to that of the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated\nand control rats (P < 0.01). The levels of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 pro-\nteins showed no difference between either the Ad5/F35-PIAS1\ntreated and control rats or between the Ad5/F35-vector treated\nand untreated SAP rats (P > 0.05).\n3.6. Survival study\n\nThe average survival time of SAP-induced rats receiving Ad5/\nF35-PIAS1 was 31.70 \u00b1 5.16 h (95% confidence interval (CI):\n21.47\u201341.82). The average survival time of SAP-induced rats\nreceiving Ad5/F35-vector was 19.80 \u00b1 4.17 h (95% CI: 11.62\u2013\n27.97). As for the untreated SAP rats, the average survival time\nwas 18.70 \u00b1 4.19 h (95% CI: 10.48\u201326.91). The 48 h survival rate\nwas significantly improved in SAP rats with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treat-\nment compared with the untreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector\ntreated rats (P < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was\nseen in the survival rate between the untreated SAP and Ad5/\nF35-vector treated rats (Fig. 4).\n4. Discussion\n\nThe use of Ad5-based gene therapy offers several significant\nadvantages over the administration of recombinant proteins. For\nexample, the pretreatment of mice with Ad5 delivery-IL-10 re-\nduced weight loss, attenuated the release of inflammatory cyto-\nkines, and reduced mortality in mice with sepsis; pretreatment\nwith a control Ad5 delivery did not significantly exacerbate the\ninflammatory response. The results suggest that the injection of\nAd5 delivery-IL-10 could reduce the severity of sepsis in rats\n[16]. Therefore, the gene transfer has been proposed as a novel\nmethod to produce cytokine inhibitors or antagonists in inflamma-\ntion, in the present study the delivery of adenovirus-based gene\nwas used for the severe inflammatory disease SAP to explore its ef-\nfect of action.\n\nExpression with Ad5 vectors is rapid, with appearance of the\nprotein usually occurring within hours; peak expression occurs\nwithin 1\u20133 days after Ad5 instillation [16]. Some studies were per-\nformed in which the Ad5-delivered gene therapy was administered\nbefore the onset of the inflammatory state [17,18]. Recently, a hy-\nbrid Ad5 vector was developed, in which the fiber protein from\nAd35 was substituted for the original fiber. This vector binds in a\nCoxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor (CAR)-independent man-\nner, and has successfully been used to infect suspension cells. And\nthe ability of Ad5/F35 to deliver transgenes to cells with high\nefficiency and low toxicity provides an improved means of study-\ning the consequences of transient gene expression in cells [19].\n\nThis study explored the effect of using Ad5/F35-based gene\ntherapy to deliver PIAS1 in SAP-induced rats. Firstly, the time to\nadministrate Ad5/F35-PIAS1 seems to be very important, since it\ntakes time to transfect and express protein. The route and time\ncourse of Ad5/F35 delivery to these animals was based on previous\nstudies that have also been shown that cytokine production after\nthe administration of Ad5-cytokine gene persists for 4 days [20].\nAccording to the results of PIAS1 protein expression, the current\nstudy demonstrates that Ad5/F35 transfer of PIAS1 is an effective\nmethod to transfect the pancreas and lung for up to 3 days in rats\nwhen delivered by IV injection. The expression of PIAS1 protein in\nlung and pancreatic tissue was greatly increased in rats who were\ntreated with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 on day 2 before SAP induction com-\npared to those treated 10 min or 1 day prior to SAP induction.\nTherefore, the rats received with Ad5/F35-PIAS1 on day 2 before\nSAP induction was used for future investigation. And these findings\nrepresent the first demonstration of prophylactic strategy of Ad5/\nF35 gene transfer in experimental SAP. Secondly, the early inter-\nvention is necessary in the treatment of SAP, since SAP develops\nfast and the consequent systemic responses will increase mortality,\nthus making therapies more difficult and more costly. Here, we\npresented the first evidence that early prophylactic administration\nof Ad5F35-PIAS1 could ameliorate the extent of injury of pancre-\natic tissue in SAP-induced rats and decrease mortality. Thirdly,\nthe administration of the Ad5F35-vector had no effect on the injury\n\n\n\nP. Chen et al. / Cytokine 54 (2011) 305\u2013314 313\nextent of pancreatic tissue in SAP-induced rats. Finally, because of\nthe results mentioned above, it was necessary to further evaluate\nthe effective mechanisms of up-regulation of PIAS1 on SAP-in-\nduced rats associated with ALI.\n\nALI is an important problem affecting the severity of SAP [21]. It\nis believed that the excess production of inflammatory mediators\nreleased by macrophages, neutrophils and other cells of the im-\nmune system in a cascade network is the underlying mechanism\ncausing ALI in SAP [22,23]. As SAP progresses, neutrophils are also\ntransmigrated across endothelial surfaces and into the tissues by\ninflammatory mediator induction, where they exert their toxic ef-\nfects, resulting in microvascular dysfunction and local inflamma-\ntory response. These responses include microvascular disorder,\nalveolar capillary barrier leakage, interstitial and alveolar edema,\nand eventual cell death [24,25].\n\nThe wet weigh/dry weight ratios of lung tissue for each group\nwere measured for assessment of changes in lung vascular perme-\nability. This study found that the Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats\nshowed a much lower ratio of wet to dry weight in lungs than in\nthe untreated SAP rats. Furthermore, when compared to the un-\ntreated SAP and Ad5/F35-vector treated rats, the Ad5/F35-PIAS1\ntreated rats had lower scores for lung injury, including measure-\nments of alveolar congestion, hemorrhage, infiltration or aggrega-\ntion of neutrophils in airspace or vessel wall, and thickness of the\nalveolar wall. According to the MPO assay measurement of neutro-\nphil accumulation, and the BALF count of neutrophils, the un-\ntreated SAP rats had a higher neutrophil accumulation than\neither the control or Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats. MDA is one of\nthe final products of lipid peroxidation, and its concentration is di-\nrectly proportional to the cell damage caused by reactive oxygen\nmetabolites [26]. In the present study, the increase in pulmonary\nMDA production following SAP induction was reduced by Ad5/\nF35-PIAS1 prophylactic administration, suggesting that Ad5/F35-\nPIAS1 is involved in an anti-inflammatory effect. These results lend\nsupport to the use of Ad5/F35-PIAS1 as an anti-inflammatory ther-\napy for SAP associated with ALI.\n\nThe STAT1 signaling pathway, one of the most important intra-\ncellular signaling pathways in mammals, is involved in the regula-\ntion of the inflammatory response. Various forms of stimuli can\nactivate it and thereafter the phosphorylation of STAT1 regulates\na variety of downstream proteins. Many studies have shown that\nSTAT1 regulates the transcription of cytokine genes [27]. Our\nprevious studies found that there was a positive interaction be-\ntween the activity of STAT1, which regulates the expression of\ninflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6, and the\nseverity of SAP. The inhibitor of STAT1 (Rapamycin) decreased\nthe levels of these inflammatory cytokines, thus lessening the\nseverity of SAP (Un-published data).\n\nMeanwhile, TNF-a and IL-1b are important inflammatory cyto-\nkines participating in the pathogenesis of SAP, directly injuring\ncells and causing necrosis, inflammation and edema [28]. IL-6 is\na multifunctional cytokine released by macrophages and is an\naccurate early predictor of acute pancreatitis severity, with a sen-\nsitivity range of 89\u2013100% [29]. The current study found that the\nearly administration of Ad5/F35-PIAS1 might block the induction\nof TNF-a and IL-1b. Previous study has also shown that IL-10 is\nan important anti-inflammatory cytokine and plays a role as a\nself-defense mechanism, limiting the intensity of the inflammatory\nprocess. Several studies concluded that IL-10 plays an important\nprotective role for pancreatic cell injury in SAP [30], but Ad5/\nF35-PIAS1 gene prophylactic administration had no significant\ninfluence on the release of IL-10 in the course SAP in this study.\n\nAs secondary chemotactic factors of inflammatory-regulated\nmediators, ICAM-1 and MMP-9 initiate a cascade reaction, accumu-\nlate neutrophilic leukocytes and stimulate the production of reac-\ntive oxygen species and other pro-inflammatory factors, attack\nand degrade membranes, damage membrane stability and causes\nlung vascular permeability [31\u201333]. In our experiments, the ele-\nvated levels of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 were found in SAP. The Ad5/\nF35-vector were administered IV have no significantly promotion\nin lung inflammation were observed in this study. Furthermore,\nthe pretreatment of Ad5/F35-PIAS1 was able to inhibit the activa-\ntion of STAT1, down-regulated the levels of downstream inflamma-\ntory-regulated mediators including ICAM-1 and MMP-9. As these\nmediators are known mediators of inflammatory injury, the reduc-\ntion in their levels may be important in attenuating the endothelial\npermeability of lung tissue and lessening the severity of ALI of SAP.\nThese findings suggest that pretreatment with Ad5/F35-based gene\ntherapy expressing PIAS1 can be safely performed during acute\ninflammation and can reduce the magnitude of the subsequent\ninflammatory process. As a final result, the survival time was pro-\nlonged in Ad5/F35-PIAS1 treated rats compared with SAP rats.\n\nIn our study, the results suggest that the prophylactic adminis-\ntration of PIAS1 inhibited the activation of STAT1 and down-\nregulated downstream inflammatory cytokines, relieved endothe-\nlial permeability, attenuated ALI and increased the survival rate\nin SAP-induced rats. PIAS1 also inhibited the inflammation and\nlessened the pancreatic injury of SAP. It might be helpful to use\nPIAS1 in SAP as a therapeutic strategy for the future experiment\nand we believe this study will be particularly relevant to clinical\nsettings.\nReferences\n\n[1] Yousaf M, McCallion K, Diamond T.
