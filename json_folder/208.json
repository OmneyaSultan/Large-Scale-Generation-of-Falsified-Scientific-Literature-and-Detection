Here we describe the identification\nof Rab1 as a conserved regulator of AA signaling to mTORC1. AA stimulates Rab1A GTP binding and\ninteraction with mTORC1 and Rheb-mTORC1 interaction in the Golgi. Rab1A overexpression promotes\nmTORC1 signaling and oncogenic growth in an AA- and mTORC1-dependent manner. Conversely, Rab1A\nknockdown selectively attenuates oncogenic growth of Rab1-overexpressing cancer cells. Moreover,\nRab1A is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), which is correlated with elevated mTORC1 signaling,\ntumor invasion, progression, and poor prognosis. Our results demonstrate that Rab1 is anmTORC1 activator\nand an oncogene and that hyperactive AA signaling through Rab1A overexpression drives oncogenesis\nand renders cancer cells prone to mTORC1-targeted therapy.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCell growth is a process of assimilating extracellular nutrients\n\ninto the cell mass, which requires the coordinated regulation of\n\nnutrient transport and protein synthetic capability. Signaling\n\nmodules have evolved to transduce nutrient cues to cellular pro-\n\ngrams such as transcription and translation (Dechant and Peter,\n\n2008; Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004; Zaman et al., 2008). mTOR is a\n\nconserved central growth controller in eukaryotes (Loewith and\n\nHall, 2011; Sengupta et al., 2010). It forms two distinct kinase\n\ncomplexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Loewith et al., 2002;\n\nSarbassov et al., 2004). In response to nutrient signals, mTORC1\nSignificance\n\nAA is an essential nutrient and key chemical signal for cell gro\nGTPase previously known for vesicular trafficking, has a cruc\nmTORC1 by AA and elucidates a Golgi-based mechanism by\nfurther demonstrates that aberrant hyperactivation of AA sig\ndriving oncogenic transformation and malignant growth.

Because mTORC1 is\n\ncommonly hyperactivated in human tumors, it is a desirable\n\ntarget for cancer therapy (Bjornsti and Houghton, 2004; Zhang\n\net al., 2011). Two rapamycin analogs (rapalogs), everolimus\n\nand temsirolimus, are Food and Drug Administration-approved\n\ndrugs for advanced renal and breast carcinomas. However,\n\nthe overall objective response rate remains low for rapalogs.\n\nTherefore, studying the regulation of mTORC1 is of considerable\n\nbiological and clinical importance.\nwth and metabolism. This study shows that Rab1A, a small\nial role in the Rag- and lysosome-independent activation of\nwhich Rab1A engages mTORC1 interaction with Rheb.

Rag proteins are lysosomal/vacu-\n\nolar membrane-bound small GTPases. Upon AA stimulation,\n\nRag GTPases function as heterodimers that bind to and activate\n\nTORC1 (Kim et al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008). In the presence of\n\nleucine, leucyl tRNA synthetase binds to Rags and promotes\n\nTORC1 signaling (Han et al., 2012). Rag is well conserved from\n\nyeast to humans (Sekiguchi et al., 2001). The yeast Rag homo-\n\nlogs Gtr1 and Gtr2 have been shown recently to also mediate\n\nAA signaling to TORC1 (Binda et al., 2009; Bonfils et al., 2012).\n\nBecause the importance of AA in cell growth and metabolism,\n\nhowever, Rag proteins are probably not the only sensors. The\n\ngoal of this study is to identify the Rag-independent regulator\n\nof AA signaling and investigate the underlying mechanism and\n\nsignificance.\n\nRESULTS\n\nYpt1 Is Essential for AA to Activate TORC1 in Yeast\nGtr1 and Gtr2, the yeast orthologs of RagA/RagB and RagC/\n\nRagD, respectively, function as a heterodimer to regulate\n\nTORC1 (Binda et al., 2009; Bonfils et al., 2012). Consistently,\n\ngtr1D and gtr2D mutants are hypersensitive to rapamycin (Fig-\n\nure 1A), indicative of their role in TORC1 signaling (Bertram\n\net al., 1998). However, thesemutants exhibit no apparent growth\n\ndefect, and AA can still fully activate TORC1 in gtr1D and gtr2D\n\nmutants, as judged by phosphorylation of the TORC1 substrates\n\nSch9 and Maf1 (Figure 1B) (Wei and Zheng, 2009; Wei and\n\nZheng, 2010). Additionally, the dominant-active Gtr1-guanosine\n\ntriphosphate (GTP) and Gtr2-guanosine diphosphate (GDP) do\n\nnot affect TORC1 activity during AA starvation and restimulation\n\n(Figure 1C). The yeast vacuole (lysosome) anchors Gtr1 and\n\nGtr2 signaling (Binda et al., 2009; Bonfils et al., 2012), but the\n\ngrowth and TORC1 signaling remain normal in vacuolar biogen-\n\nesis mutants vps16D, vps33D, pep3D, and pep5D (Figures 1A\n\nand 1D). Together, these observations clearly show that GTR\n\nand the vacuole are dispensable for AA signaling to TORC1 in\n\nyeast.\n\nWe showed previously that genes in the TORC1 pathway\n\ndisplay the rapamycin-sensitive phenotype (Bertram et al.,\n\n1998). Using this assay, we carried out a genomic screen and\n\nidentified a large set of TORC1 signaling genes (Chan et al.,\n\n2000). Because most known mTORC1 activators are small\n\nGTPases (e.g., Rheb, Rag, and Rho1) (Inoki et al., 2003; Kim\n\net al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008; Stocker et al., 2003; Tee et al.,\n\n2003; Yan et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2003), we focused our search\n\nfor the Rag-independent TORC1 activator on small GTPases,\n\nparticularly Rab, one of the largest small GTPase subfamilies\n\n(Hutagalung and Novick, 2011; Stenmark, 2009). Among the\n\nnine nonessential yeast Rab mutants, ypt6D and ypt7D are\n\nhypersensitive to rapamycin (Figure 1E). With the two essential\n\nRab genes, when assayed under Tet-off conditions (Hughes\n\net al., 2000), the Tet-YPT1 strain, but not the Tet-SEC4 strain,\n\nshowed a rapamycin-hypersensitive phenotype (Figure 1F). The\n\nypt1-ts mutant also displayed rapamycin hypersensitivity (Fig-\n\nure 1G). Therefore, Ypt1, Ypt6, and Ypt7 are involved in TORC1\n\nsignaling. However, depletion of YPT1 (Figure 1H), but not YPT6\n\nand YPT7, blocks the activation of TORC1 by AA (Figures 1H\n\nand 1I), indicating that Ypt1 is essential for AA signaling. The pre-\nCan\ncise role of Ypt6 and Ypt7 in TORC1 signaling is presently\n\nunknown.\n\nYpt1 is the yeast paralog of Rab1, a highly conserved Golgi\n\nmembrane-bound GTPase previously known for ER-to-Golgi\n\nvesicular trafficking (Hutagalung and Novick, 2011; Stenmark,\n\n2009). However, a large number of yeast mutants in ER-Golgi\n\ntrafficking do not display a rapamycin-sensitive phenotype\n\n(Figure S1A available online), suggesting that the role of\n\nRab1 in TORC1 signaling is not directly related to its trafficking\n\nfunction. Consistently, Ypt1 interacts with Tor1, which is a\n\nTORC1-specific component in yeast, in a GTP- and AA-\n\ndependent manner (Figure S1B), and AA stimulates GTP-bind-\n\ning by Ypt1 (Figures S1C and S1D). These results indicate that\n\nAA regulates Ypt1 and its GTP-dependent interaction with\n\nTORC1.\n\nAA Stimulates Rab1A Interaction with mTORC1 in a\nGTP- and Golgi-Dependent Manner in HEK293E cells\nA recent RNAi screen revealed that dRAB1 knockdown in\n\nDrosophila S2 cells strongly inhibits dS6K phosphorylation\n\n(Li et al., 2010), suggesting that the Rab1 function in TORC1\n\nsignaling is conserved. To further explore this, we knocked\n\ndown Rab1A in human embryonic kidney 293E (HEK293E)\n\ncells with three distinct Rab1A small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs),\n\nall of which efficiently downregulate Rab1A expression and\n\ninhibit the phosphorylation of S6K1(T389) but not AKT(S473),\n\nindicating that Rab1A is specifically required for mTORC1\n\nsignaling (Figure 2A). Rab1A knockdown attenuates the\n\nactivation of mTORC1 by AA (Figure 2B). In contrast, mTORC1\n\ncan still be stimulated by insulin after Rab1A knockdown\n\n(albeit the overall mTORC1 signaling level is decreased) (Figure\n\n2C). The latter phenomenon is similar to that of Rag knock-\n\ndown (Kim et al., 2008).Therefore, Rab1A function in AA\n\nsignaling is conserved in humans. Of note, Rab1A knockdown\n\ndoes not cause cell death, as judged by lack of PARP cleav-\n\nage (Figure 2A), which is consistent with the mTORC1-specific\n\nfunction for Rab1A.\n\nAs in yeast, endogenous Rab1A also interacts with mTORC1\n\n(Figure 2D). Hemagglutinin (HA)-Rab1A is associated with\n\nmTOR and Raptor, not Rictor (Figure S2A), and is bound more\n\nwith Myc-Raptor than Myc-mTOR (Figures S2B and S2C). Myc-\n\nRaptor, not Myc-mTOR, remained associated with HA-Rab1A\n\nafter the immunocomplex was washed with 0.5% TX-100, a con-\n\ndition known to disrupt mTORC1 (Figure S2D), indicating that\n\nRaptor mediates the binding of Rab1A. Rab1A is a small GTP-\n\nbinding protein anchored on ER and Golgi membranes through\n\nprenylation (Calero et al., 2003; Gomes et al., 2003). mTOR\n\npreferentially binds to Rab1A-GTP (Rab1A-Q70L, Rab1AGTP)\n\n(Pind et al., 1994) compared with Rab1A-GDP (Rab1A-S25N,\n\nRab1AGDP) (Alvarez et al., 2003) or a Rab1AC202, 203S mutant\n\n(Rab1AC2S) deficient of prenylation and ER/Golgi localization\n\n(Calero et al., 2003; Gomes et al., 2003) (Figure 2E).\n\nUpon AA stimulation, there is a significant increase in the GTP-\n\nbinding activity of Rab1A (Figures 2F and 2G). Moreover, AA reg-\n\nulates the Rab1A interaction with mTORC1 in a GTP-dependent\n\nmanner (Figure 2H). Strikingly, Rab1AGTP binds persistently to\n\nmTORC1 and sustains mTORC1 signaling even during AA star-\n\nvation (Figures 2H and 2I). In contrast, serum and insulin do not\n\naffect Rab1A GTP-binding (Figure 2J) or the Rab1A-mTORC1\ncer Cell 26, 754\u2013769, November 10, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc. 755\n\n\n\nA B\n\nE\n\nD\n\nWT\n\nypt10\u2206\n\nypt11\u2206\n\ntor1\u2206\n\nypt52\u2206\n\nypt53\u2206\n\nWT\n\ntet-YPT1\n\ntet-SEC4\n\nypt31\u2206\n\nypt32\u2206\n\nypt6\u2206\n\nypt7\u2206\n\nF\n\nypt51\u2206\n\nWT\n\nypt1-ts\n\nG\n\nWT\n\ntet-YPT1\n\ntet-SEC4\n\n      Rap       Rap\n\n      Rap       Rap\n\n       Rap\n\n       Rap\n\n      Rap\n\nRap      Dox Dox\n\nWT Tet -YPT1\n\nDox\nAA \n\nHA-Sch9\n\nMaf1-Myc\n\nH I\nWT ypt6\u2206 ypt7\u2206 \n\n   AA \n\nMaf1-Myc\n\nHA-Sch9\nP-Sch9\n  Sch9\n\nP-Maf1\n  Maf1\n\nP-Sch9\n  Sch9\n\nP-Maf1\n  Maf1\n\nWT pep3\u2206 pep5\u2206 vps16\u2206 vps33\u2206 \n\nHA-\nSch9\n\nMaf1-\nMyc\n\n   AA \nP-Sch9\n  Sch9\n\nP-Maf1\n  Maf1\n\nWT gtr1\u2206 gtr2\u2206 \n\nHA-Sch9\n\nMaf1-Myc\n\n  AA \nP-Sch9\n  Sch9\n\nP-Maf1\n  Maf1\n\nWT\n\npep5\u2206 \n\npep3\u2206 \n\nvps16\u2206\n\ngtr1\u2206 \n\nvps33\u2206 \n\ngtr2\u2206 \n\n      Rap       Rap\n\nC\n\nP-Sch9\n  Sch9\n\nP-Maf1\nMaf1-Myc\n\nWT\n\nSch9-HA\n\n AA \n\nGTR2GDPGTR1GTP\n\nFigure 1.

Curiously, AA starvation disrupts the association of\n\nYpt1GTP with TORC1 in yeast but not Rab1AGTP with mTORC1\n\nin humans. This is likely due to the fact that nutrients such as\n\nAA play a more prominent growth regulatory role in single-celled\n\norganisms than in mammals. The latter is regulated by nutrients\n\nas well as polypeptide factors (e.g., cytokines and hormones).\n\nConsistent with this notion, starvation of HEK293E cells of both\n\nserum and AA also blocks the binding of Rab1AGTP to mTORC1\n\n(data not shown).\nCancer Cell 26, 754\u2013769, N\nRab1A Regulates the Formation\nof the Rheb-mTORC1 Complex\nin the Golgi\nWhen ectopically expressed, Rab1A\n\nstimulates the level of P-S6K1 and\nP-4EBP1 but not P-AKT (Figures S3A and S3B), indicating\n\nthat Rab1A overexpression specifically promotes mTORC1\n\nsignaling.

Curiously, the dominant-active\n\nRagBGTP/RagCGDP can partially rescue the loss of Rab1A\n\n(Figure S3C). These observations indicate that the regulation\n\nof mTORC1 by Rab1A is dependent on Rheb but that Rab1A\n\nand Rag are relatively independent of each other, with Rab1A\n\nhaving a more prominent role, which is consistent with the\n\nyeast results.\n\nAlthough Rag GTPases regulate mTORC1 in lysosomes\n\n(Sancak et al., 2010), mTORC1 is widely distributed throughout\n\nthe cell, including the ER, the Golgi, endosomes, mitochondria,\n\nand the nucleus (Drenan et al., 2004; Li et al., 2006; Liu and\n\nZheng, 2007; Sancak et al., 2008; Schieke et al., 2006), sug-\n\ngesting that the regulation of mTORC1 signaling is more\n\ncomplex than currently thought, involving multiple subcellular\n\nsystems and mechanisms. To locate where Rab1A engages\n\nmTORC1, we used Duolink, which allows the detection of\n\nprotein-protein interactions in situ in intact cells and tissues\n\n(So\u0308derberg et al., 2006), to analyze in situ Rab1A-mTORC1\n\ninteraction. Antibodies against Rab1A and Raptor or mTOR\n\ntogether, but not each individually or under the condition that\n\none partner is knocked down, generated a strong signal in\n\nthe Golgi (Figure 3C; Figures S3D\u2013S3H). Therefore, Rab1A in-\n\nteracts with mTORC1 specifically in the Golgi, which is consis-\n\ntent with our earlier observation that Golgi localization is\n\nrequired for Rab1A to bind to and activate mTORC1 (Figure 2E;\n\nFigure S3A).\n\nTo further investigate the mechanism of mTORC1 regulation\n\nby Rab1A, we examined the localization of the Rheb-mTORC1\n\ncomplex. Rheb-Raptor interaction prominently occurs in the\n\nGolgi, as judged by conventional and confocal microscopy\n\n(Figures 3D and 3E; Figure S3D). This result is consistent\n\nwith the observation that both Rheb and mTORC1 are promi-\n\nnently localized in this organelle (Figure S3I) (Buerger et al.,\n\n2006; Drenan et al., 2004; Hanker et al., 2010; Liu and Zheng,\n\n2007). In addition, Rheb interaction with mTORC1 has been\n\nmainly detected in the Golgi in live cells (Yadav et al., 2013).\n\nRaptor-Rheb15 is a fusion protein of Raptor and the C-terminal\n\nRheb CAAX signal sequence. When expressed in cells, it\n\ncauses constitutive activation of mTORC1 (Sancak et al.,\n\n2010). Because Rheb15 contains the CAAX motif that is suffi-\n\ncient to target Rheb to the Golgi (Buerger et al., 2006; Hanker\n\net al., 2010), we investigated Raptor-Rheb15 subcellular local-\n\nization and found that it is indeed predominantly found in the\n\nGolgi (Figures S3J and S3K). Moreover, Rab1A knockdown\n\ndisrupts mTORC1 localization or Rheb-mTORC1 interaction\n\nin the Golgi (Figures 3F and 3G; Figure S3L) while not affecting\n\nmTORC1 localization or interaction with Rag in the lysosomes\n\n(Figures S3M-S3Q). Therefore, Rab1A controls mTORC1\n\nsignaling by regulating the formation of the Golgi Rheb-\n\nmTORC1 complex.\n(F) HEK293E cells were transfected with a Rab1A small interfering RNA (siRNA) or\n\nbar, 10 mm.\n\n(G) HEK293E cells transiently expressing GM130-GFP (green) were analyzed for\n\nsiRNA.

To ask whether Rab1A is also aberrantly\n\nexpressed in other malignancies, we performed immunohisto-\n\nchemistry (IHC) staining of Rab1A in primary human colorectal\n\ncancer (CRC) and adjacent normal tissues. Rab1A staining is\n\nmuch stronger (median H score, 255) in tumors than the match-\n\ning normal tissues (median H score, 40) (Figures 4A and 4B).\n\nRab1A is scored higher in approximately 80% tumors, although\n\nthe intensity is markedly variable, with IHC scores 100-fold\n\nhigher in tumors than in normal tissues (Figure 4C).\n\nWe next examined the relationship between Rab1A expres-\n\nsion and mTORC1 signaling by staining Rab1A and P-S6K1 in\n\nconsecutive tissue sections. Overall, Rab1A expression is\n\nstrongly correlated with P-S6K1 staining (Figures 4D and 4E).\n\nIn tumors with heterogeneous Rab1A expression, the P-S6K1\n\nlevel still showed a striking correlation with the Rab1A level. In\n\ntumor nodules with high Rab1A expression, P-S6K1 staining is\n\nalso stronger (Figure 4F). We further examined the relationship\n\nbetween Rab1A staining and different clinicopathologic param-\n\neters and found that high Rab1A-positive staining is statistically\n\nsignificantly correlated with poor survival (Figure 4G), increased\n\ntumor invasion, and advanced tumor stages (Table S1). In\n\naddition, high Rab1A-positive staining appears to be associated\n\nwith lymph node metastasis, but the result is not statistically\n\nsignificant because of limited sample size (Table S1). Together,\n\nthese results show that Rab1A is frequently overexpressed in\n\nCRC and that high Rab1A expression is correlated with hyper-\n\nactive mTORC1 signaling, tumor invasion and progression, and\n\npoor prognosis.\n\nRab1A Is Essential for the Oncogenic Growth of\nRab1A-Overexpressing CRC Cells\nIn a panel of CRC cell lines, Rab1A expression is also highly\n\nvariable, ranging from high (e.g., DLD-1 and CACO2) to low\n\n(e.g., RKO and COLO205) but is correlated with P-S6K1, not\n\nP-AKT (Figure 5A; Figures S4A and S4B). Therefore, these cell\n\nlines have similar characteristics as primary tumors and are\n\ngood models for studying the significance of Rab1A expression.\n\nSurprisingly, P-S6K1 is not correlated with the expression of\n\nRab1B, Rheb, RagA, RagB, RagC, and RagD (Figures S4C\u2013\n\nS4H), suggesting that, unlike Rab1A, other known mTORC1 ac-\n\ntivators are not responsible for hyperactive mTORC1 signaling\n\nin CRC cells. When Rab1A is knocked down in three pairs of\n\nCRC cell lines (DLD-1 and CACO2, KM12 and HCT116, and\n\nRKO and COLO205, representative of high, moderate and low\n\nRab1A expression in cells, respectively), mTORC1 signaling is\n\nabrogated (Figure 5B).

Of note, Rab1A knockdown did not affect cell viability\n\nbecause no significant increase in apoptotic cell death was\n\nseen (data not shown), which is consistent with the results\n\nwith HEK293E cells (Figure 2A). Furthermore, Rab1A knock-\n\ndown attenuates mTORC1 signaling (P-S6K1 staining) and\n\noncogenic growth (Ki67 staining and mitotic index) of DLD-1\n\nxenograft tumors in nude mice (Figures 5I\u20135K). The fact that\n\nRab1A knockdown preferentially inhibits CRC cells with high\n\nRab1A suggests that Rab1A overexpression is a key driver for\n\ncancer growth.\n\nRab1A Overexpression Rather Than Activated PI3K\nor MEK Is Essential for Hyperactive mTORC1 Signaling\nand Oncogenic Growth of CRC Cells\nPhosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is thought to be a major\n\nupstream regulator of mTOR signaling. DLD1, HCT116, and\n\nRKO each carry a heterozygote-activating mutant PIK3CA allele.\n\nThe P-S6K1 level is very low in RKO (Figure 5A), indicating that\n\nactivated PI3K is insufficient to promote mTORC1 signaling in\n\nRKO cells. However, P-S6K is moderate or high in DLD1 and\n\nHCT116 (Figure 5A), presenting an interesting dilemma. Is\n\nRab1A or PI3K responsible for elevated mTORC1 signaling and\n\noncogenic growth? To address this question, we analyzed the\n\nisogenic DLD1 and HCT116 cell lines in which the PIK3CAWT\n\nor PIK3CAmutant allele is deleted (Samuels et al., 2005). Deletion\n\nof thePIK3CAmutant allele abolishes AKT but not S6K1 phosphor-\n\nylation (Figures 6A; Figure S5A), which is in contrast to Rab1A\n\nknockdown, which abolishes mTORC1 signaling (Figure 6A).\n\nMoreover, Rab1A knockdown, rather than PIK3CAmutant dele-\n\ntion, attenuates CRC cell growth and colony formation (Figures\n\n6B\u20136E). This result is consistent with a previous report showing\n\nthat the activated PI3K mutant is responsible for enhanced\n\nsurvival but not growth of CRC cells (Samuels et al., 2005). The\n\nRas/MEK/ERK pathway is another major mitogenic signaling\n\npathway that is frequently mutated in CRC. However, MEK\n\ninhibition had little effect on mTORC1 signaling, cell growth, or\n\ncolony formation of DLD1 and CACO2 cells that both have\n\nRab1A overexpression and high ERK signaling (Figures S5B\u2013\n\nS5D). These data show that Rab1A-AA signaling, rather than\n\nPI3K and the MEK pathway, is crucial for hyperactive mTORC1\n\nsignaling and growth of DLD1, HCT116, and CACO2 cells.\n\nCRC Cells with Rab1A Overexpression Are Addictive\nto AA for Growth\nBecause Rab1A mediates AA signaling to activate mTORC1,\n\nwe investigated how AA modulates CRC oncogenic growth\n(C) Scatter plot showing the Rab1A staining level in individual tumors as a ratio o\n\n(D) Consecutive CRC tissue sections were stained for Rab1A and P-S6K1.

There is a\n\nstriking inverse relationship between Rab1A expression and\n\ncell growth during AA restriction. DLD1 and CACO2 cells\n\n(high Rab1A expression) are much more sensitive to AA restric-\n\ntion than RKO and COLO205 (low Rab1A expression), whereas\n\nHCT116 and KM12 (modest Rab1A expression) are inter-\n\nmediate (Figure 6F). For example, the growth of DLD1 and\n\nCACO2 cells is reduced by nearly 50% in culture medium\n\nsupplied with 75% AA (Figure 6F). In contrast, that of RKO\n\nand COLO205 remains normal. On the other hand, no sig-\n\nnificant correlation is seen between Rab1A expression and\n\nthe sensitivity to serum or glucose starvation (Figures 6G\n\nand 6H; Figure S5E). These observations suggest that CRC\n\ncells with Rab1A overexpression are highly addictive to AA\n\nfor growth.\n\nRab1A Overexpression Promotes Oncogenic\nTransformation and Malignant Growth\nTo evaluate the pathological consequence of Rab1A overex-\n\npression, we ectopically expressed GFP or GFP-Rab1A in NIH\n\n3T3 cells. As observed in HEK293E cells, GFP-Rab1A stimulates\n\nS6K1 phosphorylation compared with GFP (Figure 7A) and the\n\ngrowth and colony formation of NIH 3T3 cells (Figures 7B and\n\n7C; Figure S6A). These cells also form large foci in confluent cul-\n\nture and exhibit anchorage-independent growth (Figures 7D and\n\n7E; Figure S6B). In contrast, the H-RasV12 mutant does not sig-\n\nnificantly affect mTORC1 signaling or promote oncogenic\n\ngrowth (Figures 7A\u20137E; Figures S6A and S6B). Of note, cells\n\nwith GFP-Rab1A display similar oncogenic growth in the\n\nabsence or presence of H-RasV12, indicating that Rab1A does\n\nnot cooperate with H-RasV12 in oncogenic transformation.\n\nCompared with WT Rab1A, Rab1A-GTP further promotes,\n\nwhereas Rab1A-GDP and Rab1A-C2S reduce, cell growth (Fig-\n\nure S6C), which is consistent with their mTORC1-activating\n\nactivity.\n\nWe further evaluated the oncogenic potential of Rab1A in vivo\n\nby injecting nude mice with NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing\n\nGFP-Rab1A or GFP. Control cells have a low propensity to\n\nform tiny tumors in nude mice (6 out of 12) (Figures 7F and\n\n7G), which is consistent with previously studies (Greig et al.,\n\n1985; Rong et al., 1994). In contrast, GFP-Rab1A cells form large\n\ntumors with 100% efficiency (12 out of 12) (Figures 7F and 7G).\n\nHistologically, GFP-Rab1A tumors display elevated S6K1 phos-\n\nphorylation and malignant phenotypes (e.g., high cell density,\n\nmitotic index, and nuclear variability) (Figure 7H). These results\n\nindicate that Rab1A overexpression is sufficient to transform\n\nimmortalized cells.\nf Rab1A staining in CRC versus paired non-cancerous tissue.\n\nare representative cases with high, moderate, or negative Rab1A staining and\n\nwas evaluated by a nonparametric Spearman test.

GFP-\n\nRab1A overexpression enhances S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig-\n\nure 7I) and promotes RKO cell growth and colony formation\n\n(Figures 7J and 7K) and xenograft tumor growth in nude mice\n\n(Figures 7L and 7M). RKO tumors expressing GFP-Rab1A\n\nshow elevated P-S6K1 and an elevatedmitotic index (Figure 7N).\n\nTherefore, Rab1A overexpression can also enhance the malig-\n\nnant growth of established tumors. To determine the depen-\n\ndence of Rab1A-mediated transformation on Rheb and Rag\n\nGTPases, we knocked down Rheb or RagA/RagB in RKO cells\n\noverexpressing GFP-Rab1A. Downregulation of Rheb and\n\nRaptor much more significantly attenuates Rab1A-stimulated\n\nmTORC1 signaling, cell growth, and colony formation than\n\nknockdown of RagA and RagB (Figures S6D\u2013S6F). Therefore,\n\nRab1A is primarily dependent on Rheb for stimulation of\n\nmTORC1 signaling and oncogenic growth.\n\nRab1A Overexpression Promotes mTORC1-Dependent\nOncogenic Growth and Determines Rapamycin\nSensitivity in CRC\nSuccessful targeted cancer therapy hinges on hyperactivation\n\nof the target signaling pathway (Shawver et al., 2002). Cancer\n\ncells become dependent on, or \u2018\u2018addicted to\u2019\u2019 such \u2018\u2018growth\n\ndriver\u2019\u2019 pathway, rendering these cells prone to the targeted\n\ntreatment. We therefore investigated the relationship between\n\nRab1A overexpression and rapamycin sensitivity. Indeed,\n\nthere is a strong correlation between Rab1A expression and\n\ngrowth inhibition in the panel of CRC cell lines, with the highest\n\nrapamycin sensitivity for DLD1 and CACO2 and the lowest for\n\nRKO and COLO205 (Figure 8A). To verify this finding in vivo,\n\nwe generated DLD1 and RKO xenograft tumors, representing\n\nCRC with high and low Rab1A expression, respectively. After\n\ntumors were established, the animals were treated with rapa-\n\nmycin or a control vehicle. Rapamycin completely blocks the\n\ngrowth of DLD1 tumors but has no discernible effect on RKO\n\ntumors (Figure 8B), despite strong on-target inhibition of\n\nmTORC1 signaling by rapamycin (Figure 8C). Moreover, rapa-\n\nmycin abrogates the elevated mTORC1 signaling, growth,\n\nand colony formation of NIH 3T3 and RKO cells driven by\n\nRab1A overexpression (Figures 8D and 8E), indicating that\n\nthe oncogenic growth by Rab1A overexpression is indeed\n\nmediated by mTORC1. Together, these results demonstrate\n\nthat Rab1A overexpression drives mTORC1-dependent onco-\n\ngenic growth and determines drug sensitivity to mTORC1-\n\ntargeted therapy in CRC.\nFigure 5.

Here we describe a Rab1\n\nfunction that mediates AA signaling to activate mTORC1.\n\nDownregulation of Rab1 inhibits mTORC1 activation by AA in\n\nyeast and humans, indicating that this Rab1 function is well\n\nconserved. Mechanistically, AA stimulates Rab1A GTP binding\n\nand the GTP-dependent interaction with mTORC1 in the Golgi.\n\nRab1 does not directly activate mTORC1 kinase activity (data\n\nnot shown). Instead, it regulates Rheb interaction with mTORC1\n\nin the Golgi. Together, these observations show that Rab1 uses\n\nthe Golgi as an anchor to regulate mTORC1 activation by Rheb\n\nin response to AA sufficiency.\n\nRab1A and Rag both interact with mTORC1 in response to AA\n\nsufficiency and promote the colocalization of mTORC1 with\n\nRheb. However, they are anchored on two distinct endomem-\n\nbrane systems, with Rag on the lysosomes and Rab1A on the\n\nGolgi. Rab1A knockdown blocks Rheb-mTORC1 interaction on\n\nthe Golgi but not the lysosomes (Figure 8F). Rab1A overexpres-\n\nsion rescues the ability of AA to activate mTORC1 in the absence\n\nof RagA/RagB, whereas overexpression of the hyperactive\n\nRagBGTP/RagCGDP complex partially restores AA activation of\n\nmTORC1 when Rab1A is knocked down. In addition, Rab1A\n\nrequires Rheb, but not Rag, to stimulate mTORC1 signaling\n\nand oncogenic growth in CRC cells. These observations suggest\n\nthat Rab1A and Rag operate as two independent axes of AA\n\nsignaling to mTORC1. Interestingly, constitutively activated\n\nRag GTPases in humans, but not in yeast, partially rescue\n\nmTORC1 activation by AA in the absence of Rab1A, suggesting\n\nthat Rag gains a bigger role in AA signaling during evolution.\n\nBecause AAs are essential for cell growth and metabolism, it\n\nmakes sense for eukaryotic cells to add redundant signaling\n\nmodules, Rab1 and Rag, to transduce AA signals, which ensures\n\nthe reliable transmission of this crucial mitogenic signal. In addi-\n\ntion, it is possible that the two signaling branches have distinct\n\nfunctions to provide finer control of the signaling process (e.g.,\n\nengaging in external versus internal AA signals or a different\n\ntype of AA).\n\nSmall GTPases such as Ras, Rho, Rac, and Ral are known for\n\ntheir roles in cancer initiation and development. Rab proteins\n\nconstitute one of the largest subfamilies of small GTPases\n\nand are generally regarded as housekeeping proteins involved\n\nin intracellular membrane dynamics.

Interestingly, Rab1A has been re-\n\nported previously to be highly overexpressed in human tongue\n\nsquamous cell carcinomas (Shimada et al., 2005). Here we\n\nreport that Rab1A is overexpressed in CRC. In addition, Rab1A\n\nis overexpressed in breast and liver tumors (unpublished data).\n\nThese results indicate that aberrant Rab1A expression is a gen-\n\neral phenomenon in human malignancies. Although PI3K acts\n\nupstream of mTORC1, surprisingly, activating PI3K mutations\n\nin CRC do not promote mTORC1 signaling or oncogenic growth.\n\nMoreover, the expression of several other mTORC1 activators\n\nsuch as Rheb and Rag is not correlated with mTORC1 activity.\n764 Cancer Cell 26, 754\u2013769, November 10, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc\nThese observations suggest that tumors selectively activate\n\nRab1A-dependent mTORC1 signaling through Rab1A overex-\n\npression to gain an oncogenic advantage.\n\nAlthough Rab1A expression has been reported to be elevated\n\nin tongue cancer, the significance of Rab1 overexpression\n\nremained unclear. Here we show that Rab1A overexpression is\n\nsufficient to transform immortalized fibroblasts and promote\n\nmalignant growth of established tumor cells, suggesting that\n\nRab1A is capable of promoting both oncogenic transforma-\n\ntion and growth.

Remark-\n\nably, CRC cells with Rab1A overexpression are highly depen-\n\ndent on AA, suggesting that elevated AA signaling renders can-\n\ncer cells addictive to AA. AA signaling is increasingly recognized\n\nas a key mitogenic event, but its role in cancer remains relative\n\nobscure. A recent study implicated GATOR, the GTPase-acti-\n\nvating protein (GAP) for Rag A/RagB as potential tumor suppres-\n\nsor (Bar-Peled et al., 2013). However, genomic mutation of\n\nGATOR components appears to be relatively rare. In contrast,\n\nRab1A overexpression is widespread in human malignancies,\n\nsuggesting that aberrant AA signaling as a result of Rab1 over-\n\nexpression is a common mechanism to promote oncogenic\n\ntransformation and growth.\n\nmTOR is a major cancer therapeutic target (Bjornsti and\n\nHoughton, 2004; Tsang et al., 2007), with two rapalogs (temsiro-\n\nlimus and everolimus) presently used in the clinic. Although\n\nupstream regulators of mTORC1 such as PI3K and PTEN are\n\ncommonly mutated in human tumors, such mutations have not\n\ncorrelated well with clinical responses (Don and Zheng, 2011).\n\nThis is consistent with the observations that PI3K mutant is not\n\nresponsible for mTORC1 activation and that it promotes survival\n\nrather than oncogenic growth in CRC (Samuels et al., 2005).\n\nOur data indicate that Rab1A overexpression is a driver for\n\nmTORC1-dependent growth, which is correlated with CRC\n\nsensitivity to rapamycin. Further research in this area could\n\nlead to a predictive biomarker for improving mTORC1-targeted\n\ntherapy. In addition to cancer, Rab1A is upregulated in a dilated\n\ncardiomyopathy model, and heart-specific Rab1A transgenes\n\nare sufficient to cause cardiac hypertrophy in a gene dosage-\n\ndependent manner in mice (Wu et al., 2001). It is noteworthy\n\nthat rapamycin is effective to regress established cardiac\n\nhypertrophy (McMullen et al., 2004). Our findings here provide\n\na mechanistic explanation for the pathological role of Rab1A in\n\ncancer and cardiac hypertrophy.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\nPlasmids and Site-Directed Mutagenesis\n\nThe human Rab1A plasmid was a gift from Dr. Marci A. Scidmore (Rzomp\n\net al., 2003). The plasmids expressing HA-GST-Rheb1, HA-GST-Rap2A,\n\nHA-GST-RagB(Q99L), (RagBGTP), and RagC(S75L) (RagCGDP) (Sancak\n\net al., 2008) were acquired from AddGene. To generate Rab1A-GFP and\n\nRab1A-HA, Rab1A cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRV and NotI sites of\n\npEGFP-C1 and the SalI and NotI sites of pRK5, respectively. Raptor and\n\nRictor cDNAs were subcloned into the AscI and MluI sites of pCMV6-AN-\n\nMyc. Rab1AGTP (Q70L), Rab1AGDP (S22N), and Rab1AC2S (C202, 203S) were\n\ngenerated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing.\n(E) Representative images of the anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 or N\n\n(F and G) NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing GFP or GFP-Rab1A were injected subc\n\nevery 3 days.

The Tor1-\n\nspecific antibody has been described previously (Li et al., 2006). Horseradish\n\nperoxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were from Santa-Cruz Biotech-\n\nnology. Antibodies for mTOR (catalog no. 2983), Raptor (catalog no. 2280),\n\nRheb (catalog no. 4935), RagA (catalog no. 4537), RagB (catalog no. 8150),\n\nRagC (catalog no. 5466), RagD (catalog no. 4470), Lamp1 (catalog no.\n\n9091), Rictor, P-S6K1(T398), S6K1, P-AKT(S473), AKT, P-4E-BP1(T37/46),\n\n4E-BP1, ERK, P-ERK(T202/Y204), a-tubulin, and the Myc-epitope were from\n\nCell Signaling Technology. The antibody for the HA epitope was from Bethyl\n\nLaboratories. The antibodies for Rab1A and P-S6K1(T398) for IHC and the\n\nLamp2 antibody (catalog no. ab25630) were from Abcam. The antibody for\n\nRab1A (catalog no. 11671 for western blot and immunoprecipitation IP) and\n\nRab1B were from Proteintech Group. The Rab1A antibody for immunofluo-\n\nrescence (IF) (catalog no. H00005861-M07A) was from Abnova. Protein G-\n\nSepharose was from GE Healthcare. EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor\n\ncocktail and PhosSTOP were from Roche. Rapamycin and PD98059 were\n\nfrom Selleck Chemicals. Cell lysis and western blot (Drenan et al., 2004; San-\n\ncak et al., 2008) and immunoprecipitation (Sancak et al., 2008) were performed\n\nas described previously. For determining whether Ratpor or mTOR mediates\n\nthe interaction with Rab1A, anti-Rab1A immunoprecipitates were washed\n\nwith cell lysis buffer containing 0.25% or 0.50% TX-100.\n\nXenograft Tumors and Drug Therapy in Athymic Nude Mice\n\nTo generate xenograft tumors, a total of 53 106 to 13 107 cells in 100 ml PBS\n\nwere injected subcutaneously into 4-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. The\n\ntumor volume was measured using a Vernier caliper and calculated according\n\nto the formula tumor volume (mm3) = (shorter diameter23 longer diameter) / 2.\n\nThe tumor volume was measured every other day and is presented as\n\nmeans \u00b1 SD. At the endpoint, mice were sacrificed, and tumors were removed\n\nand photographed. For drug therapy experiments, DLD-1 and RKO cells\n\nwere injected subcutaneously into nude mice to establish a xenograft model.\n\nAfter tumors were established, rapamycin was administered with 5 mg/kg\n\nrapamycin dissolved in DMSO and sterile saline by daily intraperitoneal injec-\n\ntions for 10\u201312 days. Drug vehicle-treated mice received a daily injection\n\nof identical solution without rapamycin. At least six mice were included in\n\neach treatment group. Animal experiments were approved by Rutgers and\n\nShanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine (SJTUSM) Animal Care\n\nand Use committees.\n\nCRC Tissue Array and Immunohistochemistry\n\nNinety pairs of deidentified malignant infiltrating CRC tumors with paired\n\nnoncancerous samples (cutting edge of surgical excision beyond 5 cm\n\nfrom the cancer areas) were randomly obtained from July 2006 to August\n\n2007. The CRC tissue array was prepared by Shanghai OUTDO Biotech\n\n(Shanghai, China). The survival time was calculated from the day of operation\n\nto the end of the follow-up or the date of death because of the recurrence and\n\nmetastasis.

The streptavidin-biotin complex method was used in\n\nimmunohistochemistry to detect Rab1A and P-S6K1(T389). Primary anti-\n\nbodies against Rab1A and P-S6K1(T389) were used at a concentration of\n\n1:400 and 1:50, respectively. To score a tumor cell as positive, both cyto-\n\nplasmic and nuclear staining were counted. For the quantitative analysis, a\n\nHisto score (H score) was calculated based on the staining intensity and per-\n\ncentage of stained cells using the Aperio ScanScope systems. The intensity\n\nscore was defined as follows: 0, no appreciable staining in cells; 1, weak\n\nstaining in cells comparable with stromal cells; 2, intermediate staining; 3,\n\nstrong staining. The fraction of positive cells was scored as 0%\u2013100%. The\n\nH score was calculated by multiplying the intensity score and the fraction\n\nscore, producing a total range of 0\u2013300. A cutoff of 30 was used for P-\n\nS6K1 positivity and 90 for Rab1A positivity. Tissue sections were examined\n\nand scored separately by two independent investigators blinded to the clini-\n\ncopathologic data.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were carried out using SAS 9.13 software. The statistical\n\nanalysis of numeration data was done using Pearson\u2019s chi-square test or\n\nFisher\u2019s exact chi-square test. The comparisons of continuous data be-\n\ntween groups were performed using Student\u2019s t tests or Wilcoxon signed\n\nrank test. A nonparametric Spearman correlation test was performed to\n\nanalyze the correlation between Rab1A and P-S6K1 expression levels. For\n\nsurvival analysis, data collection was locked on August 16, 2011. Kaplan-\n\nMeier plots and log rank tests were applied to determine the significance\n\nof differences in cumulative survival. All statistical tests were conducted at\n\na two-sided significance level of 0.05.
