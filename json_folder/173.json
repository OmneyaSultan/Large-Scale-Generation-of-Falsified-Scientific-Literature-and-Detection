Zhang).\n1 Hong-Xia Wang and Dong-Mei Zhang contributed\na b s t r a c t\n\nShort, nonlethal ischemic episodes administered to hearts directly after ischemic events (ischemic post-\nconditioning, IPost) have an advantage over ischemic preconditioning (IPC). The endogenous cytochrome\nP450 2J3/11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (CYP2J3/11,12-EET) is upregulated by IPost, but not IPC, in the\nrat heart. The CYP epoxygenase inhibitor N-methylsulphonyl-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl) hexanamide\n(MS-PPOH) reduces the cardioprotective effects of IPost, but not IPC. We proposed that upregulation of\nCYP2J3/11,12-EET during IPost induces cardioprotection by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and that\nmultiple apoptotic signals, including changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mito-\nchondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage, caspase-3\nlevels, and levels of protective kinases such as Bcl-2 and Bax, are involved in the process. Neonatal rat\ncardiomyocytes underwent 3-h hypoxia followed by 2-, 5-, or 6-h reoxygenation (H/R) or three cycles\nof 5-min reoxygenation followed by 5-min hypoxia before 90-min reoxygenation (HPost); or were trans-\nfected with pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 for 48 h before H/R; or were treated with MS-PPOH for 10 min before\nHPost. For HPost alone, pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 transfection attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis to 68.4%\n(p < 0.05) of that with H/R. pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 transfection significantly decreased MMP and inhibited\nmPTP opening induced by H/R, reduced mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage, cleaved caspase-3 protein\nexpression, and increased the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax expression. MS-PPOH abolished this effect. Therefore,\nupregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during HPost is involved in cardioprotection by inhibiting apoptosis\nvia a caspase-dependent pathway, and the apoptosis-suppressive effect may have important clinical\nimplications during HPost.\n\n\ufffd 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n1. Introduction\n\nCycles of brief reperfusion and ischemia performed immedi-\nately at the onset of reperfusion following prolonged ischemia\nmarkedly limit reperfusion injury [1]. Zhao et al. named this car-\ndioprotective phenomenon \u2018\u2018ischemia postconditioning\u2019\u2019 (IPost),\nwhich is as powerful as ischemic preconditioning (IPC) [2,3]. IPost\nhas been demonstrated in isolated perfused hearts [4] and in many\nin vivo models and species [5] such as dogs [2], rabbits [6], rats [4],\npigs [7], and, recently, humans [8]. IPost has great advantages over\nIPC after myocardial infarction. For promising clinical application\nElsevier Ltd.\n\nathophysiology, Capital Med-\ng 100069, China.

The CYP epoxygenase\ninhibitor MS-PPOH reduces the cardioprotective effects of IPost,\nbut not IPC [9]. Therefore, upregulation of the CYP2J3/EET system\nduring IPost may be a novel signaling mechanism protecting\nagainst ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and may be distinct from\nIPC. However, the precise mechanisms mediating the protective ef-\nfects of IPost by CYP2J3/EET remain unclear.\n\nRecently, IPost was suggested to attenuate lethal reperfusion in-\njury by opening mitochondrial KATP channels and reactive oxygen\nspecies signaling, which may lead to reduced mitochondrial cal-\ncium accumulation and inhibition of mitochondrial permeability\ntransition pore (mPTP) opening [10\u201312]. Inhibition of mPTP open-\ning is a critical end effector of the cardioprotective effects of IPost\n[11,13]. mPTP opening occurs during reperfusion and appears to be\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.04.029\nmailto:zlk30@tom.com\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.04.029\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine\n\n\nH.-X.

We also systematically\ninvestigated multiple downstream apoptotic signals, including\nchanges in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mPTP\nopening, mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage, levels of cleaved\ncaspase-3 expression, and levels of protective kinases such as\nBcl-2 and Bax. Our data suggest that upregulation of CYP2J3/\n11,12-EET during HPost in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes involves\ncardioprotection by inhibition of apoptosis via a caspase-depen-\ndent pathway.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nNeonatal Wistar rats (1\u20133 days old) were provided by the Ani-\nmal Department of Capital Medical University. Fetal calf serum\n(FCS), Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), and strepto-\nmycin/penicillin were from Gibco BRL (Life Technologies, Paisley,\nUK). MS-PPOH was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA),\nand solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (Oasis HLB) were from\nWaters (Milford, MA, USA). Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 Transfection Re-\nagent, JC-1, and calcein-AM were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA,\nUSA), and CoCl2 was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Trizol re-\nagent and the reverse transcription system were from Promega\n(Madison, WI, USA). Sequences of oligonucleotide primers for RT-\nPCR analysis were synthesized by Sai Bai Sheng (Beijing). CYP2J3\npolyclonal antibody was from Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology.\nAnti-GADPH antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa\nCruz, CA, USA). Anti-cytochrome c, -Bax, -BCL-2, and -cleaved cas-\npase-3 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,\nMA, USA). Other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade.\n\n2.2. Isolation and culture of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes\n\nThe hearts of rats were excised, and the ventricular myocar-\ndium was cut into small pieces (\ufffd2 mm3) in phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS) buffer with trypsin (1.125 mg/ml), collagenase I\nFig. 1. Study groups and experimental protocol. Protocols for pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 and MS\nreoxygenation\u2013hypoxia; HPost, hypoxia post-conditioning; MS-PPOH, N-methylsulphon\n(1 mg/ml), and collagenase II (0.5 mg/ml) and incubated on a sha-\nker for 20 min at 37 \ufffdC and 100 rpm. Tissue pieces were allowed to\nsettle, and the supernatant (containing myocytes) was collected\nand suspended, then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The cell\npellet was resuspended and stored at 37 \ufffdC. The cells were then\nresuspended in DMEM with 20% FCS and 0.5% penicillin/strepto-\nmycin for 30 min to facilitate separation of ventricular myocytes\nfrom the faster-attaching non-myocytes. The ventricular myocytes\nwere collected and plated on gelatin-coated dishes. Cells were used\nfor experiments after demonstrating rhythmic contractions\n(48\u201372 h).\n2.3. Construction and identification of pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3\n\nThe total RNA was extracted from rat livers. The cDNA of CYP2J3\nwas amplified by RT-PCR and OE-PCR and inserted into a pBS-T\nvector. The recombinants were checked by PCR and digested by a\nrestriction endonuclease. The CYP2J3 gene was confirmed by\nDNA sequencing and cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector\nof the pcDNA3.1, and pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 was produced. Cultured\nmyocardial cells of rats were transfected with pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3\nby a FuGENE HD transfection agent.\n2.4. Study groups and experimental protocol\n\nNeonatal rat cardiomyocytes were divided into seven groups for\ntreatment (Fig. 1): Control, no treatment; H/R, 3-h hypoxia followed\nby 2-, 5-, or 6-h reoxygenation; HPost, three cycles of 5-min reoxy-\ngenation followed by 5-min hypoxia before 90-min reoxygenation;\nHPC, three cycles of 5-min hypoxia followed by 5-min reoxygena-\ntion before 2.5-h hypoxia; pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 + H/R, transfection\nfor 48 h, then H/R; MS-PPOH + HPost, MS-PPOH administered\n10 min before HPost; pcDAN3.1-CYP2J3 or MS-PPOH, pcDAN3.1-\nCYP2J3 transfection or MS-PPOH administration alone.\n2.5. Cell viability assay\n\nCell viability was determined by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-\nyl)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assay [16]. Cells were\ncultured in 96-well plates, and MTT was added to each well under\nsterile conditions (with a final concentration of 5 mg/ml) immedi-\nately after reoxygenation. Plates were then incubated for 4 h at\n37 \ufffdC. The supernatant was removed, and dimethylsulfoxide was\nadded. Plates were then agitated on a plate shaker. The absorbance\nof each well was measured at 490 nm with a Wellscan MK 3 auto-\nmated EIA Analyzer (Labsystems Dragon, Taiwan).

Wang et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 360\u2013368\ncontrol cells was considered to be 100%, and that of other cells was\nexpressed as a percentage of control.\n\n2.6. Quantification of 11,12-EET in cultured medium of neonatal rat\ncardiomyocytes\n\n11,12-EET was detected by high-performance liquid chroma-\ntography (HPLC) (Agilent 1100 System; Agilent Technologies, Palo\nAlto, CA, USA), as previously described [17]. Briefly, up to 200 ll\ncultured medium was added to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with\n200 ll methanol and 0.4 ll of 96% formic acid on ice before centri-\nfugation at 14,000g for 10 min at 4 \ufffdC. The supernatant was trans-\nferred to a fresh tube and diluted to 10% methanol by the addition\nof 1.8 ml water. The diluted supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml\nOasis HLB SPE cartridge (Waters) on a vacuum manifold. The SPE\ncartridge had been preconditioned by low flow in the sequence\n1 ml methanol, 1 ml acetone, 2 ml hexane, 1 ml acetone, 1 ml\nmethanol, and 2 ml water. The cartridge was washed with 3 ml\nwater, then 1 ml of 10% methanol before being allowed to dry un-\nder argon for 10 min. The eicosanoid metabolites were collected by\nelution with 2 ml anhydrous acetonitrile and then dried under a\nstream of argon. Standards or samples were dissolved in 136 ll\nanhydrous acetonitrile, 4 lL N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and\n10 ll 2-(2,3-naphthalimino)ethyl-trifluoromethanesulfonate and\nkept at 4 \ufffdC for 30 min. The reactions were terminated with argon\nto evaporate the solution to dryness.\n\nSamples were resuspended in 40 ll methanol and analyzed by\nHPLC. Mobile phase A comprised 0.5% formic acid in water, and\nmobile phase B comprised 0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile. A flow\nrate of 1 ml/min was used to deliver mobile phase A and B gradi-\nents as follows: 50\u201365% mobile phase B for 4 min; 65\u2013100% mobile\nphase B for 80 min; and 100% mobile phase B for 20 min. The fluo-\nrescence detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 260 nm\nand emission wavelength of 396 nm. Concentrations of 11,12-EET\nwere calculated by comparison against a standard curve.\n\n2.7. Apoptosis assessment\n\nWe used two methods to determine apoptosis of cardiomyo-\ncytes: nuclear staining with the chromatin dye Hochest 33258\nand terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-\nend labeling (TUNEL), widely used to detect DNA fragmentation\nin situ and performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nBriefly, cells were fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at\n4 \ufffdC. After three washes in PBS, cells were permeabilized with\n0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, then incubated\nwith 50 ll TUNEL reaction mixture for 30 min at 37 \ufffdC. Diam-\ninobenzidine was used to generate an insoluble colored substrate\nat the site of DNA fragmentation. Finally, the cells were exposed\nto Hoechst 33258 (10 lg/ml) for 5 min and examined under a\nmicroscope. For TUNEL analysis, the percentage of dead cells was\ncalculated as the ratio of TUNEL-positive cells to total number of\ncells, counted in three different random fields.\n\n2.8. Measurement of MMP by florescent JC1\n\nMMP was estimated by fluorescence of aggregates of JC-1 (tet-\nrachloro-1,10,3,30-tetraethyl-60,6,50,5-benzamidazolocarbocyanin\niodide) formed as a function of inner MMP. The formation of JC-1\naggregates and their fluorescence linearly corresponds to increases\nin membrane potential [18]. After treatment, cells plated on 24-\nwell plates were incubated with 10 lg/mL JC-1 for 20 min at\n37 \ufffdC in a humidified incubator, then washed twice with PBS for\ndetection of the fluorescence ratio (for red fluorescence: excitation,\n490 nm and emission, 590 nm; for green fluorescence: excitation,\n490 nm and emission, 527 nm). We randomly selected the region\nof interest, zoomed in the same frames. Data are presented as\nthe relative ratio of red to green fluorescence intensity.\n\n2.9. Determination of mPTP opening\n\nThe opening of the transient mPTP was directly assessed by co-\nloading with calcein-AM and CoCl2 as previously described [19].\nCalcein-AM is permeable to intact membranes, but not to intact\nmitochondrial membranes, and mPTP opening results in exit of cal-\ncein. Thus, the condition allows for monitoring of calcein fluores-\ncence in mitochondria of intact cells. In brief, cardiomyocytes\nwere loaded for 15 min with 2 lM calcein-AM in working solution\nat room temperature and then washed free of calcein-AM and CoCl2.\nThe rates of calcein-AM loading and exit were measured by record-\ning the fluorescence signal every 5 min with the Turner Quantech\nDigital Filter Fluorometer (Barnstead/Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA,\nUSA; excitation filter NB488 and emission filter SC515) and calcu-\nlated as the percentage change to maximal fluorescence signal.\n\n2.10. Isolation of mitochondria\n\nIsolation of mitochondria was performed according to the\ninstructions for the Mitochondria/Cytosol Isolation Kit for Cultured\nCells. The cells were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold\nMito-Cyto Buffer with a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation\ntwice at 800g for 5 min at 4 \ufffdC, the supernatant was collected, trans-\nferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 12,000g for\n10 min at 4 \ufffdC. The pellet, which contained the mitochondria, was\nresuspended in 30 ll of Mito-Cyto Buffer for further use.\n\n2.11. Western blot analysis\n\nTotal protein (80 or 100 mg) isolated from neonatal rat cardio-\nmyocytes was separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and blotted onto polyvinyl-\nidene difluoride (Hybond ECL, Amersham). The membranes were\nblocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline\u2013Tween\n(TBST; 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) for 2 h at\nroom temperature before being incubated overnight at 4 \ufffdC with\nanti-CYP2J3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000), anti-Bcl-2 mouse\npolyclonal antibody (1:1000), anti-Bax rabbit polyclonal antibody\n(1:1000), anti-caspase-3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000), and\nanti-GAPDH goat monoclonal antibody (1:1000 in 0.5% milk in\nTBST). After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incu-\nbated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled or fluorescence-labeled\nsecondary antibody or in TBST. After extensive washing in TBST,\nmembranes were developed by use of an enhanced chemilumines-\ncence kit.\n\n2.12. Statistical analysis\n\nAll values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD and were analyzed\nusing SPSS 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Furthermore, the content of 11,12-EET in the\ncultured medium was increased by 30.7% with overexpression of\nCYP2J3 compared with the control (Fig. 2C). Thus, a single admin-\nistration of pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 to neonatal rat cardiomyocytes sig-\nnificantly increased both CYP2J3 protein expression and activity\nin vitro.\n\n3.2. Cell viability\n\nCompared with the control, H/R decreased cell viability by 45.5%\n(0.99 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 0.54 \u00b1 0.03, n = 8, p < 0.01), which suggests that the\nH/R model was successful (Fig. 3). Viability was ameliorated with\nHPost treatment (0.83 \u00b1 0.03, n = 8, p < 0.01) and overexpression\nof CYP2J3 with H/R (0.81 \u00b1 0.09, p < 0.01), but not inhibition of\nCYP2J3 (MS-PPOH treatment) with HPost (0.62 \u00b1 0.05, p < 0.01).\nNeither pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor MSPPOH alone had an effect on cell\nviability.\n\n3.3. CYP2J3/11,12-EET was upregulated during HPost, but not HPC\n\nCompared with the control, CYP2J3 protein expression in H/R\ngroup decreased by 79.3% (2.08 \u00b1 0.49 vs. 0.43 \u00b1 0.07, n = 4,\np < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). The content of 11,12-EET with H/R was de-\ncreased by 85.7% (0.56 \u00b1 0.07 vs. 0.08 \u00b1 0.02 ng/ll, n = 8, p < 0.01)\n(Fig. 4B). HPost, but not HPC, increased CYP2J3 protein expression\nand 11,12-EET content [(0.43 \u00b1 0.07, H/R and 2.02 \u00b1 0.23, HPost;\nn = 4, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A) and (0.08 \u00b1 0.02, H/R and 0.27 \u00b1 0.02,\nHPost; n = 8, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B), respectively]. Thus, HPost but not\nHPC upregulated the expression of CYP2J3/11,12-EET.\nFig. 2. pcDNA3.1-mediated CYP2J3 epoxygenase overexpression and quantitative analysis of 11,12-EET expression in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.

Upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET inhibited cardiomyocyte\napoptosis\n\nHoechst 33258 staining revealed control cell nuclei had regular\ncontours and round or elliptical shapes (Fig. 5A). In contrast, H/R\ncells showed smaller nuclei and condensed chromatin. HPost or\noverexpression of CYP2J3 improved the morphological features\nand decreased the number of apoptotic cells induced by H/R; how-\never, MS-PPOH before HPost impaired the morphological features\nand increased the number of apoptotic cells induced by H/R. The\napoptotic results were further confirmed by TUNEL staining\n(Fig. 5B). Almost no TUNEL-positive cells could be found with con-\ntrol treatment, but many TUNEL-positive cells were found with H/\nR; the apoptosis ratio was 58.3% higher for H/R than for control\ntreatment (0.38 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 0.24 \u00b1 0.02, n = 4, p < 0.01). Compared\nwith H/R, HPost or overexpression of CYP2J3 decreased the H/R-in-\nduced apoptosis by 31.6% (HPost, 0.26 \u00b1 0.02 and pcDNA3.1-\nCYP2J3 + H/R, 0.26 \u00b1 0.02, n = 4, p < 0.05). Inhibition of CYP2J3 with\nMS-PPOH increased the apoptotic rate of HPost (0.33 \u00b1 0.02, n = 4,\np < 0.05). Neither pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor MS-PPOH alone had an ef-\nfect on cell apoptosis. Therefore, upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET\nduring HPost inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\n\n3.5. Upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during HPost decreased MMP\nand inhibited mPTP opening induced by H/R\n\nMMP is an important mediator and monitor of key cellular pro-\ncesses. It is a highly sensitive indicator of the energetic state of\nmitochondria and the health of cells [20]. Detection of mitochon-\ndrial permeability provides an early indication of the initiation of\ncellular apoptosis. By JC-1 analysis, compared with the control, H/\nR increased MMP by 54.2% (1.0 \u00b1 0.17 vs. 1.54 \u00b1 0.41, n = 4,\np < 0.01) (Fig. 6A). Compared with H/R, HPost and overexpression\nof CYP2J3 decreased MMP by 47% and 43%, respectively (HPost,\n0.81 \u00b1 0.17 and pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 + H/R, 0.88 \u00b1 0.09, n = 4,\np < 0.01). Inhibition of CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH increased MMP of\nHPost by 153.1% (1.24 \u00b1 0.32, n = 4, p < 0.01). Neither pcDNA3.1-\nCYP2J3 nor MS-PPOH alone had an effect on MMP. Therefore,\nupregulation of the CYP2J3/11,12-EET system changed HPost-in-\nduced MMP.\n\nWe investigated the occurrence and mode of mPTP opening in\nintact cells by monitoring the fluorescence of mitochondrial-en-\ntrapped calcein. We used the calcein-AM and CoCl2 co-loaded\nmethod to measure mPTP opening (Fig. 6B). Compared with the\ncontrol, H/R decreased fluorescence intensity by 33.6%\n(1.52 \u00b1 0.08 vs. 1.01 \u00b1 0.07, n = 4, p < 0.01), which indicates in-\ncreased mPTP opening; compared with H/R, HPost or overexpres-\nsion of CYP2J3 decreased mPTP opening, with fluorescence\nincreased by 28.7% and 25.7%, respectively (HPost, 1.30 \u00b1 0.11\nand pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 + H/R, 1.27 \u00b1 0.04, n = 4, p < 0.01). Inhibition\nof CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH decreased the fluorescence intensity of\nHPost by 37.7% (0.81 \u00b1 0.02, n = 4, p < 0.01). Neither pcDNA3.1-\nCYP2J3 nor MSPPOH alone had an effect on mPTP opening. There-\nfore, the CYP2J3/11,12-EET system decreased mPTP opening in-\nduced by H/R.\n\n3.6. Upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during HPost inhibited\nmitochondrial cytochrome c leakage and cleaved caspase-3 protein\nexpression\n\nIn the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, disruption of\nDwm and release of cytochrome c activate a cascade of caspases,\nincluding caspase-3, a key and irreversible point in the develop-\nment of apoptosis. Compared with the control, H/R induced serious\ndamage to the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the leakage\nof cytochrome c from the mitochondria. However, the cytochrome\nc content was significantly preserved in the HPost and pcDNA3.1-\nCYP2J3 + H/R groups. Inhibition of CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH increased\nthe leakage of cytochrome c in the MS-PPOH + HPost group. Nei-\nther pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor MSPPOH alone had an effect on the\nleakage of cytochrome c (Fig. 7).\n\nCompared with the control, H/R significantly increased cleaved\ncaspase-3 expression by 122.2% (1 vs. 2.22 \u00b1 0.39, n = 4, p < 0.01).\nHPost and overexpression of CYP2J3 significantly attenuated the\nH/R-induced increase in cleaved caspase-3 expression by 41.6%\nand 46.3%, respectively (HPost, 1.30 \u00b1 0.13 and pcDNA3.1-\nCYP2J3 + H/R, 1.19 \u00b1 0.23, n = 4, p < 0.05).\n\nInhibition of CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH increased cleaved caspase-3\nexpression of HPost by 59.6.0% (2.07 \u00b1 0.26, n = 4, p < 0.05). Neither\npcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor MSPPOH alone had an effect on cleaved cas-\npase-3 expression (Fig. 8). Therefore, the CYP2J3/11,12-EET system\nimproves apoptosis of HPost by decreasing caspase-3 expression.\n\n3.7. Upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET increased the ratio of Bcl-2 to\nBax expression induced by H/R\n\nThe Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bcl-2 play important roles in\ninitiating the mitochondrial death cascade. We used western blot\nanalysis to investigate the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and\nanti-apoptotic Bcl-2 underlying apoptosis reduced by the CYP2J3/\nEET system. Compared with the control, H/R significantly de-\ncreased the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax expression by 31.2% (1 vs.\n0.69 \u00b1 0.07, n = 4, p < 0.01) (Fig. 9). Compared with H/R, HPost\nand overexpression of CYP2J3 significantly increased the H/R-in-\n\n\n\nFig. 5. Effect of pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 or MS-PPOH on apoptosis.

Inhibition of CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH\ndecreased the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 expression of HPost by 24.5%\n(0.71 \u00b1 0.12, n = 4, p < 0.05). Neither pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 nor\nMS-PPOH alone had an effect on the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax expres-\nsion. Thus, the CYP2J3/11,12-EET system improves apoptosis of\nHPost by decreasing the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 expression.\n4. Discussion\n\nIPost administered to hearts was previously found to have an\nadvantage over IPC; the endogenous CYP2J3/11,12-EET system\nwas found to be upregulated by IPost, but not IPC, in the rat heart.\nWe proposed that upregulation of CYP2J3/11,12-EET during IPost\ninduces cardioprotection by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis\nand that multiple apoptotic signals, including changes in MMP\nand mPTP opening, mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage, caspase-\n3 levels, and the ratios of expression of protective kinases such\nas Bcl-2 and Bax, are involved in the process. Neonatal rat cardio-\nmyocytes were exposed to H/R or HPost alone; transfected with\npcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 for 48 h, then H/R; or treated with the CYP epox-\nygenase inhibitor MS-PPOH 10 min before HPost. As with HPost\nalone, pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 transfection attenuated cardiomyocyte\napoptosis to 68.4% of that with H/R. pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 transfection\nsignificantly decreased MMP levels and inhibited mPTP opening\nand mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage and cleaved caspase-3\n\n\n\nFig. 6. Effect of pcDNA3.1-CYP2J3 or MS-PPOH on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. To reveal MMP\nchange (A), cells were incubated with 10 lg/mL JC-1 for 20 min at 37 \ufffdC. Treatment as in Fig. 2. To reveal mPTP opening (B), cells were co-loaded for 15 min with 2 lM\ncalcein-AM and 4 mM CoCl2 at 37 \ufffdC. The rates of calcein-AM loading and exit were measured by fluorescence signal recording every 5 min by confocal microscopy. The\nrelative level of fluorescence was quantified by the relative ratio of red to green fluorescent intensity per cell.

Wang et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 360\u2013368 367\ninhibiting apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway. This apop-\ntosis-suppressive effect may have important clinical implications\nduring HPost.\n\nArachidonic acid (AA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid normally\nfound esterified to cell membrane glycerophospholipids, can be re-\nleased by phospholipases in response to ischemia [21]. Free AA is\nthen available for metabolism by prostaglandin H2 synthases, lip-\noxygenases, and CYP450 epoxygenases to generate numerous\nmetabolites, collectively termed eicosanoids [21]. Cardiac CYP\nepoxygenases metabolize AA to four regioisomeric EETs (5,6-;\n8,9-; 11,12-; and 14,15-EET), and CYP x-hydroxylases metabolize\nAA to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) [22]. The\nCYP450 pathway has recently been investigated in several animal\nmodels of I/R injury. Administration of EETs and overexpression\nof mouse CYP2J3 resulted in cardioprotection [23]. Similarly, two\nselective EET antagonists, 14,15-EEZE and 14,15-EEZE-PEG, and\nan EET synthesis inhibitor, MS-PPOH, blocked the cardioprotective\neffects of IPost in the canine heart at doses that had no effect on\nischemia when given alone [24]. In a recent study of CYP2J2 trans-\ngenic mice, the protective effect was observed in an isolated Lange-\nndorff mouse heart [25]. In addition, EET biosynthesis was\nenhanced in stenosed coronary arteries [26] and during cardiac I/\nR injury [27]. All of these data strongly suggest that EETs are in-\nvolved in cardioprotection, but the mechanisms by which EETs ini-\ntiate their actions are not clear.\n\nEETs prevented apoptosis in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes and\nin a mouse atrial cardiomyocyte cell line (HL-1) subjected to HR in-\njury [28]. A finding in a renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line\ndemonstrated that EETs inhibited apoptosis induced by serum\nwithdrawal and etoposide [29]. Exogenous EETs increased human\nendothelial cell survival and attenuated apoptosis [30]. CYP epox-\nygenases markedly attenuated apoptosis and prevented both TNF-\na activation of caspase-3 and TNF-a reduction of Bcl-2 expression\nin cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells [31]. All of these data\nsuggest that EETs are involved in cardioprotection by inhibition\nof apoptosis.\n\nWe aimed to investigate the effect of upregulating CYP2J3 or\nadministering a specific inhibitor of CYP2J3 (MS-PPOH) on neona-\ntal rat cardiomyocytes to explore whether the CYP2J3/11,12-EET\nsystem is involved in the cardioprotection of HPost by inhibiting\napoptosis. Endogenous CYP2J3/11,12-EET upregulated by HPost,\nbut not HPC, in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes in vitro was consistent\nwith our previous results in rat hearts in vivo [9]. Similar to HPost,\nCYP2J3 overexpression significantly increased neonatal rat cardio-\nmyocyte viability, as previously observed [29]. Moreover, similar\nto HPost, CYP2J3 overexpression significantly protected neonatal\nrat cardiomyocytes against H/R-induced apoptosis as evaluated\nby Hoechst staining and TUNEL analysis. Importantly, inhibition\nof CYP2J3 with MS-PPOH increased the apoptotic rate of HPost.\nTherefore, the CYP2J3/11,12-EET pathway is an important regula-\ntor of neonatal rat cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\n\nThe high energy demands of cardiac function are supplied by\nATP, produced mainly by mitochondria through oxidative phos-\nphorylation, glycolysis, and the Krebs cycle [32,33]. Ischemic\nevents can greatly alter mitochondrial function and thereby de-\ncrease cardiac efficiency. This damage ultimately contributes to\ncontractile dysfunction, mPTP opening, and cell death. mPTP for-\nmation may be the event that leads to irreversible changes in cel-\nlular function and cell death [34]. During the early minutes of\nreperfusion, IPost reduces oxidative stress and inhibits mPTP open-\ning, independent of altered oxidative phosphorylation or DWm\n[35]. Perfusion with the mPTP-opener atractyloside abolished im-\nproved the post-ischemic functional recovery observed in hearts\nwith CYP2J2 overexpression [36]. Moreover, UA-8, a synthetic\ncompound with both EET-mimetic and sEH-inhibitory properties,\nprovided significant cardioprotection against I/R injury by limiting\nmitochondrial dysfunction [37]. Our results demonstrated that\nsimilar to HPost, CYP2J3 overexpression significantly decreased\nMMP and mPTP opening as evaluated by JC-1 staining and calce-\nin-AM and CoCl2 co-loading analysis. Furthermore, MS-PPOH abol-\nished this effect; thus, CYP2J3/11,12-EET inhibited apoptosis by\ndecreasing MMP and mPTP opening.\n\nA diverse array of intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli regulates\nendothelial cell apoptosis by modulating the balance between\nthe pro-apoptotic caspases and various anti-apoptotic proteins\nsuch as Bcl-2. CYP epoxygenase overexpression significantly inhib-\nited caspase-3 activity, and the time-dependent downregulation of\nBcl-2 expression induced by TNF- a [36], which suggests that EETs\ninhibit the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins and maintain levels of\nanti-apoptotic proteins. Our results showed that, similar to HPost,\nCYP2J3 overexpression significantly inhibited mitochondrial\ncytochrome c leakage, ameliorated increased cleaved caspase-3\nexpression and the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax expression. Furthermore,\nMS-PPOH abolished this effect; thus, mitochondrial cytochrome c\nrelease, pro-apoptotic caspase-3 and apoptosis proteins such as\nBcl-2 and Bax are involved in the cardioprotection of CYP2J3/\n11,12-EET upregulation during HPost.\n\nIn addition, several papers have suggested that the EETs are po-\ntent activators of the sarc KATP channel [38,39]. One paper sug-\ngests that they may also act via the mito KATP channel [40]. In a\nmore recent study from this laboratory, Lu et al. [39] demonstrated\nthat the 11(S),12(R)-EET regioisomer activated the rat ventricular\nmyocyte sarc KATP channel. Seubert et al. showed that flavoprotein\nfluorescence, a marker of mito KATP channel activity [22], was sig-\nnificantly higher in cardiomyocytes obtained from CYP2J2 trans-\ngenic animals than in those from wild-type mice. Taken together,\n\n\n\n368 H.-X. Wang et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 360\u2013368\nthese results suggest that the beneficial effects of activating the\nCYP epoxygenase pathway in the heart are mediated, at least\npartly, via opening of the sarc and/or mito KATP channel. Whether\nKATP is involved in this cardioprotection effect of CYP2J3/11,12-\nEET during HPost should be further studied.\n\nIn conclusion, our study revealed that upregulation of CYP2J3/\n11,12-EET during HPost induced cardioprotection by inhibiting\napoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. This cardioprotection ef-\nfect appeared to involve decreased mPTP opening and attenuation\nof the H/R-mediated mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage and acti-\nvation of pro-apoptotic caspase-3 and ratio of expression of apopto-\ntic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bax. Increased 11,12-EET biosynthesis\nmay contribute to the survival of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The\napoptosis-suppressive effect of EETs may have important clinical\nimplications during HPost, and modulation of CYP2J3-mediated\n11,12-EET biosynthesis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy\nfor the clinical establishment of IPost.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foun-\ndation of the People\u2019s Republic of China (no. 30770874).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Murry CE, Jennings RB, Reimer KA.
