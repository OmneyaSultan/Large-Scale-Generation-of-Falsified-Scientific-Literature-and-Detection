Zyxin is an evolutionarily conserved protein that \nhas been implicated in the regulation of actin assembly and \nis mainly located at focal adhesions. However, the biological \nroles of Zyxin in cancer cells are incompletely understood. We \nanalyzed the functions of Zyxin in cell migration and the inva-\nsive potential of OSCC. Zyxin expression was examined using \neight OSCC cell lines with two different cell morphologies \n(6\u00a0epithelial\u00a0type\u00a0and\u00a02\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0type).\u00a0To\u00a0knockdown\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0\nexpression, OSCC cells were transfected with Zyxin siRNA \nand control siRNA. The cell lines were studied by western blot \nanalysis, immunocytochemical analysis and cell migration \nand invasion assay. Epithelial type OSCC cells showed a high \nlevel of E-cadherin expression and a low level of Zyxin expres-\nsion. N-cadherin as well as Zyxin were strongly expressed in \nfibroblastic\u00a0type\u00a0OSCC\u00a0cells.\u00a0Expression\u00a0levels\u00a0of\u00a0LPP\u00a0and\u00a0\nTRIP6,\u00a0members\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0human\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0family,\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0differ\u00a0\nbetween\u00a0epithelial\u00a0type\u00a0and\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0type.\u00a0Knockdown\u00a0of\u00a0\nZyxin\u00a0expression\u00a0by\u00a0siRNA\u00a0in\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0type\u00a0OSCC\u00a0cells\u00a0\nwas associated with cell morphological changes from spindle \n(fibroblastic)\u00a0to\u00a0polygonal\u00a0(epithelial)\u00a0shape\u00a0and\u00a0significantly\u00a0\ninhibited cell growth as well as cell migration and inva-\nsion.\u00a0Expression\u00a0levels\u00a0of\u00a0Rac1\u00a0and\u00a0Cdc42\u00a0were\u00a0weaker\u00a0in\u00a0\nZyxin\u00a0siRNA-treated\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0 type\u00a0OSCC\u00a0cells\u00a0 than\u00a0 in\u00a0\ncontrol siRNA-treated cells, but the expression of RhoA did \nnot\u00a0differ\u00a0significantly.\u00a0Treatment\u00a0of\u00a0fibroblastic\u00a0type\u00a0OSCC\u00a0\ncells with Rac1 inhibitor decreased the expression of Zyxin \nmRNA and protein.

Shinto et al\u00a0(37)\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0\nstable expression of the oncoprotein associated with scirrhous \ngastric cancer cells resulted in decreased Zyxin levels and a \ncorresponding increase in motility. Furthermore, Amsellem \net al\u00a0(38)\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0knockout\u00a0of\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0in\u00a0Ewing's\u00a0sarcoma\u00a0\ncells is associated with enhanced cell motility.

This finding was consistent with the \nresults\u00a0of\u00a0Pratt\u00a0et al\u00a0(40),\u00a0who\u00a0suggested\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0Ajuba/Zyxin\u00a0\nfamily of LIM proteins leads to activation of Rac during cell \nmigration. These results suggest that Zyxin is a potential \nEMT\u00a0marker\u00a0 and\u00a0 that\u00a0overexpression\u00a0of\u00a0Zyxin\u00a0promotes\u00a0\ncell growth and invasion via up-regulation of Rac1, CDC42 \nor both in OSCC cells. Although we have not yet found an \ninhibitor of CDC42, EHT1864 decreased Zyxin mRNA and \n\nprotein in HOC-313. Our results suggest a mechanism by \nwhich reduced Zyxin expression might contribute to tumor \nregression by affecting cytoarchitecture and motility.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis\u00a0 study\u00a0 was\u00a0 supported\u00a0 by\u00a0 JSPS\u00a0 KAKENHI\u00a0 Grant\u00a0\nno.\u00a022592249\u00a0(to\u00a0K.N.)\u00a0and\u00a0Grant-in-Aid\u00a0for\u00a0Young\u00a0Scientists\u00a0\n(B)\u00a023792399\u00a0(to\u00a0E.S.).\n\nReferences\n\n\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0 Pereira\u00a0MC,\u00a0 Oliveira\u00a0 DT,\u00a0 Landman\u00a0 G\u00a0 and\u00a0 Kowalski\u00a0 LP:\u00a0\nHistologic subtypes of oral squamous cell carcinoma: prog-\nnostic relevance.
