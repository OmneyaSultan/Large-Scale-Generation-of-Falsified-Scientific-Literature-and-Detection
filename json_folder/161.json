In an in vivo exper-\niment, MSU crystals were administered into subcutaneous air pouches created in mice, following peritoneal injection of ethanol diluted\nwith PBS. MSU crystals (0.75 mg/ml) stimulated the secretion of TNF-a, IL-8, and IL-1b from THP1 cells, while ethanol at a concen-\ntration of 0.8% reduced those increases by 1.79-, 1.63-, and 1.75-fold, respectively. In vitro, MSU crystals (0.75 mg/ml) significantly\nincreased the expression of phosphorylated JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 proteins in THP1 cells, while ethanol at a concentration of 0.8%\nreduced those increased expressions by 1.28-, 1.14-, and 1.68-fold, respectively. In addition, MSU crystals (0.75 mg/ml) significantly\nincreased the expression of phosphorylated NF-jB protein in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions and decreased the expression of IjBa\nin the cytosolic fraction. Ethanol at a concentration of 0.8% reduced the MSU-increased expression of phosphorylated NF-jB in the\nnuclear and cytosolic fractions by 1.25- and 1.27-fold, respectively, while it also reduced the MSU-decreased expression of IjBa in\nthe cytosolic fraction by 1.12-fold. In vivo, MSU crystals increased the number of leukocytes, as well as the concentrations of KC,\nMIP1a, and IL-6 in pouch fluids, while ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) considerably inhibited the MSU crystal-induced inflammation.\nThese results strongly suggest that ethanol suppresses the secretion of inflammatory cytokines induced by MSU crystals via a pathway\nincluding MAPK (p38, JNK, and ERK1/2, especially p38) and NF-jB.\n\ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nHyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater\nthan 420 lmol/L and indicates that total body urate is\nincreased.

During attacks of acute\narthritis, MSU crystals are found in leukocytes in synovial\nfluids, indicating that they are involved with induction of\nthose attacks. In previous studies [1,2], MSU crystals were\ndemonstrated to stimulate synovial cells, monocytes\u2013mac-\nrophages, and neutrophils to produce a variety of different\ncytokines including TNF-a, IL-8, IL-1b, IL-6, and mono-\ncyte chemotactic factor, which induce acute inflammation.\n\nIt is well known that ingestion of a large amount of alco-\nholic beverages containing ethanol causes hyperuricemia\nand gouty arthritis. Ethanol enhances adenine nucleotide\ndegradation that leads to an increased production of uric\nacid [3\u20135], while it also increases the blood concentration\nof lactic acid, which inhibits the urinary excretion of uric\n\nmailto:tetsuya@hyo-med.ac.jp\n\n\nT. Inokuchi et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 198\u2013204 199\nacid [6]. These actions of ethanol raise the plasma concen-\ntration of urate, leading to gouty attack. Accordingly,\npatients with gout are recommended to refrain from inges-\ntion of large amounts of alcoholic beverages.\n\nOur experience has shown that patients with gout rarely\nexperience gouty arthritis at the time of drinking, whereas\nthey frequently experience a gouty attack due to hyperuri-\ncemia-induced crystal formation and deposition in the\njoints early the next morning during sleep after ingesting\na large amount of alcoholic beverages the previous evening.\nSeveral reasons can be considered for why patients with\ngout rarely experience gouty arthritis when consuming\nalcohol. First, the associated increase in plasma concentra-\ntion of urate is not enough to cause gouty arthritis. Second,\ningested ethanol affects the sensory area of the central ner-\nvous system, leading to a decrease in the sense of pain.\nThird, ethanol may suppress inflammation due to urate\ncrystal deposition via cytokine regulation. In the present\nstudy, we focused on the third reason, because a previous\nstudy demonstrated that excessive ethanol consumption\ndepresses the immune system, thus increasing the suscepti-\nbility to infection [7], and other studies have reported that\nethanol suppressed the immune responses of several\nimmune cell types, including monocytes, macrophage,\nT lymphocytes, and neutrophils [8\u201312]. Recently, it was\ndemonstrated that ethanol inhibits LPS-induced accumula-\ntion of leukocytes [13], which suggests that it may also inhi-\nbit arthritis induced by MSU crystals. Therefore, we\nexamined the effects of ethanol on MSU crystal-induced\ninflammation in vitro as well as in vivo in order to elucidate\nthe mechanisms involved.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Reagents\n\nUric acid was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals\nLtd. (Osaka, Japan) and MSU crystals were produced by\na method previously described [14]. In brief, after treating\nuric acid for 2 h at 200 \ufffdC, a uric acid solution (0.03 M,\npH 7.5) was prepared by dissolution of equimolar quanti-\nties of uric acid and sodium hydroxide. Sodium chloride\n(0.1 M final concentration) was added to accelerate the for-\nmation of triclinic MSU crystallization. Endotoxin was not\ndetected in 10 mg MSU crystals/ml in PBS (<0.8 endotoxin\npg/ml by a limulus amoebocyte assay.\n\n2.2. Cell culture conditions\n\nTHP1 cells from a human monocyte cell line, were\ngrown in RPMI 1640 containing penicillin\u2013streptomycin\nand 20% fetal cow serum (FBS) at 37 \ufffdC under 5% CO2/\n95% air. Prior to the experiments, cells (0.5 \ufffd 106 cells)\nwere plated in flat-bottomed 24-well plates (Iwaki Glass,\nTokyo, Japan) in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing penicil-\nlin\u2013streptomycin and 20% fetal cow serum, then pretreated\nfor differentiation with 10 nM phorbol 12-myrisate 13-ace-\n\nRE\nTR\n\nA\n\ntate (PMA) for 24 h. Thereafter, the culture medium was\naspirated and 0.5 ml of fresh medium containing penicil-\nlin\u2013streptomycin and 1% fetal cow serum was added, with\nor without MSU crystals (0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 mg/ml) in the\npresence or absence of ethanol (0%, 0.4%, or 0.8% concen-\ntration). Differentiated cells cultured with medium contain-\ning 20% fetal cow serum secreted considerable amounts of\ncytokines, while the increase in MSU crystals-induced cyto-\nkine secretion was slight, as compared with the baseline\nvalues. On the other hand, those cells cultured with 1%\nfetal cow serum secreted negligible amounts of cytokines,\nwhereas the increase in MSU crystal-induced cytokine\nsecretion was significant. Therefore, 1% fetal cow serum\nwas used instead of 20% fetal cow serum in the present\nstudy. Twelve hours after the addition of fresh culture med-\nium, the medium was aspirated to measure the secretion of\ncytokines. In addition, to investigate the expression of\nphosphorylated p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 proteins, 1 h after\nthe addition of fresh medium, the medium was removed\nand THP1 cells were washed with PBS. The cells were then\ndissolved with RIPA buffer consisting of PBS, 1% Nonidet\nP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS containing\n100 lg of PMSF/ml RIPA, 30 ll of aprotinin (Sigma, St.\nLouis, MO, USA)/ml RIPA, and 1 lmol sodium orthovan-\nadate/ml of RIPA, after which the expression of the pro-\nteins was determined.\n\n2.3. Cytokines\n\nHuman and mouse IL-8 levels were measured using\nHuman IL-8 ELISA kit (BMI Medical & Biological Labo-\nratories Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan). Human IL-1b, TNF-a,\nand IL-6 levels and those levels of mouse IL-1b, IL-6, KC,\nand MIP1a were determined with commercially available\nELISA kits (human: BioSource International, Inc., CA,\nUSA, mouse: R&D Systems Minneapolis, MN, USA).\n\n2.4. Immunoblotting of phosphorylated p38, JNK, and ERK\n\nproteins\n\nRIPA containing 5 lg of protein from the dissolved cells\nwas applied to gels and electrophoresis was performed,\nafter which immunoblotting was performed as described\npreviously [15]. In brief, phosphorylated p38, JNK, and\nERK1/2 proteins together with GAPDH protein as a con-\ntrol were each transferred electrophoretically from a 10%\nSDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel to a PVDF membrane at 1 mA/\ncm2 for 90 min, using Trans Blot SD (Bio-Rad Laborato-\nries, Hercules, CA, USA). After incubation with Block\nAce (Dainippon Pharmaceuticals, Osaka) overnight at\n4 \ufffdC, the PVDF membrane was washed with 50 mM\nTris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (TBS) and incubated over-\nnight at room temperature in a dilution of anti-phospho-\nSPARK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) (Cell Signaling Technology\nInc., MA, USA), phospho-p44/42 map kinase (Thr202/\nTyr204) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), p38 mitogen-\nactivated protein kinase (MAPK) (pT180/pY182)\n\nCT\nED\n\n\n\nTable 1\nEffects of ethanol on MSU-increased secretion of TNF-a (pg/ml) from\nTHP1 cells\n\n0% Ethanol 0.4% Ethanol 0.8% Ethanol\n\n0.75 mg/ml MSU 1732 \u00b1 78 1148 \u00b1 68** 965 \u00b1 51**\n\n0.5 mg/ml MSU 1213 \u00b1 78 787 \u00b1 58** 577 \u00b1 32**\n\n0.25 mg/ml MSU 633 \u00b1 47 520 \u00b1 82** 306 \u00b1 37**\n\n0 mg/ml MSU ND ND ND\n\nValues are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD (number of samples = 5).

The PVDF membrane was then washed\nthree times for 10 min each, with TBS and incubated with\na 1:500 dilution of a secondary antibody (biotinylated anti-\nrabbit IgG, anti-mouse IgG; or anti-goat antibody) for 3 h\nat room temperature. Next, the PVDF membrane was\nwashed 4 times with TBS and incubated with avidin\u2013biotin\ncomplex (Vectastain ABC Elite kit; Vector Laboratories,\nCA, USA). Finally, the phosphorylated p38, JNK, and\nERK1/2 proteins along with the GAPDH protein were\nvisualized by incubation with 0.01% H2O2 in TBS contain-\ning 0.05% diaminobenzidine.\n\n2.5. Preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and\n\nimmunoblotting of phosphorylated NF-jB and\nnonphosphorylated IjBa\n\nDifferentiated THP1 cells were incubated with fresh\nmedium containing penicillin\u2013streptomycin and 1% fetal\ncow serum, with or without MSU crystals (0.75 mg/ml)\nin the presence or absence of 0.8% ethanol at 37 \ufffdC for\n1 h, then nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared\nusing an NE-PER kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). There-\nafter, using 5 lg protein of each extract, western blot anal-\nyses of phosphorylated NF-jB and nonphosphorylated\nIjBa expressions were performed as described above, using\nphospho-NF-jB p65 (Ser 536) antibody (Cell Signaling\nTechnology Inc.) and IjBa/MAD-3 (BD Transduction\nLaboratories, CA, USA). As controls for nuclear and cyto-\nplasmic proteins, p44/p42 and b-actin, respectively, were\nused.\n\n2.6. Mice\n\nSpecific pathogen-free female C57BL/6 mice (6\u20138 week\nold) were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan).\n\n2.7. Treatment of mice\n\nIt is considered better to inject MSU crystals into mouse\njoints to investigate MSU crystal-induced arthritis. How-\never, it is very difficult to inject MSU crystals into mouse\njoints and aspirate joint fluids after such an injection.\nTherefore, we performed the present in vivo experiment\nusing a subcutaneous air pouch, which is similar to a joint\nin terms of MSU crystal-induced inflammation [16,17].\n\nSubcutaneous air pouches were created in the backs of\nthe mice according to a method previously described [16].\nThree milliliters of air was injected into the subcutaneous\ntissue, followed by a second injection of 5 ml of air after\n3 days. Seven days after the first injection, a preparation\nof MSU crystals (3 mg in a volume of sterile PBS) was\ninjected into the air pouches 15 min after intraperitoneal\ninjection of sterile PBS containing ethanol (5 ml/kg body\nweight) or sterile PBS alone. As a control, the same volume\n\nRE\nTR\nof sterile PBS was injected into the air pouches 15 min after\nintraperitoneal injection of sterile PBS. Eight hours later,\nthe pouch fluid was harvested by injecting 3 ml of PBS.\nThe infiltrating cells were then counted using a hemocy-\ntometer and stained with Wright\u2013Giemsa solution to per-\nform a differential count of leukocytes. In addition, the\npouch fluid sample was centrifuged at 1500g for 10 min\nand the supernatant was obtained.\n\n2.8. Statistical analysis\n\nValues are expressed as the median (range) or\nmean \u00b1 SD, and significant differences between the vari-\nables were analyzed using a nonparametric method or\nANOVA. Significance was defined as P < 0.05.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. In vitro data\n\nMSU crystals stimulated the secretion of TNF-a from\nTHP1 cells, which were enhanced by increases in MSU\ncrystal concentration in medium in a range of 0.25\u2013\n0.75 mg/ml (Table 1). On the other hand, ethanol at con-\ncentrations of 0.4% and 0.8% reduced the secretion of\nTNF-a induced by 0.75 mg/ml MSU crystals by 1.51-fold\n(P < 0.01) and 1.79-fold (P < 0.01), respectively (Table 1).\n\nMSU crystals also stimulated the secretion of IL-8 from\nTHP1 cells, which was enhanced by increases in MSU crys-\ntal concentration in medium in a range of 0.25 to 0.75 mg/ml\n(Table 2). On the other hand, ethanol at concentrations of\n0.4% and 0.8% reduced the secretion of IL-8 induced by\n0.75 mg/ml of MSU crystals by 1.52-fold (P < 0.01) and\n1.63-fold (P < 0.01), respectively, that induced by 0.5 mg/ml\nof MSU crystals by 1.47-fold (P < 0.01) and 1.92-fold\n(P < 0.01), respectively, and that induced by 0.25 mg/ml\nof MSU crystals by 1.21-fold (P < 0.01) and 1.89-fold\n(P < 0.01), respectively (Table 2).\n\nWe also noted that MSU crystals stimulated the secre-\ntion of IL-1b from THP1 cells, which was enhanced by\nincreases in MSU crystal concentration in medium in a\nrange of 0.25\u20130.75 mg/ml (Table 3). On the other hand,\nethanol at concentrations of 0.4% and 0.8% reduced the\nsecretion of IL-1b induced by 0.75 mg/ml of MSU crystals\nby 1.49-fold (P < 0.01) and 1.75-fold (P < 0.01), respec-\n\nCT\nED\n\n\n\nP38\n\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\n\nJNK\n\nERK1/2\n\nGAPDH\n\nFig. 1.

Our results showed that KC, MIP1a, IL-1b, and IL-\n6 were increased, together with increases in the numbers of\nleukocytes and neutrophils (Table 4). On the other hand,\nethanol considerably reduced the MSU crystal-induced\ninflammation by reducing the secretion of KC, MIP1a,\nIL-1b, and IL-6, as well as numbers of leukocytes and neu-\ntrophils by 2.92-fold (P < 0.01), 4.85-fold (P < 0.01), 17.9-\nfold (P < 0.05), 18.6-fold (P < 0.05), 4.29-fold (P < 0.05),\nand 5.5-fold (P < 0.05), respectively (Table 4).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nA number of studies have reported that ethanol inhib-\nited LPS-induced increases in inflammatory-cytokine pro-\nduction in macrophage\u2013monocyte lineage cells [18\u201321],\nwhich was shown to occur via decreases in mitogen-acti-\nvated protein kinase (MAPK) [8,18\u201323]. In addition, it\nwas reported that ethanol has an effect on TLR4, probably\nby changing the cell membrane, and inhibits LPS-induced\np38 phosphorylation, leading to a reduction in LPS-\ninduced secretion of IL-8 and TNF-a [23]. These findings\nsuggest that ethanol reduces LPS-induced inflammation.\n\nRecently, it was reported that MSU crystals activated\ncaspase-1 [16,24] and also processed the inactive form of\nIL-1b to the active form via the NACHT-LRR-PYD-con-\ntaining protein-3 inflammasome [24]. In addition, it was\ndemonstrated that MSU crystals stimulated the secretion\nof cytokines containing IL-1b and TNF-a from monocytes\nvia TLR2 and TLR4 [25], while another study found that\nMSU stimulated the secretion of IL-1b from resident cells\nand the secreted IL-1b stimulated an MyD88-dependent\namplification of proinflammatory responses via the IL-1b\nreceptor (IL-1 R) on non-bone marrow-derived cells, sug-\ngesting that the secretion of IL-1b from resident cells\n\nRE\nTR\ninduced by MSU crystals plays an important role in gouty\nattack [26]. These findings indicate that IL-1b produced by\nMSU crystal-induced activation of capase-1 may cause\nproinflammatory response via a MyD88-dependent signal\npathway including MAPK and NF-jB. They also suggest\nthat ethanol inhibits MSU-induced inflammation. Accord-\ningly, we conducted the present study to determine whether\nethanol inhibits the MSU crystal-induced secretion of\ninflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo.\n\nIn the present in vitro study, MSU crystals stimulated\nthe secretion of IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-1b from THP1 cells,\nwhile ethanol inhibited the MSU-induced secretion of these\ncytokines (Tables 1\u20133). A previous study demonstrated\nthat MSU crystals-induced the activation of JNK,\nERK1/2, and p38 in THP1 cells, and also increased their\nsecretion of IL-8 [27]. Further, a recent more study showed\nthat MSU crystals promoted MSK1/2, ERK1/2, and IjBa\nphosphorylation as well as NF-jB and AP-1 translocation\nin the murine macrophage cell line B10R [28]. Our findings\nalso indicate that MSU crystals stimulate IL-8 secretion\nfrom THP1 cells together with increased phosphorylation\nof ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, they\nincreased the levels of phosphorylated NF-jB in the cyto-\nsolic and nuclear fractions and decreased IjBa in the cyto-\nsolic fraction (Figs. 3 and 4). Therefore, the present results\n\nCT\nED\n\n\n\n(1) (2) (3)\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nd\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\nR\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nd\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nCytosolic\np-NF\u03baB\n\nNuclear \nP-NF\u03baB\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nd\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n\n1.0\n\n0.5Cytosolic I\u03baB\n\nFig. 4.

Inokuchi et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 198\u2013204 203\nshowed that MSU crystals produce proinflammatory cyto-\nkines via a pathway including MAPK and NF-jB in THP1\ncells, as described above [27,28]. Further, in the present\nexperiments, ethanol slightly inhibited the MSU crystal-\ninduced increases in phosphorylated ERK1/2 and JNK,\nwhile it considerably inhibited the increase in phosphory-\nlated p38. In addition, ethanol inhibited the MSU crys-\ntal-induced increase in phosphorylated NF-jB in the\ncytosolic and nuclear fractions as well as MSU crystal-\ninduced decrease in IjBa in the cytosolic fraction. Ethanol\nalso inhibited the secretion of IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-1b in\nTHP1 cells induced by MSU crystals. Thus, we concluded\nthat ethanol decreases the MSU-induced secretion of IL-8,\nTNF-a, and IL-1b via pathways, including MAPK (p38,\nJNK, and ERK1/2, especially p38) and NF-jB.\n\nArbabi et al. reported that ethanol inhibited LPS-\ninduced p38 phosphorylation in human mononuclear cells\n[8], whereas Oak et al. showed that ethanol did not have an\neffect on LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation [29]. Those\ncontrasting results may be related to the timing differences\nbetween the administration of ethanol and TLR ligand uti-\nlized in their experiments, and/or differences in ethanol\nconcentration in the media. In the former study, ethanol\nranging from 46 to 174 mM was added to culture media\nthat included monocytes at 1 h before the addition of\nLPS, while in the latter, ethanol at 25 mM and LPS were\n\nRE\nTR\n\nA\n\nadministered at the same time. In the present study, we\nadded ethanol at 46\u2013174 mM to culture media that\nincluded THP1 cells at 1 h before the addition of MSU\ncrystals, since patients with gout typically have a gouty\nattack following the ingestion of alcoholic beverages. Our\nresults are similar to those of Arbabi et al. [8], though we\nused THP1 cells instead of monocytes.\n\nOak et al. also demonstrated that ethanol enhanced\nincreases in phosphorylated ERK1/2 and JNK proteins,\nwhereas it did not have an effect on phosphorylated p38\nprotein in monocytes in the presence of TLR2 and TLR4\nligands (PGN and LPS) [29]. Further, they demonstrated\nthat ethanol inhibited the increase in phosphorylated\nERK1/2 proteins, but did not have an effect on phosphor-\nylated JNK protein in monocytes in the presence of a\nTLR4 ligand (LPS) alone [29]. In contrast, in the present\nstudy, ethanol slightly inhibited MSU crystal-induced\nincreases in phosphorylated ERK1/2 and JNK proteins,\nwhile it considerably inhibited the increase in phosphory-\nlated p38 protein in THP1 cells. The differences between\nthese results may be ascribable to the different ligands used.\n\nIn our in vivo experiment, MSU crystals caused neutro-\nphil accumulation and the secretion of KC, IL-6, IL-1b,\nand MIP1a when injected into subcutaneous air pouches\nin mice. However, TNF-a secretion from THP1 cells\ninduced by administration of the MSU crystals was not\ndetected in the pouches 8 h after injection. In a previous\nrabbit study, the secretion of TNF-a in joints increased\nand peaked at 2 h after intra-articular administration of\nMSU crystals, and then rapidly decreased until only small\namounts of TNF-a were detected after 4 h [30]. Together,\nthese results suggest that TNF-a is abruptly secreted imme-\ndiately after the administration of MSU crystals for a per-\niod of a few hours. However, since intra-articular\nadministration of MSU crystals together with the anti-\nTNF-a antibody reduced the number of inflammatory cells\nin the rabbit joints, as compared with administration of\nMSU crystals alone, it was suggested that TNF-a plays a\nrole in MSU crystal-induced arthritis. In addition, intra-\narticular administration of MSU crystals together with\nthe anti-IL-8 antibody or IL-1b receptor antagonist also\nreduced the number of inflammatory cells, as compared\nwith administration of MSU crystals alone. Those results\nalso suggest that IL-8 and IL-1b play roles in MSU crys-\ntal-induced arthritis. Therefore, even though TNF-a was\nnot detected in our in vivo experiment, it may enhance\nMSU crystal-induced inflammation together with other\ncytokines (KC, IL-6, IL-1b, and MIP1a).\n\nA recent study of IL-1b receptor-defective type mice\nfound that inflammatory reactions, including neutrophil\naccumulation, due to MSU were markedly decreased, as\ncompared with wild type mice, indicating that IL-1b is an\nimportant factor in gouty arthritis and that MyD88-depen-\ndent IL-1b receptor signaling is essential for that condition\n[26]. Since KC and MIP1a are also neutrophil chemoat-\ntractants, in addition to IL-1b, the present results suggest\nthat ethanol inhibited the MSU crystal-induced secretion\n\nCT\nED\n\n\n\n204 T.

They also show that though\nthe effect is short-lived, the anti-inflammatory action of\nethanol may retard the onset of ethanol-induced gouty\narthritis despite an ethanol-induced increase in the serum\nconcentration of urate.\n\nNevertheless, additional examinations are needed to elu-\ncidate the acute effects of ethanol on gouty inflammation.\nA\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Guerne PA, Terkeltaub R, Zuraw B, Lotz M.
