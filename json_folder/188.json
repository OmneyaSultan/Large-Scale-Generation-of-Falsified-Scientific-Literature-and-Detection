Despite the rapid progress in elucidating the SL biosynthetic pathway, the perception and signalling mechanisms\nof SL remain poorly understood. Here we show that DWARF 53 (D53) acts as a repressor of SL signalling and that SLs\ninduce its degradation.We find that the rice (Oryza sativa) d53mutant,which produces an exaggerated numberof tillers\ncompared to wild-type plants, is caused by a gain-of-function mutation and is insensitive to exogenous SL treatment.\nTheD53 gene product shares predicted featureswith the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complexwith the a/b\nhydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling com-\nponents potentially responsible for SL perception.Wedemonstrate that, in aD14- andD3-dependentmanner, SLs induce\nD53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth. Our combined genetic\nand biochemical data reveal that D53 acts as a repressor of the SL signalling pathway, whose hormone-induced degra-\ndation represents a key molecular link between SL perception and responses.\n\nShoot branching (tillering in crops) is a major determinant of plant\narchitecture and crop yield, which is under the integrated control of\nhormonal, developmental and environmental factors1\u20133. Although the\nexistence of a root-derived transmissible shoot-repressing signal was\nproposed more than 70 years ago4, the identity of this signal(s) has\nremained elusive. Recent studies with branching mutants in several\nplant species have demonstrated that SLs, a specific group of terpenoid\nlactones, are the long-sought branching-repressing hormones, whose\nfunction are highly conserved in both monocots and dicots5,6. In addi-\ntion to repressing shoot branching, SLs also have a role in regulating\nroot growth, leaf senescence and flower development7. SLs also act as\nexogenous signals to promote the symbiosis between land plants and\narbuscularmycorrhizal fungi8 and stimulate the germination of the para-\nsitic weeds Striga and Orobanche, which are serious agricultural pests\nin many parts of the world9.\nPrevious studies have shown that DWARF 3 (D3), D10, D14 (also\n\nknown as HIGH-TILLERING DWARF 2, HTD2 and D88), D17 (also\nknown asHTD1) andD27 in rice10\u201314,MOREAXILLARYGROWTH1\n(MAX1),MAX2,MAX3 andMAX4 in Arabidopsis15\u201317, RAMOSUS 1\n(RMS1), RMS4 and RMS5 in pea18 and DECREASED APICAL\nDOMINANCE 1 (DAD1),DAD2 andDAD3 in petunia7,19 are involved\nin either thebiosynthesis or signallingof SLs.Among these genes,MAX3/\nRMS5/D17/DAD3,MAX4/RMS1/D10/DAD1,MAX1 inArabidopsis and\nD27 in rice encode the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7 (CCD7),\nCCD8, CYP711A1 (a cytochrome P450) and a novel b-carotene isomer-\nase, respectively, and are involved in the sequential cleavage ofb-carotene\nand synthesis of SLs20. By contrast,MAX2/RMS4/D3 andD14/DAD2,\nwhich encode an F-box protein and a protein of the a/b-hydrolase\nsuperfamily, respectively, probably have a role in SL signalling12,19,21.\n\nThe structural similarity between MAX2/RMS4/D3 proteins with the\nauxin receptor TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1)22,23\n\nand jasmonate receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1)24,\nandD14/DAD2 proteins with the gibberellin receptor GIBBERELLIN\nINSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID1)25, has sparked the speculation that\nboth MAX2/RMS4/D3 and D14/DAD2 could be candidates for the\nSL receptors26 and that binding and hydrolysis of SLs by D14/DAD2\n(refs 19, 27, 28)might be required for triggering proteasome-mediated\ndegradation of an unknown repressor by the Skp1\u2013Cullin\u2013F-box-\ncontaining (SCF)MAX2 complex29,30. However, the identity of such a\nrepressor and its regulatorymechanisms inSL signallinghave remained\nunknown.\nIn this study,we identified a gain-of-function ricemutant,d53, which\n\ndisplays a SL-insensitive and increased-tillering phenotype.Map-based\ncloning revealed thatD53 encodes a protein sharing predicted features\nwith the class IClpATPase proteins and that it can forma complexwith\nthe a/b hydrolase protein D14 and the F-box protein D3. We show\nthat SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome\u2013ubiquitin path-\nway in a D14- and D3-dependent manner. Our studies establish D53\nas a repressor of the SL signalling pathway, whose hormone-induced\ndegradation is essential for SL signalling.\n\nd53 is a rice SL-insensitive mutant\nPrevious studies have identified several ricemutants defective inSLbio-\nsynthesis or signalling10\u201314. Because of their highly branched and dwarf\nphenotype, these mutants were termed \u2018d mutants\u2019, such as d3, d10,\nd14, d17 and d27. The rice d53mutant31 also displayed reduced height\nand increased tillering, as well as thinner stem and shorter crown root,\ncompared to thewild-type strain (Fig. 1a, b andExtendedDataFig. 1a, b).\n\n1National Key Laboratory for CropGenetics andGermplasmEnhancement, JiangsuPlant Gene EngineeringResearchCenter, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China. 2National Key Facility\nfor Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China. 3Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington,\nSeattle,Washington98195,USA. 4HowardHughesMedical Institute, Box357280,University ofWashington, Seattle,Washington98195,USA. 5National Centre for PlantGeneResearch (Beijing), Institute of\nGenetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1-2 Beichen West Road, Beijing 100101, China. 6Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi,\nBunkyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.\n\n4 0 6 | N A T U R E | V O L 5 0 4 | 1 9 / 2 6 D E C E M B E R 2 0 1 3\n\nMacmillan Publishers Limited.

Histological analysis revealed that the sizes of vascular\nbundles and parenchyma cells in internodes were largely comparable\nbetween d53 and wild-type plants, implying that the shortening and\nthinning of the d53 stem were mainly caused by a reduction in cell\nnumber (Extended Data Fig. 1e\u2013h). The phenotypes of F1 heterozyg-\nous plantswere intermediate between the homozygous parental plants\n(ExtendedData Fig. 2a\u2013g). Genetic analyses of anF2 population derived\nfrom a cross of d53 and thewild-type parent (Norin 8) showed that the\nnormal, intermediate and dwarf plants segregated as 1:2:1 (33:58:28,\nx25 0.09, P. 0.05), indicating that the d53 mutation behaved in a\nsemi-dominant manner (Extended Data Fig. 2h).\nThe phenotypic similarity between d53 and the previously reported\n\nrice dmutants prompted us to examine whether d53 is defective in SL-\nmediated inhibition of axillary bud outgrowth. Quantitative PCRwith\nreverse transcription (qRT\u2013PCR) analysis showed that expression of\nD10 (encoding CCD8) was similarly upregulated in d53 (Fig. 1d) as in\nother d mutants, owing to feedback regulation in the SL pathway11.\nIn addition, expression of an inhibitor of axillary bud outgrowth,\nFINE CULM 1 (FC1)32, which is orthologous to the maize TEOSINTE\nBRANCHED1 (TB1)33 and the Arabidopsis BRANCHED 1 (BRC1)34,\nwas also similarly downregulated in the d53, d14 and d27 mutants\n(Fig. 1d), suggesting that D53 is probably involved in SL biosynthesis\n\nor signalling.Moreover, exogenous application of a SL analogue,GR24,\neffectively inhibited the outgrowth axillary buds of d27, but not d14 or\nd53 (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013c). Further, measurement of\nSLs produced in the root exudates showed that d53 accumulatedmark-\nedly higher levels of 29-epi-5-deoxystrigol (epi-5DS), a native SL of rice,\nthan the wild-type cultivar Norin 8 (Fig. 1f). These results indicate that\nd53 is a SL-insensitive mutant.\n\nD53 acts as a repressor of SL signalling\nD53was previously mapped to the terminal region of the short arm of\nrice chromosome 11 (ref. 35). To decipher themolecular defect in d53,\nwe isolatedD53 by a map-based cloning approach. Using an F2 popu-\nlation of , 12,000 plants generated from the cross between Ketan\nNangka and the mutant, we further delimited the D53 locus to a 34-\nkilobase DNA region on the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)\nclone OSJNBa0032J07, which contains three putative genes (Fig. 2a).\nSequence analysis revealed a single-nucleotide substitution and 15-\nnucleotide deletion in the third exon of LOC_Os11g01330 in d53,\nwhich resulted in an amino acid substitution (R812T) and deletion\nof five amino acids (813GKTGI817) (Fig. 2b).

The severity of tillering phenotype in these transgenic plants\nwas correlatedwith the expression level of the transgene. Notably, over-\nexpression of the wild-type D53 gene also caused a moderate increase\nin tillering, compared to the vector control plants (Fig. 2c\u2013e). These\nobservations suggested that the D53 protein acts as a repressor in the\nSL-mediated branching-inhibition pathway and that the dominant til-\nlering phenotype of the d53mutant was most likely caused by a gain-\nof-function mutation in d53. To further confirm this, we generated\nD53 knockdown transgenic plants using an RNA interference (RNAi)\napproach. As expected, reducingD53 expression in a d53 background\nmarkedly reduced the tiller number (Extended Data Fig. 3d, e). Taken\ntogether, these data support the proposition that the d53 mutation\nenhances D53 activity in repressing SL signalling.\nD53 is predicted to encode a protein of 1,131 amino acids. ABLAST\n\nsearch identified a closely related homologue of D53 (designatedD53-\nlike, LOC_Os12g01360) with 96.6% amino acid sequence identity in\nthe rice genome. Further, D53-like proteins were found in other mono-\ncots and dicots, but not in lower plants, animals or microbes, indicating\nthat theD53-like clade is specific to higher plants (ExtendedData Fig. 4).\nSequence analysis by the HHpred structure prediction server revealed\nthat D53 shares a similar secondary structure composition, despite low\nprimary sequencehomology, toproteins of the class IClpATPase family,\nwhich are characterizedbyanN-terminal domain, aD1ATPasedomain,\nan M domain and a D2 ATPase domain36. Notably, the D2 domain of\nD53 contains a highly conserved linear sequence, Phe-Asp-Leu-Asn-\nLeu, which closely matches the ethylene-responsive element binding\nfactor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR)motif (Extended Data\nFig. 5),which is known to interactwith theTOPLESS family of proteins\nand is involved in transcriptional repression37.\n\nqPCRanalysis revealed thatD53waswidely expressed in the examined\nrice tissues (Fig. 2f ). A D53-promoter-driven GUS (b-glucuronidase)\nreporter gene (pD53::GUS) assay showed thatGUS stainingwasobserved\nin the vasculature in roots, shoots, leaves, leaf sheaths, nodes, internodes\nand young panicles, preferentially in the parenchyma cells surrounding\nthe xylem (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013h). Moreover, D53 expression was\nupregulated by GR24 treatment in wild-type plants, but downregu-\nlated in six dmutants, suggesting that expression ofD53 is regulated by\nSLsignalling (Fig. 2g, h).TheD53\u2013green fluorescentprotein (GFP) fusion\nprotein is exclusively localized to the nucleus in rice protoplasts and the\npAct1::D53-GFP transgenic root cells (Extended Data Fig. 6i\u2013p).\n\nd\n\n15% input\n\n\u2013 +\n\nGST pull-down\n\nGST\u2013D3\u2013OSK1\u2013 + \u2013 +\n\nGST+ \u2013 + \u2013\n\nGR24\u2013 \u2013 + +\n\nAnti-D14\n34\n\n26\n\nc\n\nGST\u2013D14\n\npull-down\n\n5% input\n\nMBP\u2013D3\u2013 +\u2013 +\nMBP+ \u2013+ \u2013\n\nGR24\u2013 \u2013+ +\n\n130\n\n130\n\n55\n\n55\n\nAnti-MBP\n\nb CY eYFP DAPI BF Merged\n\n\u2013\nG\n\nR\n2\n4\n\n+\nG\n\nR\n2\n4\n\nNY\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nD14\n\nD53\n\nD14 D53\n\nD14 D53\n\na +GR24\u2013GR24\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nD53\n\nd53\n\nD53\n\nAD\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nD14\n\nD14\n\nD14\n\nBD\n\n\u2013LT \u2013LTHA\n+X-\u03b1-gal\n\n\u2013LT \u2013LTHA\n+X-\u03b1-gal\n\nkDa\n\n*\n\n*\n\nkDa\n\nFigure 3 | GR24 promotes the D53\u2013D14 and D14\u2013D3 interaction. a, Y2H\nassay showing that D53 and d53 interact with D14 in the presence of GR24.\nYeast transformants were spotted on the control medium (SD2Leu/2Trp\n(2LT)) and selective medium (SD 2Leu/2Trp/2His/2Ade (2LTHA) plus\nX-a-gal).

A\nyeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay showed that both D53 and d53 could\nphysically interactwithD14 in the presence ofGR24 (Fig. 3a).Domain\ndeletion analysis indicated that theD1domain ofD53was essential for\nthe GR24-dependent D53\u2013D14 interaction. Interestingly, its binding\nactivity was inhibited by the M and D2 domains, although their nega-\ntive effect can be overcome by the N domain (Extended Data Fig. 7).\nWe verified the D53\u2013D14 interaction in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf\ncell nucleus both in the presence or absence of exogenously applied\nGR24 using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay\n(Fig. 3b).Theobserved interactionbetweenD53 andD14 in the absence\nof exogenously applied GR24might be due to the effect of endogenous\nSLs present in the tobacco leaf cells. Consistent with the previously\nreported GR24-depedent interaction between DAD2 and PhMAX2A\n(anorthologue ofD3 inpetunia) in yeast19, our in vitropull-downassay\nalso revealed a direct physical interaction between D14 and D3 in a\nGR24-dependent manner (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, using recombinant\nglutathione S-transferase (GST)\u2013D3\u2013OSK1 fusion protein as the bait,\nour in vitro pull-down assay showed that D14 could bemore efficiently\nco-immunoprecipitated from d3 plant extracts in the presence of exo-\ngenously applied GR24 (Fig. 3d). Together, these results suggest that\nSLs may act to promote complex formation among D14, D3 and D53,\nlinking D53 to the hormone-perception components of the SL signal-\nling pathway.\n\nGR24 promotes D53 protein degradation\nTo investigate how SL regulates D53, we performed a set of additional\nexperiments. Both western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy\nexamination showed that GR24 treatment induced rapid degradation\nof the D53 protein in wild-type cells, but not in d3 or d14mutant cells\n(Fig. 4a\u2013c). We further showed that D53 was degraded by the protea-\nsome, as a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, but not other protease inhibi-\ntors, effectively blocked GR24-inducedD53\u2013GFP degradation (Fig. 4c, d\nand ExtendedData Fig. 8a, b). Notably, unlike thewild-typeD53\u2013GFP\nfusionprotein, themutant d53\u2013GFP fusionprotein appeared to be stable\nin the presence of GR24 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 8b). Interes-\ntingly, we noted that D53\u2013GFP and D53\u2013luciferase (LUC) were still\ndegraded in the d53 mutant cells, but not in d3 or d14 mutant cells\n(Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8c), indicating that the D53 degrada-\ntion pathway was still operational in the d53mutant. Together, these\nresults suggest that SL triggers proteasome-mediated degradation of\nD53 in a D14- and D3-dependent manner. Importantly, the insensi-\ntivity of d53 protein to SL-triggered turnover is consistent with the\nobserved dominant gain-of-function mutant phenotype of d53.\nTo provide genetic support for the functional relationship between\n\nD53, D3 and D14, we generated d3 d53 and d14 d53 double mutants.\nThe d3 mutant had more tillers and it was shorter than the d14 and\n\nd53 singlemutants (ExtendedDataFig. 9a). Thed14d53doublemutants\nexhibited a dwarf tillering phenotype resembling the d14 and d53 par-\nental plants, whereas the d3d53doublemutant exhibited a dwarf tillering\nphenotype resembling d3 (Fig. 4e, f and Extended Data Fig. 9a). The\nlack of obvious additive effects among these mutants suggests thatD3,\nD14 and D53 act in the same signalling pathway. To further test their\nepistatic relationship, we knocked downD53 gene expression in the d3\nandd14backgrounds.As shown inFig. 4g andExtendedData Fig. 9b\u2013d,\nthe mutant phenotype of d3 and d14 was restored to nearly wild-type\nlevels, demonstrating that D53 acts downstream of D3 and D14, and\nthat accumulation of D53 protein is responsible for blocking SL sig-\nnalling and conferring the dwarf tillering phenotype in these mutants.\n\nDiscussion\nIt has been speculated that perception of SLs triggers the degradation\nof putative repressors by the SCFMAX2 ubiquitin ligase complex to sup-\npress shoot branching21,29,30. In this study, we established that D53 acts\nas a repressor of SL signalling in rice. Consistentwith theprevious obser-\nvation ofGR24-dependent interaction betweenDAD2 and PhMAX2A\n(ref. 19), we found that GR24 also promotes the interaction between\nD14with D53 andD3 (Fig. 3). Further, we showed that D53 is targeted\nfor degradation by the proteasome in a D14- and D3-dependent man-\nner (Fig. 4a\u2013d and Extended data Fig. 8). Together, these data collec-\ntively support the notion that SL perception by D14 acts to promote\nubiquitination of D53 by the D14\u2013SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase, and subse-\nquent degradation of D53 by the proteasome, leading to the propaga-\ntion of SL signal and downstream physiological responses (Fig. 5). Our\nfindings revealed a remarkable similarity between the hormonal per-\nception and signalling mechanism of SL and several other classes of\nplant hormones, including auxin, jasmonate and gibberellin25,38\u201340.\nInterestingly, a recent study reported that aD53 homologue inAra-\n\nbidopsis, SMAX1, acts downstream ofMAX2 (orthologue of rice D3)\nin repressing the seed germination and seedling photomorphogenesis\nphenotypes ofmax2, but not the lateral root formation, axillary shoot\ngrowth, or senescence phenotypes ofmax2 (ref. 41). Further, as observed\nfor D53, three closest homologues of D53 in Arabidopsis (designated\nSMXL6, SMXL7 and SMXL8) were also induced by GR24 treatment41,\nsuggesting thatD53 and its homologues have a broad role in regulating\ndifferent developmental processes and that the D3/D53 functional\nmodule is conserved between monocots and dicots. Consistent with\nthis notion, the SL-analogous compounds known as karrikins also use\na MAX2- and KAI2 (D14-LIKE)-dependent pathway to regulate seed\ngermination and seedling growth29,42. The identification and charac-\nterization of D53 in SL signalling now sets the stage for further dis-\nsection of the mechanisms by which SLs regulate plant form and its\ncomplex interactions with parasitic weeds and symbiotic arbuscular\nmycorrhizal fungi3.\n\nMETHODS SUMMARY\nThe Methods provide detailed information about all experimental procedures,\nincluding description of plant materials and growth conditions, map-based clon-\ning ofD53, vector construction and plant transformation, rice hydroponic culture\n\nD\no\n\nw\nn\ns\ntr\n\ne\na\nm\n\n \n  \n  \nta\n\nrg\ne\nts\n\nD14\n\nSL\n\nD53\n\nD\n5\n3\n\nD14\n\n    SCF \ncomplex\n\n  \n  \nS\n\nC\nF\n \n\nc\no\nm\n\np\nle\n\nx\n\no\nm\n\npS\nC\n\nm\np\nl\n\nS\nC\n\nF\np\nlelele\n\nx\n\nC\nF e\nx\n\ne\nx\n\nE2\n\nD14\n\nSL\n\nSL\n\nUbiquitination\n\n      Proteasome\n\nUbiquitin\n\n  \n \n\nc\no\n\nc\no\n\nDD\n\nD3\n\nD3\n\nFC1\n\nE2\n\nD\n5\n3\n\nD\no\n\nw\nn\ns\ntre\n\na\nm\n\n     ta\nrg\n\ne\nts\n\n      D53\ndegradation\n\nFigure 5 | A schematic model depicting that SL promotes D14\u2013SCFD3-\nmediated degradation ofD53.

The wild-type rice (Oryza sativa L.\nsubspecies japonica) varieties used in this study were Norin 8 (for d53, d14 and\nd27), Akumuro (for d3), Shiokari (for d10 and d17) and Kitaake (for transforma-\ntion analyses). The d53-carrying line, KL908,was initially identified fromamutant\nlibrary of Norin 8 mutagenized by 60Co-c irradiation31. The d27 and d14mutants\nwere describedpreviously14,43. The d3mutant used in thiswork carries a premature\nstop codon (unpublished data). The d14 d53 and d3 d53 double mutants were\ngenerated by crossing their respective parental lines and identified by genotyping\nfrom their respective F2 or F3 populations.\nRice plantswere cultivated in the experimental field at theNanjingAgricultural\n\nUniversity in Nanjing in the natural growing seasons. For qRT\u2013PCR, GR24 treat-\nment, SL analyses and transient expression assay, the seedlings of wild-type and\nmutants were grown in climate chambers (HP1500GS, Ruihua) at 70% humidity,\nunder long-day conditions with daily cycles of 14 h of light at 30 uC and 10 h of\ndark at 25 uC. Light was provided by fluorescent white-light tubes (400\u2013700 nm,\n250mmolm22 s21).\nMap-based cloning of D53. To map the D53 locus, the d53mutant was crossed\nwith a polymorphic javanica variety, Ketan Nangka. Rough mapping was per-\nformed with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers W1 (59-GGATGATGAGA\nTCCTAATGTAGAA-39 and 59-CATCCTTGGAAAATAGTGGG-39) and W2\n(59-GGCTTCATCTTTGGCGACC-39 and 59-CCGGATTCACGAGATAAACT\nCTC-39) using 242 normal plants obtained in the F2 population. Using 2,893 nor-\nmal plants,D53was finally mapped to a region between the SSRmarker Z7 (59-C\nAGAGACCAAGCAACAGAG-39 and 59-GGAGACGTGTGAGCTACAAC-39)\nand a derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) marker Z3 (59-G\nTTACCGCTCCTCCTCAGC-39 and 59-AGTAAAAATGTGGAGGGGCA-39).\nVector construction and plant transformation.To generate the pAct1::D53-GFP\nand pAct1::d53-GFP constructs, full-length complementaryDNAs (cDNAs) ofD53\nand d53 were amplified, and the PCR products were then cloned into the binary\nvector AHLG44 using the In-Fusion Advantage PCR Cloning Kit (Clontech) and\nsequenced (Biomed). The pAct1::GFP, pAct1::D53-GFP and pAct1::d53-GFP con-\nstructs were introduced into the wild-type variety Kitaake. The pAct1::D53-GFP\ntransgene was introduced into d3 and d14 backgrounds by genetic crosses.\nTo knock down the D53 gene, the D53-RNA interference (D53-RNAi) vector\n\nwas constructed using a 475-base pair cDNA fragment. The PCR fragment was\ncloned into the pEASY-Blunt cloning vector (TransGen), and the gene-specific\nfragmentwaspreparedbydouble digestionwithKpnI-SacI andPstI-BamHI, respec-\ntively, and then the PCR products were ligated to both sides of the FAD2 intron in\nthe binary vector pCUbi1390-DFAD2 in opposite orientation45 and sequenced.\nThe resultant constructs D53-RNAi and the control vector pCUbi1390-DFAD2\nwere separately introduced into d53, d3 and d14mutants.\nTo analyse the expression pattern of the D53 gene, a 2.7-kilobase promoter\n\nfragment was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA-1381Z and sequenced to\ncreate the pD53::GUS reporter gene construct, which was then introduced into\nwild-type rice cultivar Norin 8. All transgenic rice plants were generated using\nAgrobacterium-mediated transformation of rice calli, as described previously46.\nRice hydroponic culture and LC/MS\u2013MS analysis of epi-5DS. Preparation of\nhydroponic culture solution and treatment with GR24 (http://www.chiralix.com/)\nwere performed as described previously6. In brief, surface-sterilized rice seedswere\nincubated in sterilewater at 30 uC in the dark for 2 days. The germinated seedswere\ntransferred intohydroponic culturemediumsolidifiedwith 0.5%agar and cultured\nat 30 uC for 5 days. The 1-week-old seedlings were then transferred to a plastic pot\ncontaining hydroponic culture solution (500ml) and grown for an additional\n7 days (total 2weeks) or 28 days (total 5weeks). The hydroponic culture solution\nwith or without 1mMGR24 was renewed every week. For SL analysis, the 1-week-\nold seedlings were grown in hydroponic culture medium without Pi for an addi-\ntional 14 days (total 3weeks).\nSL analysis in rice root exudates was performed according to a previously\n\ndescribedmethod14 withminormodifications. For each sample, theweight of fresh\nrice roots was recorded and 50ml hydroponic culture medium was loaded onto a\npre-equilibratedOasisHLB3cc cartridges (Waters) after adding1 ngd6-5DSas the\ninternal standard. Subsequently, the columns were washed with de-ionized water.\nThe SL-containing fraction, eluted with acetone, was collected and dried up under\nnitrogen gas, then reconstructed in acetonitrile and subjected to UPLC\u2013MS/MS\nanalysis. The UPLC\u2013MS/MS system consists of a triple quadruple tandem mass\nspectrometer (Quattro Premier XE;WatersMSTechnology) and anAcquity Ultra\nPerformance Liquid Chromatograph (Acquity UPLC; Waters) equipped with a\nreverse phase column (BEH-C18, 2.13 100mm, 1.7mm;Waters).Mobile phase A\n(99.95% H2O 1 0.05% acetic acid) and mobile phase B (99.95% ACN 1 0.05%\nacetic acid) were pumped at a rate of 0.4mlmin21. The gradient started with 50%\nA and increased B from 50% to 70% in 5min. The column temperature was set\nto 25 uC. MS parameters were set to the following values: desolvation gas flow,\n\n800L h21; capillary voltage, 3.8 kV; cone voltage, 24V; desolvation temperature,\n350 uC; source temperature, 110 uC; collision energy 14V, using multiple reaction\nmonitoring (MRM) transition of m/z 331. 216 for the epi-5DS detection, and\nMRM transition of m/z 337. 222 for the d6-5DS detection. Data were analysed\nwithMassLynx software (V.4.1). The epi-5DS concentrations of rice exudates were\ncalculated by comparing the MRM relative response of epi-5DS with the d6-5DS\nones then divided by the weight of fresh rice roots.\nqRT\u2013PCR.Total RNAwas extracted using theRNeasy PlantMini Kit (QIAGEN).\nThen, 20ml cDNA was synthesized using 1mg RNA with the QuantiTect Reverse\nTranscription Kit (QIAGEN). qRT\u2013PCR (20ml reaction volume) was carried out\nusing 0.5ml cDNA, 0.2mMof each gene-specific primer and SYBR Premix Ex Taq\nKit (TaKaRa) in an ABI PRISM 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. The rice ubiquitin gene was used as the internal control.\nThe gene-specific primersused forqRT\u2013PCRare: ubiquitin gene (LOC_Os03g13170)\n(59-AACCAGCTGAGGCCCAAGA-39 and 59-ACGATTGATTTAACCAGTCCA\nTGA-39); D53 gene (59-CCAAGCAGTTTGAAGCGAC-39 and 59-CCGCAAGTT\nTATCAAAGTCAA-39);D10 gene (59-CGTGGCGATATCGATGGT-39 and 59-CG\nACCTCCTCGAACGTCTT-39); FC1 gene (59-CGACAGCGGCAGCTACTAC-39\nand 59-GCGAATTGGCGTAGACGA-39). Data from three replicates were analysed\nfollowing the relative quantification method47.\nHistological analysis and GUS staining. Culm segments of rice were fixed in\nFAA (formalin/acetic acid/50% ethanol, 2:1:17 (v/v/v)) overnight, followed by a\nseries of dehydration and infiltration, and embedded in paraffin (Paraplast Plus;\nSigma-Aldrich). The tissues were sliced into 8\u201312-mm sections with a microtome\n(Leica RM2265), and affixed tomicroscope slides. Paraffin was removed from the\nsections using xylene, and the sections were dehydrated through a gradient eth-\nanol series, and stained with toluidine blue. Sections were viewed under a light\nmicroscope (Leica DM5000B) and photographed using a Micro Colour charge-\ncoupled device camera (Leica DFC490).\nGUS histochemical staining was performed according to a method described\n\npreviously48. Various tissues or hand-cut sections of pD53::GUST1 generation trans-\ngenicplantswere incubated in a staining solution containing 100mMNaPO4 buffer,\npH7.0, 2mMX-Gluc, 0.5mMK3Fe(CN)6, 0.5mMK4Fe(CN)6, 0.1%TritonX-100\nand 10 mM Na2-EDTA at 37 uC. Samples were vacuum-infiltrated briefly at the\ninitiation of stainingwithX-Gluc solution.After staining, the staining solutionwas\nremoved and the sample was washedwith several changes of 50% ethanol until the\ntissue became clear. Images were taken directly or under the stereomicroscope.\nY2H assay. Coding regions of the rice D53, d53 and various domain deletion\nvariants ofD53were cloned into the Y2H \u2018prey\u2019 vector pGADT7 (Clontech). The\ncoding region of riceD14 was cloned into the Y2H \u2018bait\u2019 vector pGBKT7 (Clontech).\nBait andpreyconstructswereco-transformed into theyeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)\nstrain Y2HGold (Clontech) and the resultant yeast stains were grown on SD2Leu/\n2Trp plates for 3 days at 30 uC. Interactions between bait and preywere examined on\nthe control media2LT (SD2Leu/2Trp) and selectivemedia2LTHA (SD2Leu/\n2Trp/2His/2Ade) or2LTHA plus X-a-gal in the presence or absence of 5mM\nGR24. Plates were incubated for 4 days at 30 uC. Yeast strains containingD53, d53\nor D14 in combination with pGADT7 or pGBKT7 were used as controls.\nAntibody preparation. For detection of D53, a His-fused protein-specific poly-\npeptide (amino acids 963\u20131,112 of D53 protein) was expressed in BMRosetta\n(DE3) cells (Biomed), and then affinity purified. Subsequently, the recombination\nprotein was injected into rabbits to produce polyclonal antibodies against D53\n(Abmart). For detection of D14 protein, a His-fused polypeptide (amino acids\n153\u2013302 of D14) was expressed in BMRosetta (DE3) cells. Purified fusion protein\nwas injected into rats to produce polyclonal antibodies against D14 (Abmart).\nThe loading control used is anti-HSP82 antibody (Beijing Protein Innovation).\nIn vivo degradation assay of D53.One-week-old rice seedlings were treated with\nor without 5 mMGR24 and collected at different time points. To block proteaso-\nmal protein degradation, seedlings were pre-treated with 40mM MG132 for 2 h.\nTotal protein was extracted and denatured in the SDS sample buffer containing\n5%b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME) at 95 uC for 10min.Western blots were performed\nusing the antiserum against D53 and visualized by an enhanced horseradish\nperoxidase-diaminobenzidine (HRP-DAB) substrate kit (Tiangen).\nThe pAct1::D53-GFP and pAct1::d53-GFP transgenic plants were treated with\n\n5 mM GR24 with or without the following inhibitors: MG132 (40 mM), AEBSF\n(500 mM), pepstatinA (1 mM)or leupeptin (20mM).GFP fluorescence in nuclei of\ntransgenic root cells was observed and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scan-\nning confocal microscope.\nBiFC assay. The full-length D14 and D53 cDNAs were cloned into the binary\nvectors pSPYNE173 and pSPYCE(M) to create the D14-NY andD53-CY vectors,\nrespectively. For transient expression,A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 carrying the\ngene of interest (at anOD600 of 0.1)was co-infiltratedwith p19 strain into a 5-week-\nold N. benthamiana leaf as described previously49. After 2 days, infiltrated leaves\nwere sprayed with (1) or without (2) 5mM GR24 24 h before leaf excision. The\n\nARTICLE RESEARCH\n\nMacmillan Publishers Limited.

The wavelengths for eYFP and\nDAPI were 514 and 405 nm for excitation, and 527 and 488 nm for detection,\nrespectively.\nRecombinant protein preparation. The full-length open reading frames of D3\u2013\nOSK1 and D14 were cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector, generating a fusion with\nthe GST protein. The full-length cDNA of D3 was cloned into the pMAL-c2x\nvector to generate a fusion withMBP. Expression of GST, GST\u2013D3\u2013OSK1, GST\u2013\nD14,MBP andMBP\u2013D3 inBL21Rosetta cells was inducedwith 0.1mM isopropyl-\nb-D-thiogalactoside at 20 uC for 16h. Fusionproteinswere purified usingGSTBind\nResin (Novagen) or amylose-affinity chromatography (New England Biolabs)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols and quantified by the Bio-Rad protein\nassay reagent.\nPull-down assays.One-week-old rice seedlingswere pre-treatedwith 40mMMG132\nfor 1h and then treated with or without 5mMGR24 for 30min. Total proteins were\nsubsequently extracted in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50mM\nTris-HCl, pH7.2, 150mM NaCl, 10mMMgCl2, 13 complete protease inhibitor\ncocktail, Roche) containing 40mMMG132. After centrifugation (16,000g at 4 uC),\nthe supernatant was collected. Total protein concentration was determined by the\nBradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Roughly equal amounts of purified GST and\nGST\u2013D3\u2013OSK1 fusion proteins (about 50mg) were affixed to GST Bind Resin and\nthen mixed with 300ml of plant extract (containing 1.5mg total proteins). After\nbeing gently shaken at 25 uC for 15min, the resinwaswashed five timeswith RIPA\nbuffer. During all the procedures, 5mMGR24 was added to the assay mixture for\nGR24-treated seedlings and was not added to the protein samples from seedlings\nnot treated with GR24. Proteins were detected with anti-D14 antibodies at 1:1,000\ndilution and visualizedwith enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GEHealthcare).\nFor in vitro pull-down, GST\u2013D14 (5 mg) was incubated withMBP\u2013D3 (6 mg) or\n\nMBP (2mg) at 25 uC for 15min in300ml of binding buffer (20mMTris-HCl, pH7.6,\n2.5mM b-ME and 0.1M NaCl) with or without 10mM GR24. After incubation,\n20ml of GST resin was added. After further incubation at 25 uC for 15min, the\nresin was washed five times with the washing buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,\n500mM NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100). The washing buffer also contains 10 mM\nGR24 where appropriate. After washing, 40 ml of 13 SDS\u2013PAGE sample buffer\nwere added, themixture was denatured, and the sample was loaded on a 8% SDS\u2013\nPAGEgel, and proteins were detected by theHRP-conjugated anti-MBP antibody\n(NewEngland Biolabs) and visualizedwith enhanced chemiluminescence reagent\n(GE Healthcare).\n\nTransient expression assays. TheD53, d53,D3 andD14 full-length cDNAs were\ncloned into the vector pA7-GFP or pGreenII 0800-LUC to generate D53\u2013GFP or\nD53\u2013LUC recombinant plasmids for transient expression assays, respectively.\nPlasmids DNA was prepared using the Plasmid Midi Kits (Qiagen) according\nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For preparation of rice protoplasts, the ster-\nilized seeds were germinated and grown in climate chambers for 7\u201310 days. Green\ntissues from the stem and sheath of 40\u201360 rice seedlings were used. The proto-\nplasts isolation and polyethyleneglycol (PEG) -mediated transfections procedure\nwere carried out as described previously50. GFP fluorescence fromprotoplasts was\nobserved and imaged as described above. For measurement of the relative luci-\nferase activity, protoplasts were incubated overnight and then treated with or\nwithout 5mM GR24 for 4 h.
