AKT  at Ser473  was  phosphorylated  in several  lung  cancer  cell\nlines  with  loss  of PTEN  expression.  Therefore,  we created  a  tetracycline  inducible  expression  system  of\nwild-type  PTEN  (PTEN-WT)  as  well  as  catalytically  (PTEN-G129R)  and  lipid  phosphatase  (PTEN-G129E)\ninactive  PTEN  mutants  using  the  PC14,  PC9  and  PC3 lung  adenocarcinoma  cell  lines,  in which  endoge-\nnous  PTEN  expression  was  not  detected  and  AKT  at Ser473  was  phosphorylated  by Western  blot  analysis.\nInduction  of  PTEN-WT  reduced  phosphorylation  of AKT  and  inhibited  the  transcriptional  activity  of\nNFkB,  whereas  PTEN  mutants  did  not,  suggesting  that  PTEN  inactivation  results  in  the  activation  of  the\nnvasion\nung cancer\nene cloning\n\nAKT/NFkB  pathway  in  PC14,  PC9  and  PC3  cells.  Furthermore,  overexpression  of  PTEN-WT  suppressed\nanchorage  independent  growth  in  soft  agar  and  reduced  invasiveness  in  a trans-well  chamber  assay  of\nPC14 cells.  Neither  PTEN-G129R  nor  PTEN-G129E  had suppressive  effects  on  anchorage  independent\ngrowth  and  invasiveness.  Augmentation  of  invasiveness  by constitutively  active  AKT  was  also  shown  in\nmouse  NIH3T3  cells.  Therefore,  it was  strongly  indicated  that  activation  of  the  PI3K/AKT/NFkB  pathway\nby  PTEN  inactivation  results  in augmented  invasiveness  in lung  cancer  cells  and  lipid  phosphatase  activity\n\nn  this\nof  PTEN  plays  a  key  role  i\n\n. Introduction\n\nThe PTEN (phosphates and tensin homologue deleted on chro-\nosome 10) tumor suppressor gene is frequently deleted or\nutated in a wide variety of human cancers, including glioblas-\n\noma [1],  melanoma [2],  prostate cancer [3],  breast cancer [4],\nung cancer [5],  and endometrial cancer [6].  In addition, PTEN\nermline mutations are responsible for the development of Cow-\nen disease, Bannayan-Zonana syndrome [7,8] and Lhermitte\nuclos disease, in which disorganized hamartomas appear in\narious organs [9].  Besides functioning as a tumor suppres-\nor, PTEN is also essential for embryonic development [10,11].\nTEN encodes a protein that has sequence homology with\nhosphatases which dephosphorylate both tyrosine and ser-\n\nne/threonine phosphates on proteins [12\u201314].  PTEN is also capable\nf dephosphorylating inositol phospholipids [15]. In particular,\n\nTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate\nPIP3) and phosphatidylinositol-4.5-biphosphate (PIP2). Formation\nf these lipids is catalyzed by phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\npon stimulation with growth factors [16]. PIP2 and PIP3 are both\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

One important\ndownstream target of PI3K is the AKT serine/threonine kinase [19].\nAKT is recruited to the plasma membrane by PIP3, and then phos-\nphorylated at Thr308 by protein dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). For\nfull activation, AKT needs to be subsequently phosphorylated at\nSer473 by PDK2. Activated AKT leaves the membrane and phos-\nphorylates its downstream targets such as Bad [20], IKKalpha\nand mTOR [20,21]. AKT activation induces expression of the anti-\napoptotic Bcl-2, activation of NFkB, inhibition of Forkhead family\nof transcription factors, and inactivation of pro-apoptotic Bad\n[22\u201325]. AKT-mediated modifications of above target genes ulti-\nmately result in cellular transformation, survival, proliferation and\ninvasion of a variety of cancers [26\u201329].\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world\n[30], and approximately 90% of patients with lung cancer ultimately\ndie from metastatic disease [31]. Metastasis is the end result of a\ncomplex series of steps involving multiple tumor-host interactions\n[32]. One important step in this process is invasion of cancer cells.\nPTEN is inactivated in a subset of and Akt is activated frequently in\n\nlung cancer. However, it is unknown whether PTEN plays any role\nin lung cancer cell invasion and whether such an effect is mediated\nthrough the PI3K/AKT/NFkB pathway. To address this question, we\nfirst screened several lung cancer cell lines for the status of PTEN\nand AKT. We  then constructed a PTEN inducible system using the\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.01.012\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcan\nmailto:hakanakca@yahoo.com\nmailto:hakca@pau.edu\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.01.012\n\n\nancer\n\nP\nA\np\nt\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(\ns\nw\n\n2\n\nt\ng\na\nt\n(\nA\nr\nT\n3\nc\nv\nw\n(\np\nw\np\ns\nc\ne\na\np\nt\n\n2\n\nT\nd\ng\nw\ng\nm\nb\nf\nh\no\na\nc\n(\n\n2\n\np\n9\n(\nb\nk\n\nH.

The results indicate that PTEN inactivation\nlays an important role in the invasiveness of lung cancer cells and\nhis process is mediated by the PI3K/AKT/NF-kB pathway.\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1. Cell culture\n\nPC3, PC9 and PC14 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium\nSigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine\nerum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37 \u25e6C in a humidified incubator\nith 5% CO2.\n\n.2. Construction of PTEN expression vectors and transfection\n\nPTEN cDNA was cloned as described by Myers et al. [33]. Briefly,\notal RNA was extracted from A549 cells using Trizol (Life Technolo-\nies), and the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT)\nnd Superscript RNaseH2 RT, according to the manufacturer\u2019s pro-\nocol (Life Technologies). PTEN cDNA was amplified using forward\n5\u2032-CGCGAATTCGCCATGGCAGCCATCATCAAAGAGATCGTTAGCAG-\nAACAAAAGGAGATATCAAGAGGATGGATTCGACTTAGAC-3\u2032) and\neverse (5\u2032-CGCGAATTCTCAGACTTTTGTAATTTGTGTATGCTGATCT-\nCATCAAAAGGTTCATTCTCTGGATCAGAGTCAGTGGAGGTGTCAGA-\n\u2032) primers and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and amplified\nDNA was cloned into pcDNA 3 and a tetracycline inducible\nector pcDNA4/TO. The PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E mutants\nere generated by site-directed mutagenesis. By using FUGEN\n\nRoche), PC14 cells were first stably transfected with a regulatory\nlasmid pcDNA6/TK, and clones resistant to blasticidin (10 \ufffdg/ml)\nere then stably transfected with the pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-WT,\ncDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129R, and pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129E expres-\nion vectors. Double transfectants were selected in the medium\nontaining blasticidin (10 \ufffdg/ml) and zeocin (50 \ufffdg/ml). PTEN\nxpression was induced by addition of tetracycline (2 \ufffdg/ml)\nnd was verified by Western blot analysis. pcDNA-PTEN-WT,\ncDNA-PTEN-G129R and pcDNA-PTEN-G129E vectors used for\nransient transfection studies.\n\n.3. Western blot analysis\n\nCell lysates were prepared in ice-cold RIPA buffer (10 mM\nris\u2013HCl pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 1% sodium\neoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Cellular debris was removed by centrifu-\nation at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min  at 4 \u25e6C. One hundred \ufffdg of proteins\nere subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE using 2\u201315% or 7.5% polyacrylamide\n\nels (PIERCE), proteins were immunoblotted onto Hybond-PVDF\nembrane (Amersham-PharmaciaBiotech), and labeled with anti-\n\nodies. AKT and phospho-AKT (Ser473) antibodies were obtained\nrom Cell Signaling Technology. PTEN, GAPDH, Tubulin and\norseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were\nbtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Primary and secondary\nntibody labeling blots were treated with Super Signal West Pico\nhemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), exposed to Hyperfilm ECL\nAmersham-PharmaciaBiotech), and developed.\n\n.4. Proliferation assay\n\nMock, pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-WT, pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129R, and\n\ncDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129E transfected PC14 cells were seeded into\n6-well plates (7.5 \u00d7 104 cells/ml) and treated with tetracyclin\n2 \ufffdg/ml) for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, cell num-\ners were counted by a luminometric method using a CytotoxGlo\nit (Promega).\n 73 (2011) 302\u2013 309 303\n\n2.5. Luciferase reporter assay\n\nMock, pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-WT, pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129R,\npcDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129E stably transfected PC14 cells were\ntransfected with pGL3-NFkB-promoter-Luc (0.5 \ufffdg/well)\nand with pRL-Renilla (0.05 \ufffdg/well). For PC9 and PC3 cells;\nMock, pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-WT, pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129R,\npcDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129E transiently co-transfected with\npGL3-NFkB-promoter-Luc (0.5 \ufffdg/well) and with pRL-Renilla\n(0.05 \ufffdg/well). Following transfection, cells were treated with\ntetracyclin (2 \ufffdg/ml) and cultured for an additional 24 h. Luciferase\nactivities were then measured using a luciferase Assay System Kit\n(Promega).\n\n2.6. Soft agar colony assay\n\nAnchorage independent growth was determined by a soft agar\ncolony assay as described [34]. Briefly, 5 \u00d7 104 cells were prepared\nin 3 ml  of medium containing 0.4% noble agar (Difco), and layered\nonto 5 ml  of bottom layer containing 0.5% noble agar (Difco). Two\n\ufffdg/ml tetracycline was added to both layers. Plates were incubated\nfor 2\u20133 weeks, developed colonies were fixed and stained with\nHBSS containing 1.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.06% methylene blue,\nand visible colonies were counted.\n\n2.7. Cell invasion assay\n\nCell invasion assays were carried out using a trans-well matrigel\ninvasion chamber (Becton Dickinson Labware). The chambers\nwere hydrated with 1% BSA in RPMI-1640 for 1 h at room\ntemperature, then placed into 24-well tissue culture plates con-\ntaining 750 \ufffdl of RPMI-1640 with 10% FCS. For invasion study,\nwe transiently transfected PC9 and PC3 cells with pcDNA-\nPTEN-WT, pcDNA-PTEN-G129R, pcDNA-PTEN-G129E and stably\ntrasnfected PC14 cells with pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-WT, pcDNA4/TO-\nPTEN-G129R, pcDNA4/TO-PTEN-G129E expression vectors. All\ncells were trypsinized, washed twice in PBS, and 1 \u00d7 104 cells were\nadded to each trans-well chamber and allowed to migrate to the\nbottom chamber for 24 h. Two \ufffdg/ml tetracycline was added to\nboth chambers, After 24 h, cells on the upper surface of the fil-\nter were then removed by wiping with a cotton swab, and the\nnumber of migrated cells was  determined. The extent of migration\nwas  expressed by normalizing the number of PTEN-WT, PTEN-\nG129R and PTEN-G129E expressing cells by that of empty vector\ntransfected cells. Ten individual wells were counted for every\nexperiment. Error bars representing S.E. and Ps were calculated by\nrepeated measurements of ANOVA (Graphpad Software), followed\nby a Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effects of PTEN expression on the PI3K/AKT/NFkB pathway in\nlung cancer cells\n\nWe first examined expression levels of PTEN in 9 lung cancer\ncell lines and in an immortalized small airway epithelial cell line,\nhSAEC-T1 [35], by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). PTEN expression\nwas  detected in H23, II-18, KTSQ-1 and PC13 cells, but the amounts\nof PTEN protein in these cell lines were slightly lower than that\nin hSAEC-T1 cells. PTEN was  not detected in the remaining five cell\nlines, PC14, PC9, PC3, PC10 and H1299, suggesting that PTEN is inac-\n\ntivated in these cell lines. It was  previously reported that both allele\nof PTEN gene is deleted in PC10 and its promoter is methylated in\nPC14 and H1299 cells [5,36,37]. Consistent with these findings we\ndid not observe any PTEN expression in these cells. Since AKT is\ndownstream of the PTEN pathway and is often phosphorylated in\n\n\n\n304 H.

Proteins were blotted onto PVDF membrane and labeled against\nndicated antibodies.\n\nells with PTEN inactivation, we next investigated the expression\nnd phosphorylation of AKT in these cell lines. AKT was  detected\nn all the cell lines examined. AKT at Ser473 was phosphorylated in\nve cell lines, PC14, PC9, PC3, PC10 and H1299, all of which showed\nhe absence of PTEN protein. Therefore, it was strongly indicated\nhat PTEN inactivation results in the activation of AKT in these lung\nancer cell lines.\n\nTo examine the effect of PTEN expression in lung cancer cells,\netracycline-inducible PTEN vectors were constructed and trans-\nected into PC14 cells, in which endogenous PTEN expression was\not detected by Western blot analysis. Vectors carrying wild-type\nTEN (PTEN-WT) as well as catalytically (PTEN-G129R) and lipid\nhosphatase (PTEN-G129E) inactive PTEN mutants were prepared\nor this study as described in Materials and Methods. These vectors\nere stably transfected into PC14 cells, transiently transfected in\n\nC9 and PC3 cells, and PTEN induction after tetracycline treatment\nas confirmed by Western blot analysis. Representative results of\n\nTEN induction are shown in Fig. 2A. Wild-type PTEN expression\nas detected 4 h after tetracycline treatment, reached the maxi-\num level at 24 h, and continued up to 120 h after the treatment.\ne  were also able to obtain PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E mutant-\n\nnducible cells. Induction of PTEN after 24 and 48 h of tetracycline\nreatment in PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E transfected\nells are shown in Fig. 2B.\n\nWe next examined the effects of induced PTEN expression\nn phosphorylation levels of AKT in PC14 cells (Fig. 2B). The\nmount of phosphorylated AKT was decreased at both 24 h and\n8 h after tetracycline treatment in PTEN-WT transfectants. In con-\nrast, such a decrease was not observed in mock, PTEN-G129R and\nTEN-G129E transfectants.

To determine the effect of AKT activity on NFkB activation\nthese cells were co-transfected with pGL3-NFkB-promoter-Luc (0.5 \ufffdg/well) and\n06 H. Akca et al. / Lung C\n\nTEN inhibited the growth of PC14 cells in soft agar, but nei-\nher PTEN-G129E nor PTEN-G129R had such an effect on PC14\nells. Therefore, anchorage independent growth but not anchorage\nependent growth was suppressed by wild-type PTEN expression\n\nn PC14 cells.\nTo further explore whether PTEN inhibits cell invasion, we  next\n\nerformed a cell invasion assay using PC14 transfectants. As shown\nn Fig. 3C, cell invasiveness was reduced by 72% in PC14 cells\nxpressing wild-type PTEN compared to a mock transfectant. Such\nnvasiveness was not suppressed in cells expressing PTEN-G129E\nnd PTEN-G129R, suggesting that inhibition of invasion was  depen-\nent on lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN. To confirm our results\nnd to discard cell specific findings PTEN-negative PC9 and PC3\nells were transiently transfected with PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129R and\nTEN-G129E. We  observed that ectopic expression of PTEN can sup-\nress PC9 and PC3 cell invasion by inhibition of AKT/NFkB pathway\nhrough its lipid phosphatase activity (Fig. 5).\n\n.3. Effects of PTEN expression on invasiveness of mouse NIH3T3\nells\n\nSince the AKT activity was robustly affected by PTEN activity in\nC14, PC9 and PC3 cells, we assumed that regulation of cell inva-\niveness by PTEN might be dependent on AKT activity in cells. To\nonfirm this assumption, NIH3T3/CA-AKT cells expressing consti-\nutively active AKT [38] were assessed by a cell invasion assay. AKT\ns constitutively phosphorylated in NIH3T3/CA-AKT cells but not\nn parental NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4A), and NFkB activation was shown\ny a reporter assay (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we compared the invasive-\ness of parental NIH3T3 cells and NIH3T3/CA-AKT cells by a cell\n\nnvasion assay. As shown in Fig. 4C, NIH3T3/CA-AKT cells showed\n times higher invasiveness in comparison with parental NIH3T3\nells. These results support our hypothesis that cell invasiveness is\nargely regulated by AKT and NFkB activities in all PC14, PC9, PC3\nnd NIH3T3 cells.\n\n. Discussion\n\nLung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death world-\nide [39]. Metastases are the major cause of death from cancer;\nowever, molecular mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis remain\n\nargely unclear. In normal lung tissues, high levels of PTEN expres-\nion were detected in 100% [40], while, in lung cancer cell lines,\nTEN expression was lost in 44% and reduced in 29% [41]. Our\nesults indicates that PTEN expression is lost in \u223c50% of NSCLC cells.\nhis finding was in good agreement with previous findings, show-\nng that high levels of PTEN expression were detected in normal\nung tissue [40], while PTEN expression was lost in 44% and reduced\nn 29% of lung cancer cell lines [41]. Moreover, PTEN deletion was\neported to occur in 2% of NSCLC cells [5].  Therefore, it is likely that\neletion is not a common mechanism of loss of PTEN expression.\noro et al. [37] reported that the PTEN gene is not deleted but its\nromoter region is hypermethylated in PC14 cells. Moreover, they\nlso reported that, following 5-aza-dC treatment, PTEN mRNA and\nrotein was increased in PC14 cells. They also showed in the same\nrticle that the mechanism of loss of PTEN expression in PC9 cells is\nistone deacetylation [37]. Furthermore, Soria et al. [36] reported\nhat PTEN promoter is hypermethylated in H1299 cells and PTEN\n\nRNA was increased after 5-aza-dC treatment in this cell line. It\nas reported that overexpression of phosphorylated AKT and loss\nf PTEN expression are associated with poor prognosis of patients\nith NSCLC [40]. In our previously published study, levels of AKT\nhosphorylation were enhanced by EGF treatment in PC3, PC9,\nC14 and H1299 cells without PTEN expression, but unchanged in\nI-18 and PC13 cells with PTEN expression [42]. This result further\n\nwith pRL-Renilla (0.05 \ufffdg/well) vectors, 24 h after transfection cells were lysed and\nlusiferase activities were measured (B).

After 24 h of transfection PTEN expressions\nand  their effects on AKT phosphorylations were determined by western blot anaysis (A). PC9 and PC3 cells were co-transfected with PTENwt, PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E\nexpression vectors and with pRL-Renilla (0.05 \ufffdg/well) vectors and 24 h after transfection cells were lysed and luciferase activities were measured (B).

Therefore, we  assumed\n\nhat PTEN inactivation and its effect on the PI3K/AKT/NFkB path-\nay could be important in lung cancer cell invasion. To address our\nypothesis, we first examined the expression status of PTEN pro-\nectors by FUGEN HD transfection reagent. After 24 h cells were counted and 1 \u00d7 10\nntaining 2 \ufffdg/ml tetracycline. Chemoattractant conditions were created by addition\nd counted (C). Error bars indicate S.D., *p < 0.05 comparing PTENwt transfected cells\ntein in 9 lung cancer cell lines. PTEN expression was lost in 5 and\nreduced in 4 of the 9 cell lines when compared with an immortal-\nized small airway epithelial cell line. These results are consistent\nwith previous results [40]. We  also found increased AKT activities\nin cell lines with loss of PTEN expression. Therefore, AKT activ-\n\n\n\n3 ancer\n\ni\nl\n\nd\nm\na\nh\nn\nt\ne\nb\nO\nd\ne\na\ni\ni\ng\nt\na\n\nb\nn\na\nc\nW\na\nP\nt\nt\ni\nc\ne\n[\nt\np\nl\nc\nc\ne\nc\ne\no\nA\na\nf\nm\nc\na\nl\ni\nT\nN\np\ni\nv\n\nt\ng\ns\n\nC\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n[\n\n08 H. Akca et al. / Lung C\n\nty is well associated with the expression of PTEN in these 9 cell\nines.\n\nWe then pursued the effect of PTEN expression on anchorage\nependent and independent growth of PC14 cells. We  first deter-\nined the in vitro growth rates of mock, PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129R\n\nnd PTEN-G129E expressing PC14 cells, and found that all cells\nave similar proliferation rates, suggesting that PTEN activity does\not affect PC14 cell proliferation under standard culture condi-\nions. Furnari et al. [43] reported that PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E\nxpression did not change the glioblastoma cell proliferation rates\nut PTEN-WT expression inhibited proliferation by the 7th day.\nur results are not consistent with their findings; however, we\netermined the rate of proliferation only after 3 days. We  next\nxamined the effects of wild-type and mutant PTEN expression on\nnchorage independent growth. Only wild-type PTEN expression\nnhibited anchorage independent growth but neither catalytically\nnactive nor lipid phosphatase dead PTEN had an effect to inhibit the\nrowth. Previous studies also showed that PTEN expression inhibits\nhe anchorage independent growth of hepatoma [44], breast cancer\nnd melanoma cell lines [45].\n\nPTEN expression has been also shown to suppress invasion of\nreast cancer, glioma and colon cancer cells [46\u201348].  Therefore, we\next attempted to elucidate whether PTEN inactivation is associ-\nted with invasion of lung cancer cells. We  used PC14, PC9 and PC3\nells, which lack endogenous PTEN expression, for this experiment.\n\ne stably transfected PC14 cells and transiently transfected PC9\nnd PC3 cells with mock, PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129E, and PTEN-G129R.\nTEN-WT inhibited the invasion of PC14, PC9 and PC3 cells respec-\nively 72%, 48% and 46%, but mutants of PTEN did not, suggesting\nhat lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is essential for NSCLC cell\nnvasion. PTEN can suppress prostate cancer cell [49] and glioma\nell [47] invasion, but the mechanism of this suppression is differ-\nnt between prostate cancer cells and glioma cells. Shukla et al.\n49] reported that PTEN can suppress prostate cancer cell invasion\nhrough the suppression of the PI3K/AKT pathway by its lipid phos-\nhatase activity, however, Maier et al. [47] reported that the PTEN\n\nipid phosphatase domain is not required for invasion of glioma\nells. Our results clearly indicate that PTEN suppresses lung cancer\nell invasion through its lipid phosphatase activity. Recently, Zhang\nt al. [50] reported that microRNA-21 promotes invasion of lung\nancer cells by repressing expression of PTEN, however, they didn\u2019t\nlucidate the molecular mechanisms of PTEN-mediated inhibition\nf lung cancer cell invasion. Since NFkB is a major target of activated\nKT, we attempted to find interactions between the AKT/NFkB\nctivity and lung cancer cell invasion. Therefore, reporter vectors\nor NFkB luciferase and renilla luciferase were co-transfected in\n\nock, PTEN-WT, PTEN-G129R and PTEN-G129E expressing PC14\nells. The result indicated that only wild-type PTEN inhibits NFkB\nctivity, and implies that PTEN inhibits NFkB activity through its\nipid phosphatase activity and PTEN can inhibit lung cancer cell\nnvasion through the suppression of the PI3K/AKT/NFkB pathway.\no further confirm our hypothesis, we used parental NIH3T3 and\nIH3T3CA-AKT cells, in which constitutively active AKT is overex-\nressed [38]. AKT activation induced NFkB activation and cellular\n\nnvasion in NIH3T3 cells, supporting that AKT-mediated NFkB acti-\nation is necessary for lung cancer cell invasion.\n\nIn summary, we report here for the first time that activation of\nhe AKT/NFkB pathway is necessary for the anchorage independent\nrowth and invasion of lung cancer cells, and PTEN expression can\nuppress both processes by inhibiting the AKT/NFkB pathway.\nonflict of interest statement\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest for this article.\n\n[\n\n[\n\n 73 (2011) 302\u2013 309\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe  would like to thank Prof. Dr. Osman N.
