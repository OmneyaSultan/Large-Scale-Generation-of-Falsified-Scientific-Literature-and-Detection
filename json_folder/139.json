TIMP-3\nwas initially identified as a potent inhibitor of MMPs, however it also has several properties that\nare unique and not related to its ability to abrogate MMPs. We studied the effects of overex-\npression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) on lung cancer cells and explored\nthe mechanisms involved in apoptosis-induction in susceptible cells and subsequently, the ther-\napeutic effect in vivo. Overexpression of TIMP-3 resulted in apoptosis of A549 lung cancer cells\nand AdCMVTIMP3 up-regulated the expression of p53, Fas ligand, TNFR1 and TNFR2 on these\ncells. Adenoviral delivery of TIMP-3 gene inhibited the growth of pre-established A549 tumours\nin Balb/c nude mice, and was associated with a greater therapeutic effect than either TIMP-1\nor -2 gene delivery. There was no evidence of increased hepatic toxicity following the delivery\nof TIMP-3 either from intra-tumoural or intravenous injection. Thus, at least in cells showing\n\nin vitro susceptibility, TIMP-3 gene therapy offers a therapeutic advantage over TIMPs 1 and\n2. These findings establish the potential of adenoviral gene delivery of TIMP3 as a therapeutic\nagent for selected lung cancers.\n\u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

The understand-\nng of the molecular basis of cancer development and the\nechanisms of the development of metastases has increased\n\nhe potential targets for the development of effective anti-\nancer agents. Gene-based therapies provide an ideal oppor-\nunity to exploit this knowledge as novel therapeutic agents\nor the management of various cancers.\n\nDegradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) occurs\ns cells change their form, migrate or proliferate. Con-\nrolled matrix destruction is considered a key event in both\nocal invasion and the development of metastasis associ-\nted with tumour progression [3]. Matrix metalloproteinases\nMMPs) are zinc dependent endopeptidases that regulate\nhe movement of cells within the ECM and also degrade\nll of its components. They have important roles in tumour\nevelopment and in tumour cell survival [3,4]. MMPs are\nver-expressed in a number of cancers including lung can-\ner. This is associated with increased tumour aggressive-\ness and metastatic potential [3,4]. The intricate balance\netween net extracellular matrix deposition and degrada-\nion is controlled by a complex system of tightly regulated\nrotease enzymes and their endogenous inhibitors, which\nncludes the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)\n5]. It is postulated that inappropriate over-expression of\nMPs or under-expression of TIMPs constitutes part of the\nathogenic mechanism in cancer [6]. Therapies targeted to\nhe processes that inhibit MMP proteolysis and ECM break-\nown may specifically disrupt the growth of tumour without\nltering normal tissues. The increased local expression of\npecific TIMPs, which is achievable with gene delivery may\nrove a more efficient and effective mechanism for the\nnhibition of MMPs. Furthermore, it is now known that cer-\nain TIMPs possess additional properties which may have a\neneficial effect in cancer therapy beyond MMP inhibition\n7].\n\nTIMP-3 has several features that distinguish it from the\nther TIMPs. It binds tightly to the ECM following secre-\nion by the cell [8]. It inhibits vascular endothelial growth\nactor mediated angiogenesis by blocking the binding of\nEGF to VEGF receptor-2, inhibiting downstream signalling\nnd angiogenesis [9]. TIMP-3 also inhibits TNF-\ufffd-converting\nnzyme, a member of the ADAM family (a disintegrin and\netalloproteinase). This may account for its ability to\n\nnduce apoptosis [10]. It has been shown to induce apopto-\nis in a number of cancer cell lines [5,11,12]. It also inhibits\nhedding of ectodomains of cell surface receptors including\nyndecan-1 and -4, L-selectin and IL-6 receptors [10,13\u201415].\nt is plausible that loss of TIMP-3 within tumours may abro-\nate normal apoptotic programs, enhance primary tumour\nrowth and angiogenesis, invasiveness and metastasis and\nossibly therefore contribute to all stages of malignant pro-\nression [7]. Thus, TIMP-3 gene therapy may have significant\ndvantages over other TIMPs.\n\nTo date, less work has been done to evaluate the ther-\npeutic efficiency of TIMP-3 compared to TIMPs-1 and -2.\nrevious work with TIMP-2 gene delivery has shown ther-\n\npeutic effects in animal models, whereas the effects of\nIMP-1 are variable [16]. Further, not all cells lines are sus-\neptible to the apoptosis-inducing effects of TIMP-3 [17].\no direct comparisons of in vivo delivery of TIMP fam-\n\nly members have been reported. In the current study we\n\nv\ns\nw\nm\nu\n\nK.M. Finan et al.\n\netermined the effects of overexpression of adenovirally\nelivered TIMP-3 in susceptible lung cancer cells on prolif-\nration, apoptosis and cell death in vitro, in comparison to\nIMPs-1 and -2. We then determined whether susceptibility\no TIMP-3-induced apoptosis translated to therapeutic gains\nn vivo in over the effects seen to TIMPs-1 and 2.\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1. Adenoviral vectors\n\nirst generation adenoviral vectors containing the genes for\nither TIMP-1, -2 or -3, or the luciferase reporter gene each\nnder the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, have\neen described previously [18,19].\n\n.2. Cell lines and culture conditions\n\nell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture\nollection (ATCC). Human embryonic kidney cell line 293\nere used in the amplification and titration of adenovi-\n\nal vectors. The cells were cultured and maintained in\nulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM): F12 medium\n50:50) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS),\nenicillin and gentamycin, and maintained in a humidified\ntmosphere at 37 \u25e6C in 5% CO2. A549 lung cancer cells were\naintained in DMEM with bicarbonate, with similar antibi-\n\ntics and under the same conditions. The lung cancer cells\nines 1299, H1466, H322, 522, 2009 were maintained in RPMI\nedium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin and gen-\n\namycin, and maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 \u25e6C\nn 5% CO2.\n\nViral particles were purified by caesium chloride gradi-\nnt using standard techniques, then particle titres estab-\nished using OD260 absorbance, where one OD corresponds\no 1.1 \u00d7 1012 viral particles. Functional titres were deter-\nined by TCID50 in 293 cells.\n\n.3. Cell counting assays\n\nhe range of six lung cancer cell lines (1 \u00d7 105 cells ml\u22121)\nere examined for Coxsackie and adenoviral receptor (CAR)\nxpression by flow cytometry. Cells were infected with\ndCMVTIMP1, AdCMVTIMP2, AdCMVTIMP3 or AdCMVLuc at\n00 pfu cell\u22121 in 2% FCS medium, then after one hour\nwitched to complete medium and incubated for 24, 48, 72\nnd 96 h. At these time points, viable adherent cells were\nounted using a standard haemocytometer and trypan blue\nxclusion. In parallel crystal violet staining measurements\nf viable cells were also carried out.\n\n.4. Bystander effect\n\n.4.1. Infected cells transfer\n549 cells were transduced with 100 pfu of adenoviral\n\nectors-AdCMVLuc, AdCMVTIMP1, -2 and -3, as per the\ntandard protocol. After 24 h the cells were detached,\nashed with PBS and suspended in serum free culture\nedium. The cells were mixed in different ratios with\n\nninfected A549 cells and plated in six-well plates.

The cells were washed four\ntimes with PBS 24 h following infection and incubated in\ncomplete media. The media was collected 48 h later and\ntransferred to A549 cells plated in six-well plates in either a\n15% or 35% ratio. The number of viable cells was determined\nby manual counting at 96 h.\n\n2.5. Flow cytometry of apoptosis\n\n2.5.1. Annexin V staining\nCells infected as described were collected using standard\ntrypsin and resuspended in media. Adherent cells were\npooled with non-adherent cells. Cells were stained with\nAnnexin V (Pharmingen CA, USA) and Propidium Iodide (PI)\n(Sigma) which are sensitive to early and late apoptosis,\nrespectively, as previously reported [20]. Briefly, cells were\nwashed once with Annexin binding buffer, then centrifuged\n(300 \u00d7 g for 5 min) and the supernatant discarded. The cells\nwere stained with 2 \ufffdl Annexin and gently resuspended\nin 50 \ufffdl Annexin buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml PI and data\nacquired immediately. Early apoptotic, (Annexin V positive,\nPI negative cells), late apoptotic (Annexin V positive, PI pos-\nitive cells) and viable cells (Annexin V negative cells) were\nanalysed using Cell Quest software (BD) on a FACSCalibur\nflow cytometer (BD).\n\n2.6. Intracellular components of apoptosis\n\n2.6.1. Staining of apoptotic cells with Mab to active\nCaspases\nCells were prepared as previously described with viral and\nnon-viral controls. CaspACE FITC-VAD-FMK (Promega, WI,\nUSA) 10 \ufffdl was added to 900 \ufffdl cell sample and incubated\nat 37 \u25e6C for 15 min. Cells were washed with 1 ml 0.5%\nbovine serum albumin (Sigma) in Isoton II (Coulter), cen-\ntrifuged (300 \u00d7 g for 5 min) and gently resuspended in 50 \ufffdl\nof 5 \ufffdg ml\u22121 PI, then analysed using Cell Quest software (BD)\non a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD).\n\n2.6.2. Bax/Bcl2 staining\nSamples were washed with calcium and magnesium-free\nPBS, supernatant discarded and 200 \ufffdl of membrane per-\nmeabilising solution (0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 0.2 \ufffdg/ml\nNa2EDTA\u00b72H2O (APS Chemicals, NSW, Australia), 1% bovine\nserum albumin in PBS) added to the cell pellet. Tubes were\nmixed, and incubated at room temperature, in the dark,\nfor 15 min. Mabs to Bax (5 \ufffdl) (Oncogene Science, NY, USA)\nand Bcl-2 (10 \ufffdl) (Dako, Denmark) were added for 15 min at\nroom temperature, in the dark. Irrelevant, conjugated anti-\nbodies of the same isotypes were used as negative controls.\n\nFor Bcl-2 analysis of unwashed, unfixed cells was carried\nout immediately by flow cytometry. For Bax, cells were\nwashed and 5 \ufffdl PE-conjugated rat-anti-mouse Mab (RAM)\n(BD Biosciences, Sydney, Australia) was added for a further\n15 min prior to washing with 0.5% bovine serum albumin\n\ni\nc\na\na\nA\n\ne delivery translates to greater in vivo efficacy 275\n\nn Isoton II and list mode data acquired using CellQuest\noftware.\n\n.7.

Aliquots of\n\u00d7 105 cells were washed using 1 ml 0.5% bovine serum\nlbumin in Isoton II, centrifuged (300 \u00d7 g for 5 min), and\nently resuspended in 50 \ufffdl of wash buffer. Mabs to Fas\n5 \ufffdl) (Pharmingen, CA, USA), TNF-R1 (5 \ufffdl) and TNF-R2\n5 \ufffdl) (HyCult Biotechnology) were added for 15 min at room\nemperature and irrelevant, conjugated antibodies of the\name isotypes were used as controls. Samples for TNF-R1\nnd TNF-R2 were washed and resuspended with 5 \ufffdl Strepta-\nidin PE Mab (BD Biosciences) for 15 min. Cells were washed\nnd data acquired by flow cytometry immediately using Cel-\nQuest software.\n\n.7.2. Death receptor ligand\nliquots of cells were washed as above and gently resus-\nended in 50 \ufffdl of wash buffer. Mab to Fas ligand (2 \ufffdl)\nPharmingen) was added for 15 min at room temperature and\nrrelevant conjugated antibodies of the same isotype were\nsed as control.

Intracellular p53 in lung cancer cells\n\no detect the presence of p53 in the uninfected cell lines\ne used a PE labelled anti-p53 antibody (Pharmingen, CA,\nSA) with an isotype control. Aliquots of cells were added\no a membrane permeabilising solution (0.5% Triton-X-100,\n.2 \ufffdg/ml Na2EDTA\u00b72H2O, 1% BSA in PBS). The samples were\nixed and left at room temperature, in the dark, for 15 min.\nhen 5 \ufffdl anti-p53 was added for 15 min at room tempera-\nure. Analysis of unwashed, unfixed cells was carried out\nmmediately by flow cytometry and list mode data acquired\nsing CellQuest software.\n\n.9. Inhibitory experiments\n\nach of the blocking experiments was carried out in a sim-\nlar manner. The media was changed to 2% FCS 1 h prior\no the addition of the inhibitory agent. For the UV light\nxperiments the cells were exposed to UV light for 20 min\nrior to the addition of the blocking agent. The Anti Fas\nlone, ZB-4, (Upstate cell signalling solutions, NY, USA)\ns a neutralising monoclonal antibody to the Fas recep-\nor, was used in a concentration of 500 \ufffdg/ml, Z-VAD-FMK\nSigma\u2014Aldrich Inc., MS, USA) the caspase inhibitor was\nsed at a final concentration of 50 \ufffdM/ml and the p53\n\nnhibitor-Pifithrin-\ufffd (Sigma\u2014Aldrich Inc.) was used at a con-\nentration of 20 \ufffdM/ml.

Growth of lung cancer xenografts in nude\nalb/c mice\n\nll experiments with mice were performed in accordance\nith institutional animal care guidelines and approval of the\nnimal ethics board. Balb/c nude mice (4\u20146-week-old) were\nsed in all experiments. For in vivo experiments 1 \u00d7 106 A549\nells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of mice\nnd tumours established a minimum volume of 50\u2014100 mm3.\numour volume was calculated using the equation, vol-\nme = tumour length \u00d7 (tumour width)2/2. We injected\numours with 1 \u00d7 109 pfu of adenovirus in 50 \ufffdl PBS and\nontrol tumours with 50 \ufffdl PBS. Two injections on consecu-\nive days were given. Tumour volumes were measured twice\neekly using callipers. For TUNEL staining and immunohis-\n\nochemical analysis of angiogenesis, excised tumours from\nuthanised animals were immediately fixed in 10% formalde-\nyde overnight, and then embedded in paraffin.\n\nTo assess the potential liver toxicity that may develop as\nconsequence of adenoviral delivery of vectors we injected\n\nhe tail veins of Balb/c nude mice with 5 \u00d7 109 pfu of aden-\nvirus in 100 \ufffdl PBS. The animals were euthanised 72 h later;\nhe livers were examined directly using H + E staining and\nnalysis of liver enzymes (ALT and AST).\n\n.11. In situ TUNEL staining\n\npopTag Apoptosis Detection kit (CHEMICON International\nnc.) was used to detect DNA fragmentation in apoptotic\nells in vivo. Briefly, after deparaffinisation, tissues were\nigested with proteinase K (20 \ufffdg/ml) and endogenous per-\nxidase inactivated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Subse-\nuently, a mixture of Digoxenin-dUTP and terminal deoxynu-\nleotidyl transferase enzyme was added, and samples incu-\nated for 1 h at 37 \u25e6C. Anti-digoxigenin conjugate was added;\nolour developed with peroxidase substrate and counter-\ntained with methyl green (0.5%, w/v, methyl green in 0.1 M\nodium Acetate, pH 4.0). Specimens were mounted under\nlass coverslips. TUNEL positive cells were visualised by\nirect microscopy.\n\n.12. Immunohistochemistry of tumours\n\nhe target antigen retrieval solution (S-1699, DakoCytoma-\nion Pty Ltd., NSW, Australia) was used to maximise the\nntibody reaction. Factor VIII-R Ag (Cell Marque, AR, USA)\nnd Anti CD-31 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were used to detect\nhe presence of blood vessels within the tumour sections.\nhe fluorescent secondary antibodies used were Alexa Flour\n88, goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse, respectively\nMolecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). Sections of tumour\nere prepared on polysine slides using standard re-hydration\nechniques and then placed in preheated target retrieval\nolution according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The\nlides were washed and then blocked in 10% goat serum\nor 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody applied\no the selected tissues, Factor VIII at 1 in 100 dilution and\n\nt\nc\nt\nd\nd\n\nK.M. Finan et al.\n\nnti CD-31 at 1 in 10 dilution at 4 \u25e6C overnight. The fol-\nowing morning the tissues were washed and then blocked\nn 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The sec-\nndary antibodies were applied at 1 in 1000 dilution for 1.5 h\nt room temperature in the dark. They were then washed\ngain five times for 5 min each time in PBS. Nuclei were\nounterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidine-2\u2032-phenylinodole dihy-\nrochloride (DAPI (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) at 1 \ufffdg/ml\nilution was applied for 3\u20144 min, and then the slides were\nashed once for 5 min in PBS.

We detected the presence of TIMP-1\nnd -2 in conditioned media from cells transduced by these\niruses, thus confirming the functionality of all elements.\ne then characterised the cell lines with regard to the\n\nevels of expression of coxsackie and adenoviral receptor\nCAR; Fig. 1a), transducibility with an Ad vector carrying\nhe luciferase reporter gene (AdCMVLuc; Fig. 1b) and some\nf the cellular markers known to be involved in the apoptotic\nrocess to see if these parameters would correlate to TIMP-3\nusceptibility. The cell lines showed that there were differ-\nnces in the surface marker expression of Fas, (Fig. 1c),\nhereas TNF-R1 and the death receptor ligand Fas ligand\nxpression was detectable on less than 1% of cells for all\nines (not shown). The levels of intracellular p53 expression\nn each of the cell lines examined varied between each of the\nell lines examined (Fig. 1d). To examine the effects of TIMP-\non the growth of lung cancer cells we studied the adenovi-\n\nal delivery of TIMP-3 on the viability of the lung cancer cell\nines compared to AdCMVLuc and AdCMVTIMP-1 and -2. Using\nanual cell counts and crystal violet staining there was a\n\nignificant decrease in cell numbers in the A549 cell line fol-\nowing infection with AdCMVTIMP-3 at 24 h until 96 h (when\nll cells infected by AdCMVTIMP-3 were dead). There was\no significant effect of adenovirally delivered AdCMVTIMP-1\nr AdCMVTIMP-2 on the growth of A549 cells.

Of these other cell lines only the H1466 line\nhowed a consistent increase in Annexin V and PI, however,\ns noted this did not translate to a consistent net cell killing\nffect.\n\n.3. Bax and Bcl2 expression\n\nrevious studies have shown good correlation between West-\nrn blot (the \u2018\u2018gold standard\u2019\u2019) and flow cytometry for the\netection of these apoptosis related proteins [21]. The ele-\nation of Bax following transduction with AdCMVTIMP3 was\nonsistent with the increased level of apoptosis detected\nn the A549 cells. In the uninfected cells there were\n5.95 \u00b1 2.4% Bax positive cells, while the TIMP-3 treated\nells had 36.95 \u00b1 1.06% positive cells for Bax. AdCMVLuc,\ndCMVTIMP1 and AdCMVTIMP2 demonstrated 21 \u00b1 0.28%,\n2.05 \u00b1 5.02% and 14.14 \u00b1 1.06%, respectively (Fig. 3c). The\nhange in the ratio of the balance between pro-apoptotic\nax and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 indicates increased apoptosis.\nhe balance changed from 0.5 in uninfected cells and 0.49\nn cells infected with AdCMVLuc to 2.0 in cells infected with\ndCMVTIMP3 (Fig. 3d). This is consistent with activation of\nhe caspase apoptotic pathway and a consequent change in\nhe regulators of this pathway from the anti-apoptotic Bcl2\no the pro-apoptotic Bax.\n\nt\nd\nl\np\nd\n\no Bax expression following transduction with AdCMVTIMP-3 and\n\n.4. Cell surface recognition of apoptosis\n\n.4.1. Death receptor and ligand expression\nas, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 are members of the TNF super-\namily of receptors. Specific ligand binding activates death\neceptors and subsequently, the downstream signalling that\nauses cell death. Multiple caspase pathways are recruited\ny activated TNF receptors [22]. TNF-R1 has been shown\no direct its signalling toward either transcription or apop-\nosis [23]. Although TNF-R2 does not have a death recep-\nor domain, it may also have a role in apoptosis through\nNF-R1 [24,25] activation. The expression of TNF-R1 on\nells infected with AdCMVTIMP3 was 3.64 \u00b1 0.67%, com-\nared with 0.21 \u00b1 0.15% in uninfected cells and 0.9 \u00b1 0.5%\nn cells infected with AdCMVLuc. These levels are low\nut there is a significant increase (p < 0.004) following\ndCMVTIMP3 infection (Fig. 4a). The expression of Fas lig-\nnd following AdCMVTIMP3 infection was 4.66 \u00b1 1.07%. In\nninfected cells the expression was 0.62 \u00b1 0.21%, AdCMVLuc\n.31 \u00b1 0.43%, AdCMVTIMP1 0.71 \u00b1 0.22% and AdCMVTIMP2\n.08 \u00b1 0.35%. There is a small but significant increase in\nhe expression of Fas ligand following delivery of TIMP-\n\nto the A549 cells (p < 0.004) (Fig. 4b). Expression of\nNF-R2 on TIMP-3 infected cells was 3.41 \u00b1 0.37%, com-\nared with uninfected controls 1.04 \u00b1 0.05% and AdCMVLuc\niral controls 1.54 \u00b1 0.27%. As anticipated this expres-\nion is low but detectable (Fig. 4c). Metalloproteinases\nave significant role in the regulation of the cytoxicity\nf Fas ligand [26].

We thus proceeded\nto p53 inhibition studies in an effort to determine whether\nchanges in p53 function were involved in TIMP-3 mediated\napoptosis.\n\n3.5. Inhibitory experiments\n\nWe conducted inhibitory experiments to determine the rel-\native roles of Fas, caspase and p53 in the apoptotic process\ninitiated by TIMP-3. As previously discussed TIMP-3 has been\nshown to act via a Fas death domain dependent Type II\napoptotic pathway in melanoma cells [29]. The caspases are\ncentral to the development of apoptosis initiated by both\nthe intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. The demonstration\nof active caspases in cells transfected with TIMP-3 is con-\nsistent with involvement of the caspases in the apoptotic\nprocess initiated by TIMP-3. The addition of the pan-caspase\ninhibitor Z-VAD to the cells infected with TIMP-3 inhibited\nthe development of apoptosis up to 72 h, thus confirming\n\nthe pivotal role of caspases in the TIMP-3 apoptotic process\n(Fig. 5a).\n\nThe Fas inhibitor ZB-4 is a neutralising monoclonal anti-\nbody to Fas receptor that inhibits Fas receptor-mediated\n\nt\ns\ng\ni\n\nf TIMP-3 on A549 cells and (c) the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-\ufffd (p-a)\noes not significantly affect apoptosis induced by TIMP-3.\n\npoptosis. As expected A549 cells developed apoptosis\nollowing infection with TIMP-3 (65.1 \u00b1 2.8% positive for\nnnexin V and PI staining). There was no toxicity associ-\nted with the addition of ZB-4 to uninfected cells compared\no the standard viral control (18.07 \u00b1 3.7% v 14.7 \u00b1 2.7%).\nowever, the addition of ZB-4 to the TIMP-3 treated cells\n\nnhibited the development of apoptosis. Only 17.69 \u00b1 2.5%\nf these cells were positive for Annexin V and PI stain-\nng. This confirms the role of the Fas death receptor in\nhe transformation of the extrinsic apoptotic signal to the\nctivation of DISC and subsequent caspase activation fol-\nowing transduction of A549 cells with adenoviral TIMP-3\nFig. 5b).\n\nThe p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-\ufffd is a reversible inhibitor\nf p53 mediated apoptosis. It improves cell survival after\nenotoxic stresses. The effect of the UV light on the A549\nells was as anticipated. It caused almost 80% of the cells\no become apoptotic. Following the addition of the p53\nnhibitor, the number of cells induced by UV light to undergo\npoptosis was reduced by half. TIMP-3 initiated apoptosis in\n5.1 \u00b1 2.8% of cells and the addition of the p53 inhibitor did\nosis (Fig. 5c). The controls of uninfected and AdCMVLuc\nhowed results consistent with previous findings. This sug-\nests that the p53 pathway is not directly involved in the\nnitiation of apoptosis in A549 cells.\n\n\n\nK.M.

The slightly greater killing effect seen\nwith the conditioned media experiment possibly reflects the\ngreater lead time for TIMP-3 generation in that experiment\n\nFig. 6 (a) Bystander effects of cells infected with\nAdCMVTIMP-3 and mixed with uninfected cells at various\n% of infected cells as indicated.

It is possible that factors released by TIMP-\n-mediated cell death contributed to the net death effect,\nather than TIMP-3 alone, but the key finding was that it is\not necessary to achieve 100% transduction of target cells\no achieve efficient cell death.\n\n.7. AdCMVTIMP3 effect on subcutaneous tumours\nn nude mice\n\nhe effects of adenovirally delivered TIMP-3 were compared\no effects of TIMP-1, -2 and control virus AdCMVLuc. Subcu-\naneous A549 tumours were injected with PBS, AdCMVLuc\nnd AdCMVTIMP1, 2 and 3. Those tumours injected with\ndCMVTIMP3 showed significantly impaired growth when\nompared to PBS, AdCMVLuc, AdCMVTIMP1 or AdCMVTIMP2\nnjected tumours (Fig. 7). On completion of the tumour pro-\nocol at day 35 the animals were euthanised and the tumours\nnd livers extracted for examination. TUNEL analysis of the\numour sections was used to identify apoptotic cells within\nhe sections. Tumours injected with AdCMVTIMP3 had sig-\nificantly more apoptotic cells than tumours injected with\nBS, AdCMVLuc and either TIMP-1 or -2 (Fig. 8-1(a\u2014e)). H&E\ntaining and TUNEL assay was used to assess inflammation\nr apoptosis in the livers of animals given tail vein injec-\nions of adenoviral vectors. There were no significant dif-\nerences between the livers of those animals injected with\ndCMVTIMP3 and control animals. Serological examination\nf hepatic enzymes showed that there was no significant\nvidence of hepatic derangement in any of the groups.\n\n.8.

Our vector val-\nidation studies had shown that TIMP-3 was detectable in\nthe cell-matrix rather than freely in conditioned media.\nWe used two methods to determine the bystander effect\nof TIMP-3. Firstly, we infected cells then 24 h later (before\nsigns of toxicity) mixed these at various ratios with unin-\nfected cells. Secondly, we infected cells, then waited 72 h\n(at which time toxicity was apparent) then took the con-\nditioned medium from these and applied it to uninfected\ncells. We used standard cell counting techniques to deter-\nmine cell numbers on completion of the protocol. The mixed\ncultures containing the TIMP-3 infected cells were signifi-\ncantly affected by the presence of TIMP-3 transduced cells.\nIn fact almost all the cells were dead in all ratios examined\n(Fig. 6a). The addition of media containing 15% and 35% of\nthe TIMP-3 conditioned media resulted in the death of all\nthe uninfected cells.

Discussion\n\nThe development of cancer therapeutics based on modula-\ntion of MMP activity is a rational paradigm but as yet it has\nfailed to achieve significant meaningful clinical advances.\nGene-based approaches for MMP inhibition using TIMPs may\nhave several advantages over conventional pharmaceuti-\ncal approaches. The potential for high-level locoregional\nexpression of the therapeutic agent and the anti-tumour\nproperties of the TIMPs beyond MMP inhibition offer the\npotential of multifaceted therapeutic agents. A number of\ndisturbances in the TIMP/MMP relative ratios have been\n\ndescribed in lung cancer [30]. High levels of MMP expres-\nsion are found in non-small cell carcinoma [31]. The number\nof MMPs expressed tends to increase with increased tumour\nstage and the levels of individual MMPs tends to be higher\nwith advanced tumour stage [30]. Decreased TIMP-3 expres-\n\n(\n(\n[\na\na\n\nVTIMP-2 and (e) AdCMVTIMP-3. 3(a\u2014e) CD-31 expression within\nontrol, (b) PBS, (c) AdCMVTIMP-1, (d) AdCMVTIMP-2 and (e)\n\nion at the invasive front of human colon carcinomas sug-\nests that a regional loss of TIMP-3 may facilitate tumour\nnvasion and metastasis [14]. The delivery of TIMP-3 to can-\ner cells would allow restoration of the MMP/TIMP balance\nnd inhibit the effects of excessive MMP expression. TIMP-3\nelivery would offer other potential benefits independent\nf MMP inhibition such as the initiation of apoptosis and cell\neath in lung cancer cells, and the inhibition of angiogene-\nis.\n\nThe evaluation of TIMPs with respect to their role in can-\ner has lead to potentially conflicting results [16]. TIMP-1\nas been associated with increased survival of lymphoma\nell lines. It also has been shown to confer resistance to Fas\nigand dependent and independent apoptosis [32]. TIMP-2\nas been shown to promote apoptosis in an in vivo colorec-\nal cancer model [33], but, protects B16 melanoma cells\nrom apoptosis [34]. TIMP-4 can also instigate apoptosis\nn transformed cardiac fibroblasts but inhibits apoptosis in\numan breast cancer cells in vitro and mammary tumours\nn vivo [35]. Baker et al. [5] have previously demonstrated\nhat adenoviral gene delivery of TIMP-3 to melanoma cells\nnd vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo inhibits invasion\nnd induces apoptosis. The same group also demonstrated\nhat gene delivery of TIMP-3 inhibited the invasion of HeLa\n\nmoderately invasive cervical carcinoma cells) and HT1080\nfibrosarcoma cells) through artificial basement membranes\n18]. This phenomenon was also demonstrated by TIMPs 1\nnd 2 whereas the pro-apoptotic effect of TIMP-3 was unique\nnd was therefore the focus of the current study.

Questions of toxicity in normal organs, due\no the use of adenoviral vectors to deliver TIMP-3 have\not been addressed previously. We attempted to examine\nhis.\n\nTIMPs are known to have divergent effects on pro-\nrammed cell death [5], and the current series of investi-\nations demonstrates for the first time the ability of TIMP-3\nelivered via an adenoviral vector to induce apoptosis and\nell death in vitro in lung cancer cells. We have shown that\nverexpression of AdCMVTIMP3 effectively induces apoptosis\nnd causes cell death within 96 h of its delivery to A549 lung\nancer cell lines. This effect is not seen with either TIMP-1 or\n2. However, we found that the effect of TIMP-3-induced cell\nilling in vitro was rather limited, given that most of the cell\nines we tested were resistant to this effect. We attempted\no determine the basis for the variable susceptibility by look-\nng at levels of expression of various components of the\npoptosis pathway, as well as differences in the basic sus-\neptibility of the lines to infection with Ad, but no consistent\nifferences emerged. While we assessed death receptor lev-\nls and p53 levels, a more detailed analysis of functional\n53 status could provide more insight. Of note, A549 cells\nre known to have functional p53 [28]. Nevertheless, we did\not find any impact on TIMP-3 mediated apoptosis by p53\nnhibition. Variability in the susceptibility of tumour lines to\nIMP-3 has been noted by others [17]. Thus, for clinical util-\n\nty, some method for identifying those tumours likely to be\nusceptible would be preferable for optimal application of\nhis treatment strategy.\n\nMitochondria and cell surface receptors mediate the two\nain pathways of apoptosis [36]. The death receptors trans-\nuce the pro-apoptotic signal from the extracellular space\no the intracellular environment. Fas and TNF-R1 members\nf the TNF superfamily are among the best characterised\nf the death receptors [37,38]. Fas ligand is also a mem-\ner of the TNF family and is the principle ligand for Fas\n39]. The binding of Fas ligand to the receptor allows the\normation of death inducing signalling complex (DISC) by\nnducing clustering of Fas associated death domain (FADD),\naspase-8 and caspase-10. This results in proteolytic cleav-\nge of these caspases, release of the active proteases and\nubsequent activation of the downstream effector caspases\n37]. TNF-R2 does not contain a death domain motif but is\nhought to be able to signal apoptosis directly or through\nigand passing to TNF-R1 [40,41]. Exposure of metastatic\nelanoma cell lines to TIMP-3 results in stabilisation of\n\nhree distinct death receptors, TNF-R1, Fas and TRAIL-R1\nn cell surface and makes these cells more susceptible to\npoptosis induced by their respective ligands [14,42]. We\nave shown that treatment of A549 lung cancer cells, which\nave abundant expression of the Fas death receptor, with\n\nIMP-3 up-regulates the presence of Fas ligand, TNF-R1 and\nNF-R2 on the cell surface consistent with the significant\npoptosis induced by the delivery of TIMP-3 to these cells.\nimilar treatments with AdCMVTIMP1 and AdCMVTIMP2 did\not induce these changes.\n\ni\nF\ni\no\no\n\nK.M. Finan et al.\n\nA number of pharmaceutical inhibitors of MMPs (MMPIs)\nave been developed. Preclinical studies in experimen-\nal animal model systems demonstrated significant benefits\nrom the delivery of MMPIs in the form of reduced num-\ner of metastases and prolonged survival [43,44], although\nhese results have not yet translated to consistent benefits\nn human clinical trials. Importantly, we have shown that\nhe promising anti-tumour effects of TIMP-3 gene delivery\nn vitro can be translated into a therapeutic effect in vivo,\nor susceptible cells. Delivery of intra-tumoural AdCMVTIMP-\ninhibits the growth of pre-established subcutaneous A549\n\numours in Balb/c nude mice and this reduction in growth\ns related to an increase in apoptosis within these tumours.\nhere was no increase in toxicity as determined by both his-\nological examination of livers and examination of hepatic\nnzymes. Concurrent analysis of Balb/c nude mice treated\nith AdCMVTIMP-1 and -2 did not show evidence of a reduc-\n\nion in growth.\nThe anti-angiogenic effects of the TIMPs were initially\n\nostulated to be due to their MMP inhibitory abilities. How-\nver, it has been shown that each of the TIMPs 1\u20143 have\nMP independent mechanisms for inhibiting angiogenesis.\nIMP-1 has an influence on tumour progression through MMP\n\nnhibition, specifically MMP-9, and also by impairing angio-\nenesis thus restricting tumour growth and progression. It\nas also been shown to inhibit microvascular cell migra-\nion thus having a negative impact on tumour angiogene-\nis [45\u201448]. TIMP-2 has been shown to specifically inhibit\nngiogenesis via induction of MKP-1 leading to p38 MAPK\nathway inactivation [49]. TIMP-2 also inhibits the mito-\nenic response of human microvascular endothelial cells to\nrowth factors [50]. There has also been significant inves-\nigation into the mechanisms of TIMP-3 induced inhibition\nf angiogenesis. There is an effect exerted via MMP inhibi-\nion which could potentially lead to a positive or negative\nffect on angiogenesis. However, there is a net negative\nffect seen in the presence of TIMP-3 overexpression in both\nn vitro and in vivo experiments. The in vitro effects of\nIMP-3 on endothelial cell proliferation, migration and EC\nube formation have been documented by Anand-Apte et\nl. during their investigation into the role of TIMP-3 muta-\nions in the development of Sorsby\u2019s fundal dystrophy [51].\nt was demonstrated that TIMP-3 inhibited the chemotaxis\nf vascular endothelial cells toward vascular endothelial\nrowth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor\nbFGF) and inhibited the invasion of collagen gels, capil-\nary morphogenesis in vitro and also inhibited bFGF induced\nngiogenesis. Spurbeck et al. [52] demonstrated that retro-\niral gene delivery of TIMP-3 to murine neuroblastoma and\nelanoma tumour cells in vivo affected functional capillary\norphogenesis. In this model the endothelial cells did not\n\norm functional tubules. There was decreased expression\nf vascular endothelial (VE)\u2014cadherin by endothelial cells\nn the presence of TIMP-3. Further, the work of Qi et al.\n9] demonstrated that the ability of TIMP-3 to inhibit VEGF\nediated angiogenesis was mediated via the inhibition of\n\nhe binding of VEGF to VEGF receptor-2 and the subsequent\n\nnhibition of the downstream signalling and angiogenesis.\nurther investigations in animal studies have shown there\ns a decrease in vascular endothelial-cadherin expression\nn endothelial cells in the presence of increased levels\nf TIMP-3. This supports the concept that TIMP-3 overex-\n\n\n\ngen\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\nIn vitro susceptibility to the pro-apoptotic effects of TIMP-3\n\npression leads to failure of vascular integrity in tumours\n[52].\n\nAt present, TIMP-3 is emerging as the most attractive\nanti-tumour agent. It has shown promise in animal models of\nmalignant glioma and human leukaemia xenografts in mice\n[17,53]. It inhibits MMPs effectively, induces apoptosis in\ntumour cells and inhibits angiogenesis [5,18,54]. It is bound\nto the extracellular matrix and its ability to induce an effect\nbeyond the transduced cell is directly related to its local-\nisation here [55]. Clearly however, the therapeutic utility\nof TIMP-3 will not be universal, but for those tumours sus-\nceptible to the apoptosis-inducing effects, therapeutic gains\ncan be achieved over alternate TIMPs. Further vector devel-\nopment to enhance efficacy might increase the therapeutic\nvalue of this promising agent but better understanding of\nthe molecular basis of TIMP-3 susceptibility would help to\nbetter target this therapeutic approach.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nFinancial support: Grants from the Cancer Council of\nAustralia, Australian Lung Foundation, Medical Research\nand Compensation Foundation, National Health and Medi-\ncal Research Council and the University of Adelaide.
