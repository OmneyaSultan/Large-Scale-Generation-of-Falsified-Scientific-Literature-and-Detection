Safaya).\na b s t r a c t\n\nVascular endothelial growth inhibitor TNFSF15 (TL1A), a ligand for TNFRSF25 (DR3) and decoy receptor\nTNFRSF6B (DcR3), is expressed in human pulmonary arterial (HPAEC) and lung microvascular (HMVEC)\nendothelial cells where it might modulate inflammation and sickle vasculopathy. Pulmonary disease,\nendothelial abnormalities and inflammation are prominent features of sickle cell disease (SCD). Butyrate\nhas opposing effects on endogenous TNFSF15 expression in pulmonary endothelium, acting as an inhib-\nitor in HPAEC and an inducer in HMVEC. Similar effects were observed with a known cytokine TNF-a in\nthese two cell types. Furthermore the TNFSF15 promoter utilized different combinations of cis-elements\nfor its expression in these two cell types. AP1-like and G-rich sequence elements were critical for pro-\nmoter activity in large vessel HPAEC while AP1-like and NF-jB consensus sequence elements were\nrequired in small vessel HMVEC. The requirement of an NF-jB sequence element by the TNFSF15 pro-\nmoter in HMVEC but not in HPAEC supported the notion that HMVEC might be a target of inflammation\nand vasoocclusion in SCD. The dual effects of butyrate-dependant TNFSF15 regulation in lung endothe-\nlium may help in identify inflammatory pathways and understand the role of HMVEC in pathogenesis\nof vasoocclusion in SCD.\n\n\ufffd 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nModifications of the endothelial cell (EC) phenotype can occur\nafter exposure to sickle erythrocytes (RBCs) and/or plasma [1,2].\nExposure of cultured bovine, human pulmonary artery, or human\nlung microvascular endothelial cells (BPAEC, HPAEC and HMVEC)\nto plasma taken from SCD patients during the acute chest syn-\ndrome resulted in up-regulation of mRNA expression of the vaso-\nconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) and dysregulation of nitric oxide\n(NO) metabolism [1,3]. Exposure of EC to RBCs from SCD patients\nwithout a recent acute vasoocclusive event (steady-state) induced\nexpression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and\nintercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [2]. These data suggest\na role for chronic inflammation in sickle vasoocclusion as altera-\ntions in the EC phenotype occurred upon exposure to blood com-\nponents from SCD patients even when they appeared clinically\nwell. TNFSF15 encodes a cytokine belonging to the tumor necrosis\nfactor ligand family that is predominantly expressed on endothe-\nlial cells and functions as an autocrine cytokine, inhibiting angio-\ngenesis, cell proliferation, and tumor growth as well as\nll rights reserved.\nstabilizing the vasculature [4]. This cytokine plays a role in the\ninduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix\ndegrading enzymes in atherogenesis [5]. Its expression is up-regu-\nlated in inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting a role in inflam-\nmation [6,7]. It also functions as a T-cell co-stimulator leading to\nincreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines [8].\n\nSickle vasculopathy is, at least in part, a result of endothelial\ndamage and inflammation. Perturbation of the microvascular\nendothelium, because of its important role in inflammation and\nmaintenance of vascular tone, may play a role in sickle vasoocclu-\nsion [9,10]. EC activation may differ between large vessels and the\nmicrovasculature; this heterogeneity could be a factor in the path-\nophysiology of diseases across different vascular beds. In earlier\nstudies, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used\nfor endothelial cell activation studies, but concerns about EC heter-\nogeneity makes this cell type less suitable to study pulmonary\ncomplications of SCD. Since much of vasoocclusion occurs at the le-\nvel of microvasculature, we hypothesized that the pulmonary\nmicrovascular endothelium could be a primary target for cytokines\nduring the acute chest syndrome and possibly other types of sickle\ncell lung disease.\n\nSodium butyrate and similar compounds can induce fetal hemo-\nglobin expression in SCD and these agents might be therapeutically\n\nmailto:ssafaya@bu.edu\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\nS. Safaya et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 72\u201378 73\nuseful [11,12]. Butyrate is also known to modulate gene expres-\nsion in the endothelium. In HUVEC, exposure to butyrate in-\nduced expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin and endothelin-1 [13].\nSodium phenyl butyrate increased VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expres-\nsion while down-regulating ET-1 in transformed human bone\nmarrow endothelial cells [14]. Butyrate\u2019s effects are not re-\nstricted to the endothelium as it is also known to suppress\npro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes [15]. These studies\nsuggest that butyrate could potentially act as an immune modu-\nlator in endothelial cells. In the present study, we examined the\neffects of butyrate on TNFSF15 expression in HPAEC and HMVEC\nwhile comparing these effects to those of another known im-\nmune modulator, TNF-a. This study may provide new insights\ninto the role of TNFSF15 in inflammation within microvascular\nendothelium.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cell cultures\n\nHPAEC and HMVEC (passage 6\u20139) were grown in EGM-2 and\nEGM-2 MV media supplemented with growth factors and 10%\nfetal bovine serum (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) under humidi-\nfied conditions (5% CO2) at 37 \ufffdC. Sodium butyrate, 4 mM (Sig-\nma\u2013Aldrich, USA) or recombinant human TNF-a, 40 ng/ml\n(Millipore Corp., Temecula, CA) was added directly to the med-\nia. For experiments involving endogenous TNFSF15 expression,\ncells were incubated in presence of butyrate or TNF-a for 20,\n40 min or 1, 2, 6 or 24 h. At the end of each incubation period,\nthe cells were washed with PBS and lysed for RNA and protein\nisolation.\n\n2.2. RNA isolation and RT-PCR assay\n\nTotal RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen,\nValencia, CA) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). DNA\nfree RNA (0.25 lg) was used as the template for one-step RT-PCR\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The forward and reverse primers used\nwere: (a) TNFSF15\u201450-ATGGGCCGAGGATCTGGGACTGAGC-30 and\n5\u2018-CTATAGTAAGAAGGTTTTATCTTC-30 (750 bp fragment); (b) TL1-\n5\u2018-GCAAAGTCTACAGTTTCCCAATGAGAAAATTAATCC-30 and the\nsame reverse primer as used for TNFSF15 (522 bp fragment); (c)\nGAPDH\u20145\u2018-ATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTG-30 and 5\u2018-CATACCAGGAA\nATGAGCTGG-30 (177 bp fragment). The following conditions were\nused: initial incubation, 30 min (53 \ufffdC), 2 min (94 \ufffdC), 40 s dena-\nturation (94 \ufffdC), 40 s annealing (55 \ufffdC) and 1 min elongation\n(68 \ufffdC) for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR products were run on\n1.5% agarose gels and bands were visualized. Relative levels of\nTNFSF15 RNA expression were obtained from densitometry analy-\nsis; the intensity of the TNFSF15 RT-PCR band was divided by the\ncorresponding GAPDH band and the values obtained were plotted\nagainst each time point. Densitometry image analysis was done by\nusing software available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/. Each experi-\nment was performed in triplicate.\n\n2.3. Western blot analysis of TNFSF15 protein\n\nHPAEC and HMVEC were plated and incubated in the presence\nof butyrate (4 mM) or TNF-a (40 ng/ml) for 20, 40 min, 1, 2, 6 or\n24 h. Following incubation, cells were washed with PBS and lysed\nin RIPA buffer containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors [16]. The\nlysate was cleared of cellular debris, protein concentration was\ndetermined by using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercu-\nles, CA) and samples (40 lg) loaded onto a 10% SDS\u2013PAGE gel.\nGel-fractionated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose\nmembrane and blotted with an anti-human TL1A primary antibody\nraised against human TNFSF15 peptide (1:200 dilution) (Biolegend,\nSan Diego, CA), followed by a goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP secondary\nantibody (1:5000 dilution). Bound antibody was detected via an\nenhanced chemiluminescence fluorography reagent kit (Western\nlightning chemiluminescence reagent, Perkin Elmer, USA). Use of\nan anti-tubulin goat anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, San-\nta Cruz, CA) served as an internal control for these experiments.\nRelative levels of TNFSF15 protein were determined via densitom-\netry and corrected for tubulin expression. Each experiment was\nperformed in triplicate.\n\n2.4. Reporter plasmid constructs\n\nHPAEC DNA was used to amplify the TNFSF15 promoter, a 1417\nbase pair fragment (\ufffd1390/+27 from initiation site, ref Gene\nNM_005118). The forward and reverse primers used were 50-\nTCCAGGCTGTGACATAACCA-30 and 50-CAAAGCTCAGTCCCAGATCC-30.\nThe amplified product was cloned into p-GEM-T Easy vector (Pro-\nmega, Madison, WI), releasing the insert with Not1 and end-filling\nthe fragment. The excised and end-filled fragment was cloned into\nthe basic pGL3 (Promega) luciferase reporter vector at the Sma1\nsite in the multi-cloning site. The promoter orientation was con-\nfirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. A series of\n50-end deletion constructs of the TNFSF15 promoter were gener-\nated. The deleted constructs were designated: p-89-luc, p-188-luc,\np-444-luc, p-540-luc, p-912-luc, p-1056-luc, p-1228-luc and p-\n1390-luc.\n\nIn the p-188-luc and p-444-luc constructs, we identified a mod-\nification of the classic AP1 site with 80% homology; this sequence\nelement was designated as AP1-like motif. The G-rich, AP1-like and\nNF-jB binding sequences were mutated individually and in combi-\nnation (described in Fig. 4), using the Quick change multi-site-di-\nrected PCR based mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). These\nmutations in consensus AP1 and NF-jB sequences have previously\nbeen reported to abolish the functional activity of these sequence\nelements [17\u201319]. All the mutant constructs were confirmed by\nsequencing. Plasmids constructs were purified (Qiagen plasmid\nkit) before electroporation into the endothelial cells.\n\n2.5. Cell transfection and luciferase assay\n\nHPAEC and HMVEC were grown to a density of 1.5 \ufffd 106 cells\nper 100 \ufffd 15 mm plate, washed with PBS, trypsinized, centrifuged,\nand resuspended in media containing 10% FBS. A total of 1.25\u2013\n1.5 \ufffd 106 cells were transfected with 12 lg of pGL-3 basic lucifer-\nase reporter plasmid linked to various constructs of the TNFSF15\npromoter and 0.14 lg of pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase (85:1 dilution)\nas an internal control reporter, in a final volume of 400 ll. Reporter\nplasmids and cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and electropo-\nrated (Bio-Rad Electroporator) at 200 V/975 lF for HPAEC and at\n180 V/950 lF for HMVEC in a 0.4 cm cuvette. Three electropora-\ntions were performed for each plasmid. After electroporation, cells\nwere allowed to recover for 10 min at room temperature, pooled\nand equal volumes were placed into 6 or 24 well culture plates\nwith 1\u20132 ml of media per well. In the preliminary promoter trans-\nfections studies, the luciferase activity was monitored up to 48 h.\nThe promoter activity was found to peak at 6\u20138 h after transfec-\ntion; hence 6 h of incubation time was selected for all transfection\nstudies. At the end of incubation period, media was aspirated; cells\nwere washed with PBS, lysed and assayed for luciferase activity\nusing a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison,\nWI) and a Bio-Rad Luminometer. Results presented as RLU, a ratio\nof pGL-3 promoter construct firefly luciferase values to the Renilla\nluciferase internal control.\n\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/\n\n\n74 S.

Results\n\n3.1. Effect of butyrate on endogenous TNFSF15 expression\n\nThe expression pattern of TNFSF15 in HPAEC and HMVEC was\nstudied using RT-PCR and Western analysis. The ECs were incu-\nbated in presence or absence of butyrate (4 mM) for 20 or\n40 min or 1, 2, 6 or 24 h and at the end of each incubation period,\nRNA and protein were isolated. Using TNFSF15 gene specific prim-\ners, a 750 bp fragment was amplified in both cell types, and is ex-\npressed at high levels in HPAEC when compared to HMVEC\n(Fig. 1A, lane C). The presence of this fragment was indicative of\nfull length TNFSF15 transcript. This transcript is a longer variant\nof TL1/VEGI, a protein with antiangiogenic activity. When TL1 spe-\ncific primers were used, no amplified product of this transcript\n(522 bp) was detected in either cell types (data not shown). This\nobservation suggests that TNFSF15 (TL1A) is predominantly ex-\npressed in the two pulmonary endothelial cell types studied. Using\na TNFSF15 specific antibody, a 31 kDa band corresponding to\nTNFSF15 (TL1A) protein in both cell types was detected and base-\nline protein expression was higher in HPAEC as compared to\nHMVEC (Fig. 1B, lane C).\n\nNext the effect of sodium butyrate on TNFSF15 RNA and protein\nexpression in these two cell types was investigated. Butyrate\u2019s ef-\nfects on gene expression were observed after 20 min of exposure\nin both HPAEC and HMVEC. In HPAEC, butyrate inhibited RNA\nexpression of after 20 min of exposure; this inhibitory effect\nTNF\n\nTub\n\nTN\nFS\n\nF1\n5/\n\nG\nA\n\nP\nD\n\nH\nTN\n\nFS\nF1\n\n5/\nTu\n\nbu\nlin\n\n0 .0\n0 .2\n0 .4\n0 .6\n0 .8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n\n0 .0\n0 .5\n1.0\n1.5\n2 .0\n2 .5\n3 .0\n\n*\n\n*\n\nC     20 40 rh42621\n\nA RNA Expression in     CEAPH\nTNFS\n\nGAPD\n\nB     Protein  Expressionin   HPAEC\n\nC    20 40 1       2      6      24 hr\n\nFig. 1.

In HMVEC, co-incubation\nwith butyrate for 20 min induced RNA expression and this effect\npersisted up to 24 h. The effect of butyrate on TNFSF15 expression\nwas more robust in HMVEC as compared to HPAEC. The effect of\nbutyrate on gene expression was also observed at the protein le-\nvel in these two cell types and followed a similar time course\n(*p < .05); (Fig. 1A and B).\n\n3.2. Effect of TNF-a on endogenous TNFSF15 expression\n\nCo-incubating HPAEC and HMVEC with TNF-a (40 ng/ml) pro-\nduced effects on TNFSF15 expression similar to those observed with\nbutyrate. In HPAEC, TNFSF15 RNA and protein expression was inhib-\nited after 20 min, while in HMVEC, expression was induced at\n20 min and continued to be higher up to 24 h of incubation\n(*p < .05) (Fig. 2A and B). These data suggest that TNF-a and butyrate\nhave similar effects on TNFSF15 expression in these two cell types.\n\n3.3. Identification of TNFSF15 minimal functional promoter element in\nHPAEC and HMVEC\n\nHaving established a differential effect of butyrate on endoge-\nnous TNFSF15 expression in HPAEC and HMVEC, our next step\nwas to investigate whether this effect could be attributed to the\nuse of different sequence elements within the TNFSF15 promoter\n(\ufffd1390/+27). For this purpose, a series of 50-deletion constructs\nof the TNFSF15 promoter were generated (Fig. 3A).\n\nIn HPAEC, the promoter region sufficient for minimal promoter\nactivity was identified between the \ufffd89 and \ufffd188 nucleotides, 50\nto the initiation codon (p-188-luc). Other promoter deletion con-\nstructs, p-444-luc, p-540-luc, p-912-luc, p-1056-luc and p-1228-luc\nexhibited higher activity than either p-188-luc or p-1390/+27-luc,\nsuggesting the presence of some activator sequences located be-\ntween 50 to p-188-luc and p-1390-luc.

These promoter constructs along with the control plasmid pRL-\nSV40 were electroporated into HPAEC (B) and HMVEC (C) and incubated for 6 h. At the end of incubation period, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase\nactivity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity encoded by co-transfected pRL-SV40 control plasmid, mean luciferase activity expressed as relative luciferase units (RLU)\nis presented (n = 3). The p-188-luc and p-1390-luc promoters have higher activity than the p-89-luc promoter in HPAEC (*p < 0.01). In HMVEC, p-444-luc and p-1390-luc\npromoter activity was significantly higher than the p-188-luc promoter (**p < 0.05).\n\nS. Safaya et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 72\u201378 75\n\n\n\n76 S.

These results indi-\ncate the presence of critical minimal regulatory elements in p-188-\nluc, essential for its expression in HPAEC.\n\nThese p-1390-luc deletion constructs were also tested in\nHMVEC, p-188-luc exhibited little activity, implying that p-188-\nluc does not have all of the required sequence elements necessary\nfor its expression in HMVEC. Nevertheless, the p-444-luc construct\nactivity was comparable to that of p-1390-luc in HMVEC, suggest-\ning that p-444-luc is the essential minimal promoter functional in\nHMVEC (Fig. 3C). From these observations, it is reasonable to con-\nclude that the TNFSF15 promoter utilizes different promoter se-\nquences for its expression in HPAEC and HMVEC.\n\n3.4.

The sequence motifs and\nAP1-like and G-rich sequence in modulating p-188-luc construct\nactivity was tested by mutating core nucleotide bases in these se-\nquence elements (G-rich, AP1 and G-AP1 mutant constructs). The\np-188-luc-AP1 mutant has significantly decreased activity and\nG-rich sequence alteration also reduced the promoter activity;\nmutations in the G-rich region also partially abolished the MFZ1\nelement (NGNGGGGA) located 50 to the putative G-rich element.\nWhen both AP1-like and G-rich elements were mutated in p-188-\nluc, the inhibition was greater than with either mutated sequence\nelement alone, suggesting a synergistic effect. Based on these re-\nsults, it appears that both the G-rich and AP1-like sequences have\ncritical roles in regulating the TNFSF15 promoter expression in\nHPAEC (Fig. 4A). Another consensus AP1-like binding site exists\nat \ufffd34 to \ufffd26 region in the construct p-89-luc, but since this pro-\nmoter construct has little functional activity, this sequence is unli-\nkely to contribute to the TNFSF15 promoter activity.\n\n3.5.

Safaya et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 72\u201378 77\nconstruct is not sufficient to allow its expression in HMVEC. It is\nlikely that sequences 50 to the p-188-luc region are critical to its\nexpression in this cell type. A sequence motif search in this region\nled to identification of a NF-jB sequence in p-444-luc (\ufffd314 to\n\ufffd305 region). Altering this NF-jB sequence significantly reduced\np-444-luc construct expression in HMVEC. Although G-rich and\nAP1-like sequence mutants also reduce the p-444-luc activity, these\ntwo sequence motifs alone can not drive the promoter in the absence\nof NF-jB element. Furthermore, altering both AP1-like and NF-jB\nsequence elements in p-444-luc did not produce a significant change\nin promoter activity compared with mutation of the NF-jB site alone\n(Fig. 4B). However, altering NF-jB sequence in p-444-luc did not in-\nhibit its activity in HPAEC, but altering both AP1-like and NF-jB ele-\nments inhibited activity and produced effects similar to altering the\nAP1-like sequence element (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these observa-\ntions imply that, in HMVEC, even though AP1-like and G-rich se-\nquence elements may play a role, the presence of NF-jB sequence\nelement is critical for TNFSF15 promoter activity. Conversely, in\nHPAEC, the AP1-like sequence element and not the NF-jB site is re-\nquired for TNFSF15 minimal promoter activity.\n4. Discussion\n\nOur goal was to explore the expression pattern of TNFSF15 in\nHPAEC and HMVEC and define the effects of butyrate or TNF-a\non its expression. Induction of TNFSF15 has been associated with\ninflammation, one of the proposed mediators of sickle vasoocclu-\nsion [6\u20138]. The existence of heterogeneity in endogenous TNFSF15\nexpression among endothelial cell types suggests that differential\neffects on expression may be induced by butyrate. Vasoocclusive\nepisodes and hemolytic anemia are hallmarks of the pathophysiol-\nogy of SCD; the acute chest syndrome and pulmonary hypertension\nare prominent examples of vasoocclusive and hemolysis-related\ncomplications, respectively. The endothelium appears to play a role\nin the pathogenesis of these major pulmonary complications of\nSCD. Because of this, we choose to extend previous studies cen-\ntered on other vascular beds to an evaluation of the major endo-\nthelial cell types within the lung, HPAEC and HMVEC. These\nresults suggest that TNFSF15 could play a role in vasoocclusion\nwithin the pulmonary vasculature.\n\nEndogenous TNFSF15 expression at the base line was higher in\nHPAEC compared with HMVEC, supporting the notion that expres-\nsion is heterogeneous among cell types. Moreover, co-incubation\nwith either butyrate or TNF-a produced differing effects on\nTNFSF15 expression in these two cell types, even though the down-\nstream effects were similar with butyrate in both. Butyrate or TNF-\na inhibited TNFSF15 RNA and protein expression in HPAEC, indicat-\ning a possible anti-inflammatory role of these two agents in large\nvessel endothelium. In contrast, the induction of TNFSF15 RNA\nand protein expression in HMVEC by butyrate or TNF-a suggested\na pro-inflammatory role of these agents in small vessel endothe-\nlium. We have not investigated the mechanism of butyrate\u2019s effects\non TNFSF15 expression in these endothelial cell types. Butyrate has\nbeen reported to regulate gene expression via the AP1 binding se-\nquences and histone acetylation [20] SP1/SP3 multi-protein inter-\nactions [21,22], a CRE motif [23], interaction with NF-jB signal\ntransduction pathway [24] and inhibition of histone deacetylase\n[25]. We found that TNFSF15 gene can be either induced or re-\npressed in response to butyrate, depending upon the cell type\nstudied.\n\nAlthough the mechanisms for the TNFSF15 response to butyrate\nor TNF-a in these two lung EC types is not clear, it might relate to\nthe selective use of promoter sequence elements as suggested by\nour promoter deletion studies. It would of interest to establish\nwhether the TNFSF15 promoter uses the same or different cis-ele-\nments to regulate the gene expression in the two pulmonary endo-\nthelial cell types and this might help in understanding the\nmechanism of the differential effects of butyrate. To begin to ad-\ndress the mechanism responsible for the regulation of TNFSF15\nexpression, we identified different regions of the TNFSF15 promoter\nthat are critical for gene expression in each cell type. The minimal\npromoter construct p-188-luc was functional in HPAEC but not in\nHMVEC; altering the core AP1-like sequence element along with\nG-rich sequence in p-188-luc eliminated most of the activity of this\nconstruct. This minimal promoter has two putative AP1-like and\none G-rich sequences, but only one of these AP1-like sequence ele-\nments (\ufffd102 to \ufffd92) contributed to the minimal promoter activ-\nity. The NF-jB sequence element (\ufffd314 to \ufffd305) did not appear\nto be essential for minimal promoter activity in HPAEC as its dele-\ntion in p-188-luc or alteration in p-444-luc, respectively, did not af-\nfect the activity. In HMVEC, the promoter construct p-444-luc was\nfunctional and its activity appeared to be due to the NF-jB se-\nquence element present in this construct. The G-rich and AP1-like\nsequence elements do appear to exert additional effects on pro-\nmoter activity. These results suggest that NF-jB, possibly in tan-\ndem with AP1-like sequence elements, drive the TNFSF15\npromoter in HMVEC. Interestingly, this NF-jB sequence element\nwas also critical for TNFSF15 activity in murine cerebral endothelial\ncells suggesting an overlap with other endothelial cell types [26].\n\nThe use of an NF-jB sequence motif by the TNFSF15 promoter in\nHMVEC, and its pro-inflammatory response to butyrate suggests\nthat HMVEC are a target of inflammation as NF-jB is a key tran-\nscription factor in the inflammatory response [27]. Moreover, the\nrecent description of TNFSF15 as a critical gene in gut inflammation\n[7] supports the notion that HMVEC are targets of inflammation\nand that TNFSF15 might play an important role in this process.\nHence, TNFSF15 up-regulation in lung microvascular endothelium\ncould provide a pro-inflammatory milieu favoring SCD vasoocclu-\nsion. During vasoocclusion, the endothelium in SCD becomes\npro-inflammatory via the up-regulation of adhesion molecules\n[28,29]. Endothelial activation can occur in this setting by a variety\nof mechanisms. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a can be\nreleased by circulating monocytes and activate the endothelium\n[30]. Low oxygen tension within the vasculature results in HbS\npolymerization, adherence of sickle cells to the vascular endothe-\nlium and microvasculature occlusion [31,32]. Co-incubation of\nsickle erythrocytes with HPAEC resulted in up-regulation of the\nadhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 [2], suggesting a role\nfor the sickle erythrocyte in the modulation of inflammation. Leu-\nkocyte and platelet adherence to the endothelium also occur and\nmight further enhance this process [33\u201335]. Abnormal interactions\nbetween sickle erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets with the\nendothelium could trigger the expression of cytokines such as\nTNFSF15 that can activate or inactivate genes essential for normal\nendothelial function. The observation of a pro-inflammatory re-\nsponse to butyrate in HMVEC raises the possibility that pharmaco-\nlogical use of this agent to induce fetal hemoglobin might\nparadoxically perturb the endothelium.\n\nWe show that both butyrate and TNF-a produce differential ef-\nfects on TNFSF15 expression in HPAEC and HMVEC. The induction\nof TNFSF15 gene expression in HMVEC by butyrate suggests that\nup-regulation of this gene could produce a pro-inflammatory envi-\nronment that might contribute to the pathogenesis of sickle\nvasoocclusion.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Dr. Douglas V.
