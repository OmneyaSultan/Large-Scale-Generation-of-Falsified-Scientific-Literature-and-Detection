Carson, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, and approved November 8, 2013 (received for review October 15, 2013)\n\nExpression of receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM),\na breast cancer susceptibility gene, is tightly controlled in normal\ntissues but elevated in many tumors, contributing to tumorigenesis\nand metastases. However, how the expression of RHAMM is regu-\nlated remains elusive. Statins, inhibitors of mevalonate metabolic\npathway widely used for hypercholesterolemia, have been found\nto also have antitumor effects, but little is known of the specific\ntargets and mechanisms. Moreover, Hippo signaling pathway plays\ncrucial roles in organ size control and cancer development, yet its\ndownstream transcriptional targets remain obscure. Here we show\nthat RHAMM expression is regulated by mevalonate and Hippo\npathways converging onto Yes-associated protein (YAP)/TEAD,\nwhich binds RHAMM promoter at specific sites and controls its\ntranscription and consequently breast cancer cell migration and\ninvasion (BCCMI); and that simvastatin inhibits BCCMI via targeting\nYAP-mediated RHAMM transcription. Required for ERK phosphor-\nylation and BCCMI, YAP-activated RHAMM transcription is depen-\ndent on mevalonate and sensitive to simvastatin, which modulate\nRHAMM transcription by modulating YAP phosphorylation and nu-\nclear-cytoplasmic localization. Further, modulation by mevalonate/\nsimvastatin of YAP-activated RHAMM transcription requires gera-\nnylgeranylation, Rho GTPase activation, and actin cytoskeleton\nrearrangement, but is largely independent of MST and LATS kinase\nactivity. These findings from in vitro and in vivo investigations link\nmevalonate and Hippo pathways with RHAMM as a downstream\neffector, a YAP-transcription and simvastatin-inhibition target, and\na cancer metastasis mediator; uncover a mechanism regulating\nRHAMM expression and cancer metastases; and reveal a mode\nwhereby simvastatin exerts anticancer effects; providing potential\ntargets for cancer therapeutic agents.\n\nmetabolism | actin assembly | oncogene | tumor suppressor | crosstalk\n\nBreast cancer is by far the most frequent cancer in womenworldwide, ranking second among all cancers, and is one\nof the most deadly cancers (1). Unraveling the molecular and\ncellular mechanisms underlying breast cancer progression and\nmetastasis is critical for development of therapeutic agents\nto treat this deadly disease. Receptor for hyaluronan (HA)-\nmediated motility (RHAMM), also known as HMMR, IHABP,\nor CD168, has been identified as a breast cancer susceptibility\ngene (2, 3), with dual oncogenic functions as HA receptor and\nmitotic spindle binding protein (4, 5). RHAMM is generally not\ndetected in homeostatic tissues, and is transiently produced during\nwound repair, but its hyperexpression is associated with tumor\ndevelopment, progression, and metastasis (2, 6). Overexpression of\nRHAMM causes transformation and promotes breast cancer cell\nmigration and invasion (BCCMI), and its expression is up-regu-\nlated in a variety of human tumors, including breast and endo-\nmetrial carcinomas (6\u20138), gastrointestinal cancers (9, 10), prostate\n\ncancer (11), aggressive fibromatosis (i.e., desmoid tumor) (12), lung\nand liver cancer (13, 14), glioma (15), and B-cell malignancies (16,\n17). RHAMM binds to mitotic spindles and promotes interphase\nmicrotubule instability and mitotic spindle integrity (18, 19).\nUniquely, it is also unconventionally exported onto extracellular\nsurface to partner with CD44, thereby enhancing CD44-mediated\ntumor progression via ERK1/2 association, and maintaining high\nproliferative activities and motility of invasive cancer cells (20,\n21). Thus, expression of RHAMM is critical for its normal and\noncogenic functions, but how it is regulated remains obscure.\nStatins are specific inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl\n\nCoA reductase (HMGCR), the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting,\nmevalonate-making step in the mevalonate pathway for the bio-\nsynthesis of isoprenoids and downstream products. The mevalonate\npathway is biologically very important because the isoprenoids it\nproduces play vital roles in multiple cellular functions, including\nprotein posttranslational modifications such as geranylgeranylation\n\nSignificance\n\nHow receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) ex-\npression is regulated, how statins exert anticancer effects, and\nwhat roles mevalonate and Hippo pathways play in tumors are\nimportant issues in cancer biology. We find that the two\npathways converge onto Yes-associated protein (YAP)/TEAD to\ncontrol RHAMM transcription leading to ERK activation and\ncancer metastasis, which is inhibited by simvastatin. YAP/TEAD\nbinds RHAMM promoter at specific sites to activate RHAMM\ntranscription, and mevalonate/simvastatin affects RHAMM\ntranscription by modulating YAP phosphorylation and nuclear-\ncytoplasmic distribution. These in vitro and in vivo findings\nidentify a mechanism regulating RHAMM expression and can-\ncer metastasis wherein RHAMM is a downstream effector of\nmevalonate/Hippo pathways, and a YAP/TEAD-transcription\nand simvastatin-inhibition target, revealing interesting in-\nterplay of the pathways and potential targets for cancer\ntherapeutic agents.\n\nAuthor contributions: Z.W., Y.W., and L.H. designed research; Z.W., Y.W., H.W., Y.

As potent block-\ners of the mevalonate pathway and biosynthesis of cholesterol,\nstatins have long been used to treat hypercholesterolemia and\nprevent cardiovascular diseases (22). Remarkably, statins have\nrecently been found to also have multiple anticancer effects such\nas antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiinvasive, and radiosensitizing\nproperties, making them promising therapeutic agents against many\ncancers, including mammary carcinoma (22, 23). Several potential\nmechanisms have been suggested to explain the anticancer activities\nof statins. Statins could trigger tumor-specific apoptosis by blocking\nprotein geranylgeranylation, leading to disrupted membrane local-\nization and function of the Ras superfamily including CDC42 and\nRac and Rho GTPase (22, 23), as well as disorganization of\nactin stress fibers (24). Simvastatin was shown to foster en-\nhanced expression of mutant p53 to down-regulate CD44 ex-\npression, therefore preventing breast cancer cell metastasis to\nbone (25). Furthermore, simvastatin inactivated NF-\u03baB, leading to\nderepression of PTEN and repression of Bcl-xl to prevent breast\ncancer cell growth (26). Notably, it was recently demonstrated that\nthe mevalonate pathway is necessary and sufficient to maintain\nthe malignant state of breast cancer cells in 3D culture (27).\n\nHowever, specific antitumor targets and mechanisms of statins\nare poorly understood.\nThe Hippo pathway, with the transcriptional coactivator Yes-\n\nassociated protein (YAP) as its downstream effector, is highly\nconserved from Drosophila to mammals and critical in controlling\norgan size, tissue regeneration, and stem cell self-renewal (28,\n29). Recently, the Hippo\u2013YAP pathway has been demonstrated\nto be involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression (30, 31).\nRegulated by cell density, shape, and actin cytoskeleton, the\nmammalian Hippo pathway consists of a core kinase cascade in\nwhich Mst1 or Mst2 forms a complex with the adaptor protein\nWW45 and phosphorylates the LATS1/2 kinases and another\nadaptor protein MOB (32\u201334). The LATS/MOB complex sub-\nsequently phosphorylates YAP (at Ser127) and its paralog TAZ\n(at Ser89), leading to their cytoplasmic retention and repression\n(28, 30, 35). YAP protein level and activity are regulated at\nmultiple levels by several additional regulators, including the\nFERM domain proteins Merlin/NF2 (neurofibromatosis 2) and\nFRMD6 and protein phosphatases PP2A and ASPP1 (28, 30, 35).\nYAP can promote metastasis through interacting with the TEAD/\nTEF transcription factors, and increased YAP/TEAD activity\nplays a causal role in cancer progression and metastasis (36).\nYAP has been demonstrated as a driving oncogene on amplicon\n11q22, which is amplified in several human tumors (37). Up-\nregulation of YAP and its nuclear localization strongly correlate\nwith poor prognosis and tumor progression in multiple cancers,\nincluding breast (38), lung, colorectal, ovarian, and liver carci-\nnomas (39). Overexpression of YAP in a conditional YAP\ntransgenic mouse model led to tissue overgrowth and tumor-\nigenesis (40). Furthermore, mutation or epigenetic silencing\nof several components of the Hippo pathway, including NF2,\nLATS1/2, MST1/2, WW45, MOB, and KIBRA, have been\nassociated with several human cancers (30, 35, 41). Together, these\nstudies highlight a pivotal role of the Hippo\u2013YAP pathway in\ncancer development and progression, but the transcriptional tar-\ngets remain unclear. Moreover, it is unknown how the roles of the\nHippo pathway, mevalonate pathway, statin action, and RHAMM\nare related in tumor development and progression.\nThus, how the expression of the oncogene RHAMM is regulated,\n\nwhether and how the mevalonate metabolic pathway and Hippo\nsignaling pathway interact in cancer metastasis, and how the statin\ndrugs exert anticancer effects are important outstanding issues in\ncancer biology and therapy. In the present study, we have sought to\naddress these and related issues in the context of breast cancer. We\nhave focused on molecular and cellular investigations by using\na couple of highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines and a nontumor\ncell line, and conducted selective and relevant in vivo investigations\nwith human breast tumor tissues and its xenografts mouse model, as\nprevious animal model studies had established that the metastasis of\nbreast cancer was inhibited by simvastatin (25). We find that the\nmevalonate pathway promotes, and simvastatin inhibits, the expres-\nsion of RHAMM, which is necessary for ERK phosphorylation and\nBCCMI, via a transcriptional mechanismmediated directly by YAP.\nWith two previously unrecognized TEAD binding sites in its pro-\nmoter, RHAMM is demonstrated as a unique transcriptional\ntarget of YAP-TEAD. Mevalonate or simvastatin modulates\nRHAMM transcription through regulating the phosphoryla-\ntion and nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of YAP, the\ndownstream effector of the Hippo pathway. In vivo experi-\nments and analysis show that RHAMM and YAP are overex-\npressed in human breast invasive ductal carcinoma, and that\nsimvastatin inhibits expression of RHAMMand activation of YAP\nand ERK in human breast tumor xenografts in mice. Our findings\ntherefore identify RHAMM as a direct transcriptional target of\nYAP and a downstream action target of simvastatin, and reveal\ninteresting interplay between the mevalonate metabolic pathway\nand the Hippo signaling pathway, in breast cancer metastasis.\n\nFig. 1. RHAMM is essential for BCCMI, and the mevalonate pathway reg-\nulates RHAMM expression, ERK activation, and BCCMI.

BCCMI has been shown to be inhibited by sim-\nvastatin (25), and our experiments of transwell migration assays\nusing MDA-MB-231 human mammary tumor cells and 4T1 mouse\nmammary tumor cells confirmed this observation (Fig. S1). As\nsimvastatin is a specific inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme\nHMGCR in the mevalonate pathway, we tested whether the in-\nhibition of migration is caused by disturbance of the mevalonate\npathway. Indeed, this inhibition was reversed by addition of meval-\nonate (Fig. S1A andC). In vitro invasion assay usingMatrigel-coated\nTranswell inserts further confirmed the effects of simvastatin and\nmevalonate (Fig. S1 B andD), showing that the mevalonate pathway\nplays an essential role in regulating BCCMI, which is blocked\nby simvastatin.\nAs the oncogenic protein RHAMM is reported to overexpress\n\nand act as a cell surface receptor to promote BCCMI through\nforming complexes with CD44 and ERK1/2 (20), we investigated\nthe direct relationship between RHAMM protein and the migra-\ntion and invasion in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Two independent\nlentivirus-mediated shRNAs directed toward RHAMM down-\nregulated the expression of RHAMM protein (Fig. 1A), and sig-\nnificantly inhibited the migration (Fig. 1B) and invasion (Fig. 1C)\nof MDA-MB-231 cells in transwell assays. In the same time frame,\nknockdown of RHAMM did not significantly affect cell growth of\nMDA-MB-231. These results demonstrate that RHAMM is es-\nsential in promoting the motility and aggression of the breast\ncancer cells, and, taken together with the preceding results, raised\nthe possibility that the mevalonate pathway and RHAMM are\nconnected, as they are both involved in the regulation of BCCMI.\nTo test this hypothesis, we measured the mRNA and pro-\n\ntein levels of RHAMM by using real-time RT-PCR and\nWestern blot, respectively, with and without the interference\nof the mevalonate pathway. Both mRNA and protein levels of\nRHAMM were markedly reduced after the cells were treated\nby simvastatin, whereas adding mevalonate abolished the in-\nhibitory effect of simvastatin on RHAMM expression in\nMDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1 D and E) and 4T1 (Fig. 1 F and G) cells.\nMoreover, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by simvastatin\nmarkedly down-regulated the activity of RHAMM promoter as\nindicated by reporter gene expression (Fig. 1H), whereas adding\nmevalonate restored the promoter activity of RHAMM. These\nresults indicate that RHAMM expression is positively regulated\n\nby the mevalonate pathway and targeted by simvastatin inhibition\nthrough a transcriptional mechanism.\nThat RHAMM expression is regulated by mevalonate path-\n\nway suggests that RHAMM is involved in mevalonate pathway-\nmediated regulation of BCCMI. RHAMM has been shown to\nform a complex with ERK1/2 to maintain the activity of ERK1/\n2 in breast cancer cells, which promoted the motility of invasive\nbreast cancer cells (20). Consistently, we found that down-regu-\nlation of RHAMM expression by lentivirus-mediated shRNA\ninhibited ERK activity by reducing the phosphorylation level of\nERK (Fig. 1I). In addition, simvastatin reduced the phosphory-\nlation level of ERK, whereas mevalonate rescued the inhibition by\nsimvastatin (Fig. 1J and Fig. S2). These results suggest that\nRHAMM-mediated ERK activation is required for the mevalonate\npathway-promoted, simvastatin-inhibited BCCMI. That down-\nregulation of RHAMM expression by shRNA and by simvastatin\nhad equivalent effect on ERK activation and BCCMI indicates that\nthe effect of mevalonate pathway or simvastatin on BCCMI is in-\ndeed mediated through RHAMM expression and ERK activation.\n\nRHAMM Is a Direct Transcriptional Target Gene of YAP-TEAD of the\nHippo Pathway. As the mevalonate pathway and simvastatin\nappeared to modulate RHAMM expression at the transcrip-\ntional level, we next tried to identify the transcription factor(s)\nthat mediated this effect. We analyzed the RHAMM promoter\nregion by using MatInspector (Genomatix) and found it harbors\ntwo putative binding sites (\u201cGGAATG\u201d) for the transcription\nfactor TEAD at the nucleotide positions of \u2212291 to \u2212285 (TEAD\nbinding site 1, TB1) and \u2212103 to \u221297 (TEAD binding site 2, TB2)\nof the transcription start site (Fig. 2A). TEAD-mediated tran-\nscription is activated upon binding to the transcription coactivator\nYAP when the latter is not phosphorylated at Ser127 (28, 29). To\nverify physical association of endogenous YAP and TEAD with\nthe RHAMM promoter sequence in MDA-MB-231 cells, ChIP\nassay was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 B and C, RHAMM\npromoter is occupied by YAP and TEAD4 in MDA-MB-231\ncells. To further test for the binding and direct control of\nRHAMM transcription by YAP/TEAD, we separately cloned the\nWT RHAMM promoter (\u22121830 to 1) and the RHAMM pro-\nmoter mutants with single (\u0394TB1 and \u0394TB2) or double (\u0394TB1/2)\nTEAD-binding site deletion into the luciferase reporter plasmid.\nThen, we cotransfected WT or one of the \u0394TB1, \u0394TB2, or \u0394TB1/\n2 RHAMM reporters with V5-YAP (human YAP expression\nplasmid; provided by Makiko Fujii, Aichi Cancer Center Research\n\nFig. 2.

(B and C)\nYAP (B) and TEAD4 (C) bound to the RHAMM pro-\nmoter by ChIP assay.

(D) The putative\nTEAD-binding sites were important for YAP-medi-\nated RHAMM promoter activity. (Upper) The two\nTEAD-binding sites were deleted individually or in\ncombination.

Thus, this cell line allows\nus to observe the effect of increased active YAP on RHAMM\ntranscription more directly. As shown in Fig. 2D, deletion of single\nor both TEAD-binding sites at nucleotide positions \u2212291 to \u2212285\nand \u2212103 to \u221297 relative to the transcriptional start site dramati-\ncally decreased the transcriptional activity of the RHAMM pro-\nmoter, and the WT RHAMM luciferase promoter was significantly\nactivated by the exogenous V5-YAP, whereas the mutant reporters\nwere essentially unaffected (Fig. 2D), indicating that the TEAD-\nbinding sites are required for YAP-TEAD binding and RHAMM\npromoter activity, and RHAMM reporter transcription is activated\ndirectly by YAP-TEAD. To further elucidate the contribution of\nendogenous YAP and TEAD in controlling the RHAMM pro-\nmoter activity, YAP or TEAD1/3/4 were individually knocked down\nin MDA-MB-231 cells by shRNA (Fig. 2E). As shown in Fig. 2E,\ndown-regulation of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 repressed RHAMM pro-\nmoter activity markedly, showing that endogenous YAP and TEAD\nare required for RHAMM promoter activity, i.e., transcriptional\nactivation of RHAMM reporter gene.\nWe next tested whether YAP/TEAD directly regulates the en-\n\ndogenous RHAMM gene expression at the mRNA and protein\nlevels in MDA-MB-231 cells. Lentivirus-mediated shRNA was used\nto knockdown YAP or TEAD1/3/4, and RNAi specificity and effi-\nciency were confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 3 B, 2 and 3).\nKnockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4 expression resulted in a dra-\nmatic reduction in RHAMM mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein levels\n(Fig. 3 B, 1) in MDA-MB-231 cells. As a positive control, the\ntranscriptional activation activity of YAP and TEAD was confirmed\nby the measurement of the mRNA of CTGF, whose expression is\nknown to depend on YAP-TEAD. Knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/\n3/4 caused a significant decrease in CTGFmRNA inMDA-MB-231\ncells (Fig. 3C). In addition, we overexpressed V5-YAP in HEK\n293T cells and found that it markedly up-regulated both RHAMM\nmRNA (Fig. 3D) and protein (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these\nresults demonstrate that the transcription coactivator YAP, in\npartner with the transcription factor TEAD, directly regulate and\nare required for transcription of RHAMM.\n\nYAP and TEAD Regulate BCCMI Through Control of RHAMM Transcription.\nAs YAP and TEAD depletion repressed transcription of RHAMM,\nand knockdown of RHAMM expression inhibited ERK phos-\nphorylation and migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 breast\ncancer cells, we next investigated the involvement of endogenous\nYAP and TEAD in ERK activity and the cell migration and in-\nvasion by using lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting YAP or\nTEAD1/3/4. As shown in Fig. 3, knockdown of YAP or TEAD1/3/4,\nby short hairpin RNA of YAP (shYAP) or short hairpin RNA of\nTEAD1/3/4 (shTEAD1/3/4), resulted in down-regulated ERK ac-\ntivity (Fig. 3F). Transwell assay showed dramatic inhibition of mi-\ngration (Fig. 3G) and invasion (Fig. 3H) in shYAP- or shTEAD1/\n3/4-infected MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Reexpression of\nRHAMM, as confirmed in Fig. S3, largely rescued the inhibited\nmigration (Fig. 3G) and invasion (Fig. 3H) caused by YAP or\nTEAD1/3/4 knockdown. These results show that YAP and TEAD\nare essential for ERK activity and BCCMI, in accordance with\ntheir role of directly regulating transcription of RHAMM nec-\nessary for ERK activation and BCCMI. In other words, YAP/\nTEAD-controlled transcription of RHAMM is responsible for\nthe regulation of BCCMI, i.e., the regulation of BCCMI by YAP/\nTEAD goes through RHAMM expression.\n\nMevalonate Pathway and Simvastatin Regulates YAP Phosphorylation\nand Cellular Localization to Control RHAMM Transcription. Having\nshown that simvastatin attenuates RHAMM transcription via the\nmevalonate pathway and that RHAMM transcription is con-\ntrolled by YAP, we next tried to delineate the mechanism\nwhereby YAP-mediated RHAMM transcription is regulated by\nthe mevalonate pathway and simvastatin. YAP activity is known\nto depend on its cellular localization which, in turn, is de-\ntermined by its phosphorylation status. Phosphorylation of YAP\nat Ser127 induces translocation of YAP from the nucleus to\ncytoplasm, thus reducing the transcriptional activity of TEAD.\nBased on these, the phosphorylation status of YAP at Ser127 was\ndetected by using a specific antibody with and without the in-\nhibition of the mevalonate pathway by simvastatin. As shown in\nFig. 4, simvastatin induced an increase in phosphorylation level\nof YAP at Ser127 in MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells, and this effect\nwas abolished by adding mevalonate (Fig. 4 A and B), which\n\nFig. 3. YAP and TEAD are required for RHAMM\nexpression, ERK activity, and BCCMI, whereas ectopic\nexpression of RHAMM bypasses the requirement.

In fact, simvastatin robustly repressed the\ntranscription of a YAP target gene CTGF, which contained three\nputative YAP-TEAD binding sites, whereas the repression was\nreversed by mevalonate (Fig. 4C), indicating specificity of the\neffect of simvastatin or mevalonate on YAP. We then examined\nthe localization of YAP in the cells treated with simvastatin.\nConsistent with the increased phosphorylation level of YAP at\nSer127, simvastatin treatment induced translocation of YAP from\nthe nucleus to cytoplasm as visualized by immunofluorescent\nstaining, whereas adding mevalonate prevented the YAP trans-\nlocation (Fig. 4 D and E). Nucleocytoplasmic separation assay\nfurther confirmed that simvastatin induced the nucleocytoplasmic\ntranslocation of YAP through blockage of the mevalonate pathway\n(Fig. 4F). Surprisingly, although immunofluorescent images (and\ntheir quantification) (Fig. 4 D and E) and Western blot of nucleo-\ncytoplasmic fractionations (Fig. 4F) show that simvastatin caused\nthe nuclear YAP protein to decrease dramatically, that was ac-\ncompanied by a marginal increase in cytoplasmic YAP protein,\nwhich suggests that YAP may be degraded upon translocation to\nthe cytoplasm. Indeed, YAP was significantly polyubiquitinated af-\nter the cells were treated by simvastatin, indicating that YAP is\ndegraded upon translocation to the cytoplasm through the ubiq-\nuitin\u2013proteasome pathway, whereas adding mevalonate abolished\n\nthe effect of simvastatin (Fig. S4). These results indicate that sim-\nvastatin promotes YAP phosphorylation and cytoplasmic seques-\ntration and degradation to suppress RHAMM transcription. In\naddition, simvastatin significantly reduced the binding of YAP to\nRHAMM promoter (Fig. 4G), consistent with YAP being seques-\ntered by simvastatin treatment. Taken together, our results reveal\npossibly a key mechanism for simvastatin to inhibit the metastasis of\nhuman breast cancer, in which simvastatin acts on the mevalonate\npathway, which converges with Hippo pathway onto YAP and its\ntarget gene RHAMM transcription.\n\nRHAMM and YAP Are Overexpressed in Human Invasive Breast Tumors,\nand Simvastatin Attenuates RHAMM Expression and YAP and ERK\nActivation in Human Breast Tumor Xenografts in Mice. Given the\nrole of YAP and RHAMM in BCCMI, we investigated the ex-\npression profile of YAP and RHAMM in human invasive ductal\nbreast carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry were performed on tis-\nsue sections from patients with breast cancer. Compared with\ncancer-adjacent normal breast tissue, YAP and RHAMM are\nexpressed at much higher levels in the invasive breast tumors, with\nYAP nuclear staining also observed (Fig. 5A), which is in agree-\nment with the in vitro data and the role of and relation between\nYAP and RHAMM. Having shown in cells that simvastatin reg-\nulates YAP activity to inhibit RHAMM expression and ERK ac-\ntivity, we further investigated the in vivo relevance of the in vitro\n\nFig. 4. YAP phosphorylation, cytoplasmic localization, and transactivating activity are modulated by mevalonate pathway and simvastatin (Sim). (A and B)\nSimvastatin significantly inhibited YAP activity (enhanced YAP phosphorylation), whereas adding mevalonate (Meva) abolished the effect in MDA-MB-231 (A)\nand 4T1 (B) cells. Cells were treated with or without 250 \u03bcM Meva for 6 h before incubation with DMSO or 5 \u03bcM simvastatin for 24 h and preparation of\nlysates, which were immunoblotted with p-YAP (Ser-127) and YAP antibodies, respectively (Left), and the protein bands quantified (Right).

Compared with\ntumors from control mice, mRNA (Fig. 5B) and protein (Fig. 5C)\nlevels of RHAMM were markedly reduced in tumors from sim-\nvastatin-treated mice whereas the phosphorylation of YAP in-\ncreased and the phosphorylation of ERK decreased (Fig. 5C).\nThese in vivo results are in agreement with and extend our results\nfrom cellular and molecular investigations, and establish the phys-\niological and pathological significance for the role of YAP-con-\ntrolled RHAMM expression, the interplay between the mevalonate\nand Hippo pathways, and the inhibition by simvastatin in in-\ntervention of BCCMI.\n\nGeranylgeranylation Downstream of Mevalonate Is Essential for\nthe Regulation of YAP Activity, RHAMM Transcription, and ERK\nActivation. As simvastatin blocks at an upstream step in the\nmevalonate pathway, which encompasses multiple additional\ndownstream components as well as branches, we next in-\nvestigated which of those participate in regulating YAP-mediated\nRHAMM transcription leading to BCCMI. Geranylgeranyl py-\nrophosphate (GGPP) lies downstream of mevalonate in the\npathway and is a key precursor molecule for protein prenylation\nincluding geranylgeranylation. Preventing geranylgeranylation of\nRhoA has been suggested as a mechanism for statin-induced\nblockade of tumor cell migration and invasion (42). We used a se-\nlective geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-2133 to test\nwhether GGPP-dependent geranylgeranylation is involved. In-\nhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase by GGTI-2133 had a pro-\nfound negative impact on RHAMM mRNA (Fig. 6 A and C) and\nprotein expression levels (Fig. 6 B and D, Upper), YAP and ERK\nphosphorylation (Fig. 6 B and D), and cytoplasmic location of YAP\n(Fig. 6 E and F). These results suggest that geranylgeranylation is\nrequired to regulate YAP activity, RHAMM transcription, and\nERK activation. Moreover, to the cells treated with simvastatin,\naddition of GGPP, which is downstream of mevalonate in the\npathway, was sufficient to reverse the effects of simvastatin on YAP\nactivity (Fig. 6 H and J) and nuclear localization (Fig. 6 K and L),\nRHAMM expression (Fig. 6 G\u2013J), and ERK activity (Fig. 6 H and\nJ). These results suggest that geranylgeranylation is indeed an es-\nsential step downstream of mevalonate in the pathway leading to\nYAP-dependent RHAMM transcription and BCCMI.\n\nMevalonate Pathway Modulates YAP Phosphorylation via Rho GTPase\nActivation and Actin Cytoskeleton Rearrangement Independent of\nMST and LATS Kinase Activity. Rho GTPase and actin cytoskele-\nton rearrangement have recently been reported to play a role in\nregulating YAP of the Hippo pathway (33, 34), which bypasses\nthe core kinase cascade, and the mevalonate pathway has been\nshown to control Rho GTPase activity and actin cytoskeleton\norganization (24). We next tested whether Rho GTPase and\ncytoskeleton are involved in the mevalonate pathway-mediated\nregulation of YAP activity and RHAMM expression. Similar to\nprevious work (24), we also observed that simvastatin inhibited\nRho activity and disrupted actin cytoskeleton, and these effects\ncould be rescued by adding mevalonate or GGPP (Fig. S5 A and\nC). Furthermore, GGTI-2133 inhibited Rho activity and dis-\nrupted actin cytoskeleton (Fig. S5 B and C). To investigate\nwhether mevalonate pathway regulated YAP activity through\nRho GTPase, lentivirus-mediated constitutively active RhoA\n(Q63L) was used to infect the cells. Indeed, RhoA (Q63L)-\nEGFP largely restored the levels of YAP activity, RHAMM\nexpression, and ERK activity, which had been markedly brought\ndown by simvastatin (Fig. 7 A and B). Furthermore, a specific\nRho inhibitor, C3 transferase, could also mimic simvastatin ef-\nfect on YAP activity, RHAMM expression, and ERK activity\n(Fig. 7 C\u2013E). To test whether the actin cytoskeleton is involved\nin the regulation of YAP by the mevalonate pathway, we used\nchemical (cytoskeleton disrupting reagent cytochalasin D) and\nphysical (hydrogel) methods to induce actin cytoskeleton change.\nSimilar to simvastatin treatment, disruption of actin cytoskeleton\nby cytochalasin D and hydrogel increased YAP phosphorylation\n(Fig. 7E), induced YAP cytoplasmic translocation (Fig. 7C),\ninhibited RHAMM expression (Fig. 7 D and E), and ERK ac-\ntivity (Fig. 7E). These data support that Rho GTPase and cy-\ntoskeleton organization downstream of geranylgeranylation are\nrequired to regulate YAP activity, RHAMM transcription, and\nERK activation.\nThe core kinases of the Hippo pathway, MST1/2 and LATS1/2,\n\nare known to control the phosphorylation level and activity of\nYAP. We next investigated whether MST and LATS kinases were\ninvolved in mevalonate pathway-mediated regulation of YAP.\nMDA-MB-231 cells express minimal level of phosphorylated\nMST as detected by Western blot (Fig. 7F). The cells were\ntransfected with Flag-MST2 to boost its MST in the phosphory-\nlated form. However, the phosphorylation level of MST in the\nMDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Flag-MST2 was not affected\nby the treatment of mevalonate, simvastatin, and simvastatin plus\nmevalonate (Fig. 7F, lanes 4\u20136 vs. lane 2). The specificity of the\nphospho (p)-MST antibody was confirmed by \u03bb-phosphatase\ntreatment (Fig. 7F, lane 3 vs. lane 2). We also examined the\nphosphorylation of endogenous LATS in these treatment set-\ntings, similar to MST, the phosphorylation level of LATS was\nbasically unchanged (Fig. 7G, lanes 3\u20135 vs. lane 1). Also, the\nspecificity of the p-LATS antibody was confirmed by \u03bb-phospha-\ntase treatment (Fig. 7G, lane 2 vs. lane 1). In addition, Rho in-\nhibitor C3, cytochalasin D, or hydrogel showed no effect on MST\nphosphorylation in the MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Flag-\nMST2 (Fig. 7F) or the phosphorylation of endogenous LATS\n(Fig. 7G), which suggests that the mevalonate pathway modulates\nYAP phosphorylation and activity via actin cytoskeleton rear-\nrangement independent of MST and LATS kinase activity.\nTo further confirm the results, lentivirus-mediated shRNAs\n\nagainst LATS were used. As shown in Fig. 7 H and I, depletion of\nLATS1 or/and LATS2 had marginal effect on YAP phosphory-\nlation (Fig. 7I), RHAMM mRNA (Fig. 7H) and protein expres-\nsion (Fig. 7I), and ERK activity (Fig. 7I) induced by simvastatin.\nTaken together, these data suggest that the core kinase cascade of\nthe Hippo pathway is not affected by the mevalonate pathway,\nand vice versa, and the mevalonate pathway modulates YAP\n\nFig. 5. YAP and RHAMM are co-overexpressed in human breast invasive\ntumors, and simvastatin (Sim) modulates YAP phosphorylation, RHAMM\nexpression, and ERK activity in the MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor xen-\nografts in mice. (A) YAP and RHAMM are both overexpressed in human\nbreast invasive ductal carcinoma. Tissue sections from breast invasive ductal\ncarcinoma and cancer-adjacent normal breast tissue were immunostained\nwith anti-YAP and anti-RHAMM antibody, and analyzed by light microscopy.\n(B and C) Simvastatin modulated YAP phosphorylation, RHAMM expression,\nand ERK activity in the MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor xenografts. (B)\nSimvastatin inhibited RHAMM mRNA expression in vivo. Total RNA was\nextracted from tumors from control (saline) or simvastatin-treated mice and\nthen RHAMM mRNA levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR. (C) Sim-\nvastatin inhibited YAP activity, RHAMM protein expression, and ERK activity\nin vivo.

YAP acts directly\non the promoter and regulates the transcription of RHAMM,\nwhich modulates the ERK activity and cell motility in the breast\ncancer cells. In addition, the molecular and cellular findings are\ncorroborated by results of in vivo investigations.\nThe mevalonate pathway produces isoprenoids that are vital\n\nfor many cellular functions, including cholesterol synthesis and\ngrowth control (22). Tumor cell metabolism is regulated by the\n\nmevalonate pathway as a number of components or metabolic\nproducts in this pathway, including HMGCR, mevalonate, cho-\nlesterol, and isoprenoids, have been linked to tumor progression\n(23). HMGCR, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate\npathway, is a candidate metabolic oncogene reportedly to de-\nregulate in several types of cancers (43). In patients with breast\ncancer, high messenger RNA levels of HMGCR, among other\nfour mevalonate pathway genes, are found to correlate with poor\nprognosis (23). Mutant p53 can significantly up-regulate meval-\nonate metabolism and protein prenylation through promoting\ntranscription of genes encoding mevalonate pathway enzymes,\nincluding HMGCR in carcinoma cells, which contribute to the\nmaintenance of the malignant phenotype (27). In addition,\nHMGCR apparently cooperates with RAS in promoting the\ntransformation of WT primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts\n\nFig. 6. Geranylgeranylation downstream of mevalonate pathway mediates regulation of YAP activity, RHAMM expression, and ERK activity.

We found that the mevalonate pathway affects the migration\nand invasionofMDA-MB-231 and4T1breast cancer cells (Fig. 1 and\nFig. S1). Inhibiting the mevalonate pathway by simvastatin down-\nregulates RHAMM expression and suppress BCCMI, whereas\nadding mevalonate reverses the suppression of RHAMM as well as\nthe migration and invasion caused by the simvastatin, demonstrating\na role of the mevalonate pathway in controlling breast cancer me-\ntastasis via RHAMM.\nIt has long been recognized that intervening with the meval-\n\nonate pathway may be useful for certain cancer treatments (44).\nStatins, a class of HMGCR inhibitors that block the mevalonate\npathway at its rate-limiting step, are clinically used to treat cardio-\nvascular and cerebrovascular diseases. They have gained increasing\n\nrecognition as anticancer agents and exhibited anticancer activity in\na variety of in vitro and in vivo preclinical models (22, 23). Beside\npreclinical and some clinical observations, epidemiologic data sug-\ngest that statins can lower the risk of certain cancers by as much as\n50%. Those promising preclinical results have led to at least 18\nreported phase I and I/II clinical trials (23). In breast cancer, statins\nprevented metastasis by inhibiting CD44 expression through pro-\nmoting p53 expression (25). Statins enhance the effects of a number\nof chemotherapeutic drugs with only a few exceptions, and also\nincrease the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of multidrug resistance\ncells. In tumor-bearing mice, statins used in combination treatments\nshow the additional advantageous effects of attenuated cardiotox-\nicity and reduced kidney or liver damage, although these effects are\nstill waiting to be verified in clinical trials (43). Our present results\nfurther show that simvastatin is able to down-regulate key factors in\ntumor formation and progression, particularly metastasis, and thus\nhas valuable therapeutic benefits for cancer treatment.\nAs our results showed that RHAMM is a downstream target\n\nregulated by the mevalonate pathway, we then set out to search for\nthe factors that may regulate the promoter activity of RHAMM.\nSurprisingly, we found that key components of the Hippo signaling\npathway, namely YAP and TEAD, directly control the transcription\nof RHAMM. Moreover, we found that the mevalonate pathway\nregulates the expression of RHAMM through impacting on the\nHippo pathway and its downstream effectors YAP and TEAD.\nHighly conserved in mammals, the Hippo pathway is known to\n\nplay a key role in organ size control and tissue regeneration, and\nto be involved in embryonic development, stem cell differentia-\ntion, and control of proliferation, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal tran-\nsition, and tumorigenesis. Deregulation of the Hippo pathway\ninduces tumors in model organisms and occurs in many human\ncarcinomas, including lung, colorectal, ovarian, and liver cancer\n(39). The core mammalian Hippo pathway is a kinase cascade\nconsisting of MST1/2, Sav1, Lats1/2, and Mob1, which phos-\nphorylates and inhibits YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ in conjunction with\nTEAD1\u20134 mediates major physiological functions of the Hippo\npathway. TEADs contain in the N-terminal region a conserved\nTEA domain for recognizing and binding DNA elements such as\nGGAATG in the promoter region of target genes (45).\nWe examined the promoter sequence of RHAMM and found\n\ntwo putative TEAD binding sites (TB1 and TB2; Fig. 2A). YAP\nand its target transcription factor TEAD bind to the TEAD\nbinding sites in RHAMM promoter (Fig. 2 B and C), and YAP/\nTEAD binding to TEAD-binding sites in RHAMM promoter is\nrequired for YAP-mediated RHAMM transcriptional activation\n(Fig. 2 D and E), consistent with the previous report that YAP/\nTEAD interaction and activity plays causal roles in cancer pro-\ngression and metastasis (36). Moreover, knockdown of YAP or\nTEAD in MDA-MB-231 cells induced a dramatic reduction of\nRHAMM expression in mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3 A and\nB). Taken together, these data demonstrated RHAMM as a di-\nrect transcriptional target of YAP.\nWe have further demonstrated that the mevalonate pathway\n\ncontrols YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 and cytoplasmic seques-\ntration (Fig. 4). Meanwhile, YAP/TEAD is essential to sustain the\nmotility of breast cancer cells, as knockdown of YAP or TEAD\nsignificantly suppressed migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231\ncells which could be largely rescued by reexpression of RHAMM\n(Fig. 3 G and H). These and our other results establish an\nimportant and specific role of YAP (Hippo pathway)-regulated\nRHAMM in BCCMI, of YAP in RHAMM expression, and of\nRHAMM in YAP biology.\nFurthermore, immunohistochemistry indicated that YAP and\n\nRHAMM are overexpressed in human invasive ductal breast\ncarcinoma (Fig. 5A), and in vivo data also revealed that simvas-\ntatin modulates YAP phosphorylation, RHAMM expression, and\nERK activity in the MDA-MB-231\u2013generated tumors in mice (Fig.\n5 B and C). These findings corroborate our results from in vitro\n\nFig. 7. Mevalonate pathway regulates YAP activity, RHAMM expression, and\nERK activity through Rho GTPase activity and actin cytoskeleton rearrange-\nment largely independent of MST and LATS. (A and B) Constitutively active\nRhoA (Q63L) rescued RHAMM mRNA expression (A) and RHAMM protein ex-\npression, and YAP and ERK activity (B) decreased by simvastatin (Sim). MDA-\nMB-231 cells were infected with lentivirus-mediated constitutively active RhoA\n(Q63L)-EGFP, and, 24 h later, treated with simvastatin for another 24 h and\nanalyzed by real-time RT-PCR (A) and Western blot with the indicated anti-\nbodies (B). (C\u2013E) Disruption of actin cytoskeleton by various methods induced\ntranslocation of YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (C), decrease in\nRHAMM mRNA level (D), and inhibition of RHAMM protein expression and\nYAP and ERK activation (E). MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with cytochalasin\nD or C3 transferase for 6 h or cultured on 1 kPa hydrogel for 24 h to disrupt\nactin cytoskeleton assembly, and then fixed and stained with phalloidin\n(green), YAP antibody (red) and DAPI (blue) for immunofluorescent imaging\n(C), or analyzed by real-time RT-PCR (D) or Western blot with the indicated\nantibodies (E). (F and G) MST phosphorylation (F) or LATS phosphorylation (G)\nwas not modulated by mevalonate pathway/simvastatin, or actin cytoskeleton-\ndisrupting cytochalasin D, C3 transferase, or culturing on 1 kPa hydrogel in\nMDA-MB-231 cells. (F) Cells were transfected with Flag-MST2 for 24 h and then\ntreated with the indicated reagents, and cell lysates were immunoblotted with\np-MST and Flag antibodies. The specificity of the p-MST antibody was\nconfirmed by \u03bb-phosphatase (PPase) treatment (lane 3). (G) Cell lysates\nwere immunoblotted with p-LATS1 and LATS1 antibodies. The specificity\nof the p-LATS antibody was confirmed by \u03bb-phosphatase treatment (lane\n2). (H and I) Knockdown of LATS did not affect simvastatin-induced in-\nhibition of RHAMM mRNA expression (H) or RHAMM protein expression\nand YAP and ERK activation (I). MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with\nthe indicated shRNA lentiviruses, treated with or without simvastatin for\n24 h, and then analyzed by real-time RT-PCR to determine RHAMM mRNA\nlevels (H) or Western blot to detect the proteins (I).

More im-\nportantly, our findings reveal a direct link between the mevalonate\nand the Hippo pathway in controlling tumor progression.\nIn cancers, Hippo pathway is often perturbed through cross-\n\ntalk with a number of key signaling pathways that frequently\nharbor oncogenic mutations. These major pathways include Wnt,\nTGF-\u03b2, bone morphogenetic protein, G protein-coupled re-\nceptor (GPCR), Hedgehog, insulin\u2013mammalian target of rapamy-\ncin, and Notch pathways (39). Our present results suggest that, in\naddition to these major pathways, the mevalonate pathway interacts\nwith and regulates the Hippo pathway by directly controlling the\nYAP phosphorylation, cellular localization, and thus its activity.\nThese findings added another layer of complexity to the networks\nthat can act upon the Hippo pathway, and underscore the vital role\nof Hippo pathway as a tumor suppressor that needs to succumb for\ntumor advancement.\nWe further investigated how the mevalonate pathway inter-\n\nplays with the Hippo pathway in regulating YAP activity and the\ndownstream RHAMM transcription activity. The isoprenoids\nfarnesyl pyrophosphate and GGPP are key end products of the\nmevalonate pathway. The isoprenylation process by the afore-\nmentioned products can posttranslationally modify proteins with\nC-terminal CAAX, CXC, or CC motifs (23). Isoprenylation is\nessential for proper localization and activity of the RAS super-\nfamily of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Among\nthese, the Rho family has been closely linked to cancer, as their\nderegulated activation drives transformation and their elevated\nexpression is associated with several human tumors. RhoA and\nRhoC are thought to have a role in metastasis. Recent evidence\nhas linked Rho GTPases to tumor metabolism through activa-\ntion of glutaminase, which catalyzes the conversion of glutamine\nto glutamate and ammonia, a key step in glutamine metabolism\nthat contributes to the Warburg phenomenon (23). The activity\nof these small GTPases depends on the mevalonate pathway, as\nthey require isoprenylation to function properly. The mevalonate\npathway has been reported to lead to geranylgeranylation of\nRhoA and its subsequent membrane tethering and activation\n(22). The Hippo pathway is regulated by GPCR signaling, as cell-\nsurface GPCRs also couple to RhoA GTPase activation, leading\nto Lats1/2 inhibition and induction of YAP/TAZ; and RhoA\nactivation induces actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which plays\nimportant roles in the Hippo\u2013YAP cascade (34). Indeed, we\nfound that geranylgeranylation downstream of the mevalonate\npathway is required and sufficient to activate YAP and RHAMM\nexpression and ERK activation, as selective geranylgeranyl trans-\nferase inhibitor significantly inhibited YAP activity, RHAMM\nexpression, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6 A\u2013F), and sim-\nvastatin-induced inhibition was reversed by supplementing with\nGGPP (Fig. 6 G\u2013L). We have further demonstrated that sim-\nvastatin disrupted actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, which is\nrequired for YAP activation and RHAMM transcription (Fig. 7).\nRhoA has been reported to activate YAP via inhibition of\nLATS1/2 but independent of MST1/2 (31) or independent of\nboth MST1/2 and LATS1/2 activities (33). We found that the\nmevalonate pathway modulates YAP phosphorylation via actin\ncytoskeleton rearrangement independent of MST and LATS ki-\nnase activity (Fig. 7 and Fig. S5).\nRHAMM is poorly expressed in most normal human tissues.\n\nRHAMM promotes wound repair, and its expression is increased\nduring wound repair in response to hypoxia and fibrogenic factors\n(5). Its expression is also elevated during the neoplastic progression\nof a variety of human tumors. Overexpression of RHAMM is\ntransforming and required for maintaining RAS transformation (6).\nConsistently, RHAMM is considered a novel breast cancer suscep-\ntibility gene, and a significant association between homozygous\n\nvariation in this gene and early-onset breast cancer has been found\n(2). Overexpression of RHAMM in patients with primary breast\ncancer was prognostic of poor outcome in cancer progression. In\nparticular, RHAMM expression contributes to the motility and\ninvasiveness of a tumor cell subpopulation in breast cancers (7).\nRHAMMoverexpression occurred within subsets of tumor cells in\nthe primary tumor that was associatedwith lymphnodemetastases.\nThe metastatic tumors showed a significantly higher level of\nRHAMM than did the primary tumor. RHAMM is also a tumor-\nassociated antigen found in solid and blood tumors. RHAMM\nfunctions as cell-surface HA receptor and cytoplasmic mitotic\nspindle binding protein (4, 5). Itmediates tumorprogression through\nCD44 partnership and promotes genomic instability via regulating\nthe mitotic spindle/centrosome integrity (18, 19). This RHAMM-\nregulated activation process results in increased cell-surface expres-\nsion of CD44 and enhanced activation of ERK1/2. In breast cancer,\nactivation of extracellular HA binding by CD44\u2013RHAMM com-\nplexes confers malignant potential (20). Importantly, RHAMM ex-\npression is down-regulated by the tumor suppressor p53, and the\nRHAMMpromoter, including thefirst exon and intron,mediates the\nrepression by p53 (46). Our present results show that YAP, a key\ncomponent of the Hippo signaling pathway, exerts direct regulation\non the RHAMM promoter activity. In addition, the mevalonate\npathway exerts regulation on the transcription activity of RHAMM\nby modulating the phosphorylation level and the cytoplasmic locali-\nzation and degradation of YAP (Fig. 8). Further, we show that\nRHAMM and YAP expression correlate with each other\u2014both are\nelevated in human breast tumors, and our findings at molecular and\ncellular levels are confirmed in the human tumor mouse model (Fig.\n5) and are thus physiologically and pathologically significant.\nIn summary, we have found that the mevalonate pathway\n\nand the Hippo pathway interact and converge onto YAP and\nTEAD to regulate RHAMM transcription and subsequent\n\nFig. 8. Model of mevalonate and Hippo pathways regulating YAP-controlled\nRHAMM transcription and cancer cell motility. Mevalonate pathway regulates\nactivity of YAP, the downstream effector of Hippo pathway, which activates\ntranscription of RHAMM that is required for ERK activation and cancer cell mi-\ngration and invasion. YAP/TEAD activates RHAMM transcription by binding to\nRHAMM promoter at two specific TEAD-binding sites. Mevalonate pathway\npromotes and simvastatin inhibits YAP activity, and consequently RHAMM tran-\nscription, ERK activation, and cancer metastasis, via modulating YAP phosphory-\nlation and nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution. The regulation of YAP-mediated\nRHAMM transcription and cancer metastasis depends on geranylgeranylation,\nRho GTPase activity, and actin cytoskeleton assembly, but not the canonical MST/\nLATS cascade.\n\nWang et al.
