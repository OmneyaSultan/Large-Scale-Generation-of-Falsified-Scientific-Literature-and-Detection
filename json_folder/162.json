This study aimed to investigate the chemokine expression in human tubular cells in\nresponse to urine proteins from patients with nephrotic syndrome. Methods: Urine proteins collected from patients with MCD or FSGS\nwere extracted by ultrafiltration and coincubated with HK-2 cells. The expression of the RANTES and MIF genes and the activation of\np38 and extracellular regulated kinase were determined. Results: The urine proteins from both MCD and FSGS patients contained a\nprimary band of proteins with Mr of \ufffd62 kDa. The major cytokines present in urine proteins from MCD and FSGS patients were\nIL-6 and IL-8, while IL-1b, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-a were only detectable. We observed time- and dose-dependent increases in RAN-\nTES and MIF expression with urine protein treatment in HK-2 cells. The urine proteins from FSGS patients induced a higher expression\nof these two chemokines in HK-2 cells compared to the urine proteins from MCD patients. ERK and p38 were activated by urine pro-\nteins from either MCD or FSGS patients. Pretreatment with SB203580 or PD98059 abolished the increase in RANTES and MIF expres-\nsion induced by urine proteins from FSGS patients, while only SB203580 suppressed the high expression induced by urine proteins from\nMCD patients. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the urine proteins from MCD and FSGS patients induce a differential expression\nof RANTES and MIF in tubular cells through distinct activation of MAPK-related signaling pathways.\n\ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nProgressive nephropathies are characterized by a highly\nenhanced glomerular permeability to proteins, in turn lead-\ning to proteinuria and concomitant tubulointerstitial dam-\nage [1\u20133]. How proteinuria results in such precipitating\ninterstitial changes is not fully understood, but it is cer-\ntainly multifactorial and involves numerous pathways of\ncellular damage [2\u20134]. Earlier studies in vitro have already\nconfirmed that certain serum protein components (e.g.\nalbumin and transferrin) can stimulate proximal tubular\n1043-4666/$ - see front matter \ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, it is well estab-\nlished that activation of the extracellular signal regulated\nkinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase\n(MAPK) signal transduction pathway plays an important\nrole in the inflammatory response [8]. p38 and ERK as\nimportant signaling molecular have been proved to medi-\nate release of MIF and RANTES in tubular cells exposed\nto a single component such as albumin or IgG, suggesting\n\nmailto:yuxq@mail.sysu.edu.cn\n\n\nTable 1\nClinical data of patients\n\nPatient characteristic MCD FSGS\n\nNumber 10 12\nSex (male/female) 9/1 9/3\nMean age (years) 21 \u00b1 10 35 \u00b1 17\nProteinuria (g/day) 3.5 \u00b1 1.4 3.7 \u00b1 2.0\nSerum creatinine (lmol/L) 73.0 \u00b1 8.8 92.0 \u00b1 86.7\n\nAbbreviations: FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; MCD, minimal\nchange disease.\n\nZ. Huang et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 222\u2013233 223\na possible link between proteinuria and inflammatory dam-\nage of tubular cells involving MAPK pathway [9,10]. How-\never, these studies have a significant limitation. They have\ngenerally used a single serum component (e.g. albumin) at\nvery high and physiologically irrelevant concentrations to\nstudy the effect of protein overload on proximal tubular\nepithelial cells (PTECs) [11,12]. However, the glomerular\nultrafiltrate often contains a mixture of proteins and a sin-\ngle component might not be responsible for the damage of\ntubular cells in renal disease development [13].\n\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the\nmost prevalent histopathological lesions in idiopathic\nnephrotic syndrome. It is distinguished clinically from min-\nimal change disease (MCD) by non-selective proteinuria,\nsteroid resistance and progressive renal insufficiency. Fur-\nthermore, it has been shown that FSGS patients presented\nmore often with progressive tubular degeneration and\ninterstitial fibrosis compared to MCD patients even though\nboth diseases had a similar degree of proteinuria [14\u201317].\nThus in an effort to find therapeutic targets in proteinuria,\ncomparison of urine proteins in MCD and FSGS patients\nhas been previously conducted [18\u201320], but the relationship\nbetween the severity of tubular injury and the composition\nof urine proteins in various kidney diseases is unknown.\n\nTo seek further evidence, we have hypothesized that the\nuse of a wide range of proteins extracted from proteinuria\nmight closely resemble the glomerular ultrafiltrate in tubu-\nlar lumen and serve as a model for further study in the\nmechanism of tubular damage induced by proteinuria in\nkidney diseases. This study was undertaken to assess and\ncompare the expression of two important chemokines,\nRANTES and MIF, in cultured proximal tubular cells\ntreated with urine proteins extracted from MCD or FSGS\npatients and to explore the possible role of ERK and p38-\nMAPK signaling transduction pathways in differential che-\nmokine production.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Reagents and drugs\n\nHK-2 cells, a primary human proximal tubular cell line,\nwas purchased from American Type Culture Collection\n(Manassas, VA); Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium\n(DMEM)/F-12, fetal bovine serum (FBS) and trypsin/ethy-\nlenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution were pur-\nchased from Gibco (Langley, OK); TRIzol and reverse\ntranscriptase were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA); PCR\nbuffer, Taq polymerase and dNTPs were from Takara Bio\nInc. (Shiga, Japan), and ELISA Quantikine kit for RANTES\nwas from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The specific\ninhibitors, SB203580 and PD98059, were from CalBiochem\n(San Diego, CA). Primary antibodies of p38 and ERK were\nfrom Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Purified\nhuman serum albumin (HSA, A5843), Triton X-100, and\ndimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St.\nLouis, MO). Polymyxin B-immobilized columns (Detoxi-\nGelTM) were from Pierce Chemical (Rockford, IL). The\nultrafilter (Labscale TTF system, PXC 100C 50) was pur-\nchased from Millipore Co. (Billerica, MA). The human\ninflammation Cytometric Bead Array kit for determining\ninterleukins (IL-8, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12p70), and\ntumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and BD LSR II flow\ncytometer were from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA).\n\n2.2. Patients and urine collection\n\nInformed consent was obtained from all patients partici-\npating in this study, after local Ethics Committee approval.\nDiagnosis was established based on the criteria of ICD-11\nfor 10 patients with MCD and 12 patients with FSGS\nthrough biopsy using light and electron microscopy. Only\npatients who have never been treated with steroid or any\nother immunosuppressive agents were enrolled in this study.\nThe spontaneous urine was collected in a clean container on\nice (\ufffd4 \ufffdC) and stored at \ufffd80 \ufffdC until analysis. Some key\nclinical data of the patients studied are summarized in Table 1.\nThe mean urine protein concentration in MCD and FSGS\npatients was 3.5 \u00b1 1.4 mg/ml and 3.7 \u00b1 2.0 mg/ml, respec-\ntively. Thus, a concentration range of 0.1\u201310 mg/ml for\nthe urine proteins was used for our in vitro experiments.\n\n2.3. Urine protein ultrafiltration and preparation\n\nFollowing initial centrifugation (4000g for 15 min at\n4 \ufffdC) the supernatant of urine sample was collected and fil-\ntered by a 0.45-lm filtration membrane to remove non-sol-\nuble deposits and cellular particles. The samples were then\napplied to an ultrafilter with polyethersulfone membrane\n(5 kDa molecule weight cut-off and low protein binding\nmembrane). After lyophilization using a freeze dryer to\nremove extra water, the urine protein extract was stored\nat \ufffd80 \ufffdC. In all in vitro experiment, dried and powdered\nurine proteins were dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS) and then added to cells. Endotoxin in urine\nproteins was removed by polymyxin B-immobilized col-\numns and cleared reagents contained <0.1 EU/ml of endo-\ntoxin as determined by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay.\nUrine proteins were eluted in 0.5 mM NaCl and 50 mM\nTris at pH 7.5. Coomassie-stained sodium dodecyl\nsulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE)\nwas used to verify that there was no gross degradation of\nthe proteins prepared using this protocol.\n\n\n\n224 Z. Huang et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 222\u2013233\n2.4. Quantification of cytokines using cytometric bead array\n\n(CBA)\n\nSix cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70 and\nTNF-a) in patient urine proteins were quantified simulta-\nneously using a human inflammation CBA kit according to\nthe manufacture\u2019s instructions (BD Pharmingen, San Jose,\nCA). The BD LSR II flow cytometer was calibrated with\nsetup beads and 3000 events were acquired for each sample.\nSix standard curves (standard ranging from 0 to 5000 pg/ml)\nwere obtained from one set of calibrators and data on the six\ncytokines were simultaneously obtained for each test sample.\nIndividual cytokine concentration ratios were indicated by\ntheir fluorescent intensities. The urine proteins from each\npatient were dissolved in sterile PBS to a concentration of\n60 mg/ml and assayed. The limits of detection for IL-1b,\nIL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-a were 7.2, 2.5, 3.6,\n3.3, 1.9 and 3.7 pg/ml, respectively.\n\n2.5. Cell culture\n\nHK-2 cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 plus 10%\nFCS. The cells were grown in an atmosphere of 5%\nCO2 and 95% air at 37 \ufffdC and given fresh medium every\n3\u20135 days. Experiments were performed on cells within 10\npassages. Viable cells were counted using the trypan blue\nexclusion method.\n\n2.6. MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage\n\nassay\n\nThe effect of urine proteins on HK-2 cell proliferation\nwas measured using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphe-\nnyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). In brief, cells were grown\nin 96-well culture plates and treated by urine proteins from\nMCD or FSGS patients or HSA for 72 h. The culture vol-\nume was 100 ll. Ninety minutes before the end of the\nappropriate treatment periods, 10 ll of MTT (5 mg/ml in\nPBS) was added to each culture well. After incubation\nfor a further 4 h at 37 \ufffdC, the culture medium was removed\nand the purple crystals formed were dissolved in 150 ll of\n0.1 M HCl in isopropanol. The absorbance was measured\nusing a microplate reader at 570 nm with a background\ncorrection at 690 nm.\n\nThe LDH leakage assay was used to assess cytosolic\nmembrane integrity. HK-2 cells were seeded in 24-well\nplates at a cell density of 3 \ufffd 105 cells in 1000 ll/well and\ntreated by urine proteins for 72 h. Thereafter, 600 ll incu-\nbation medium was collected from the culture wells and\nintracellular LDH was harvested by solubilizing cells with\n600 ll 0.1% Triton X-100. Enzyme leakage was determined\nin the incubation medium and compared with total LDH\nactivity (extracellular plus intracellular LDH) detected with\nan automatic biochemical autoanalyzer (Hitachi 7170A,\nTokyo, Japan). The experiments were performed at least\nthree times, using 4 wells for each test compound at differ-\nent concentrations.\n2.7. Treatment of HK-2 cells with ultrafiltered urine proteins\n\nCells were preincubated with serum-free DMEM/F-12\nfor 24 h. HK-2 cells were exposed to 5 mg/ml HSA, or\nurine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients at concentra-\ntions of 0.1\u201310 mg/ml over 48 h to detect RANTES and\nMIF expression. p38 or ERK protein expression were eval-\nuated by Western blot analysis in cell lysates from HK-2\ncells treated with HSA or urine proteins at 1 mg/ml for\n20 min. To evaluate the effect of ERK and p38 inhibitor\non chemokine expression, cells were pretreated with\n10 mM SB203580 and 50 mM PD98059 for 1 h before\nand during incubation with urine proteins. Both inhibitors\nwere prepared in DMSO with a final concentration of 0.1%\n(v/v) of the solvent in the test sample.\n\n2.8. Total RNA extraction and reverse transcription-\n\npolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent. Extracted\nRNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm using a spec-\ntrometer. Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse tran-\nscribed to cDNA in a 20 ll reaction mixture containing\n50 ng random primer, 0.5 mmol/L dNTPs and 20 U of\nRNase inhibitor. Specific primer sequences were as fol-\nlowed: GAPDH, sense 50-AGT CCA CTG GCG TCT\nTCA C-30, antisense 50-GCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGT\nTGA G-30, 639 bp; RANTES/CCL5, sense 50-GTTTA\nCGGGAAATCT TCGCACC-30, antisense 50-GTCGGA\nGCGGCTGTAGTC-30, 300 bp; and MIF, sense 50-CCT\nGGTCCTTCT GCCATCAT-30, antisense 50-CTTGCTG\nTAGGAGCGGTTCT-30, 252 bp. PCR products were\nanalyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with\nethidium bromide. Images of the gel were captured using\nthe Gel Doc 1000 gel Documentation System from Bio-\nRad (Hercules, CA). Gene expression was then analyzed\nby the IP Lab gel software from Signal Analytics (Vienna,\nVA). Data were expressed as the ratio of specific\nMIF or RANTES/CCL5 mRNA normalized to GAPDH\nmRNA.\n\n2.9. SDS\u2013PAGE and immunoblotting\n\nTo demonstrate activation of p38 and ERK, Western\nblot analysis of protein extracts from HK-2 cells treated\nwith HSA or urine proteins was performed. Twenty micro-\ngrams of protein were subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE, using a\n10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose\nmembranes. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 \ufffdC\nwith PBS containing 5% BSA. The blots were incubated\nfor 1 h with the following primary antibodies: rabbit poly-\nclonal antibody p-p38 and p38; mouse monoclonal anti-\nbody p-ERK; or rabbit polyclonal antibody ERK. After\nincubation with the secondary antibodies (horseradish per-\noxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG or rabbit anti-\nrabbit IgG) for 1 h, protein bands were detected by\nSuper-Signal chemiluminescent substrate.\n\n\n\nMCD FSGS\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n85\n\n100\n\n120\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n1       2        3       4    Marker   5        6       7       8       9      10     11    HSA\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n85\n\n100\n\n120\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n        \n\nFig. 1.

Determination of RANTES levels by ELISA\n\nThe culture media of proximal tubular cells on a 24-well\nplate were collected and stored at \ufffd80 \ufffdC until assay. Con-\ncentrations of RANTES in the culture supernatants of\nHK-2 cells were measured by commercial ELISA kits\naccording to the manufacture\u2019s instructions. All samples\nwere assayed in triplicate and the data were presented as\nmeans \u00b1 SD. The optical density (OD) was measured at\n450 nm and RANTES concentrations were extrapolated\nfrom a standard curve using recombinant human RAN-\nTES. RANTES measurement was also performed on the\nsolutions used to stimulate the cells to exclude the effects\nof contaminant RANTES in urine protein extracts.\n\n2.11. Immunofluorescent staining and confocal laser scanning\n\nmicroscopy\n\nHuman HK-2 cell cultures were fixed in ice acetone for\n10 min, washed and blocked with 5% BSA. Cells were incu-\nbated overnight with anti-MIF or anti-RANTES antibody\nand were then incubated for 45 min with FITC-labeled\ndonkey anti-goat or mouse secondary antibody. Primary\nantibody was replaced with isotype IgG as a negative con-\ntrol. The cells were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-\nphenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI).\n\n2.12. Quantification of cellular MIF and RANTES\n\nexpression by flow cytometry\n\nRANTES and MIF expression on HK-2 cells was eval-\nuated by flow cytometric analysis. Following treatment as\ndescribed above, cells were collected and incubated with\neither FITC-labeled mouse anti-human RANETS and\nMIF monoclonal antibody or an appropriate isotype-\nmatched antibody for 45 min at 4 \ufffdC and then were ana-\nlyzed by FACS (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FA) with Win-\nMDI software (TSRI Cytometry, San Diego, CA). The\nmean specific fluorescence intensity was measured in each\nchannel (10,000 cells/sample). Mean values from three\nmeasurements and standard deviations were determined.\n\n2.13. Statistical analysis\n\nData are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation.\nData were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by\npost hoc least significant difference test. Analyses were per-\nformed using SPSS software 12.0. A P-value of less than\n0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.\n\n3. Result\n\n3.1. Analysis patterns of ultrafiltered urinary proteins from\n\nMCD and FSGS patients in gel electrophoresis\n\nThe composition of ultrafiltered urine proteins was ana-\nlyzed by gel electrophoresis. The results are shown in\nFig. 1. All proteins with Mr of < 5 kDa were removed by\nultrafiltration. Human HSA shows one primary band only,\nwith a molecular weight of approximately 66 kDa. The gel\nrevealed two similar protein band patterns but with some\ndifferences in the protein band range analyzed. The urine\nproteins from both MCD and FSGS patients contained a\nprimary band of proteins with Mr of approximately\n62 kDa, followed by bands with Mr of approximately 83,\n130 and 200 kDa. Both urine protein samples also con-\ntained some protein bands with Mr < 50 kDa. However,\nthe urine proteins from FSGS patients contained several\nremarkable bands with Mr > 250 kDa, but they were not\nremarkable for urine samples from MCD patients.\n\n3.2. Detection of cytokines in urine proteins from MCD or\n\nFSGS patients\n\nExperiments were performed to evaluate six cytokine\nlevels by CBA in the urine proteins of MCD and FSGS\npatients. There was a large variability in the levels of six\ncytokines in urine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients\n(Fig. 2). For both MCD and FSGS patients, the major\ncytokines present in urine proteins were IL-6 and IL-8. In\nMCD patients, there was a 15-fold variability in the uri-\nnary levels of IL-6 and IL-8. The variability was 14- and\n39-folds in FSGS patients. The mean levels of urinary\nIL-6 in MCD and FSGS patients were 76.1 \u00b1 85.9 and\n73.0 \u00b1 71.2 pg/ml, respectively. The mean value for IL-8\nin MCD and FSGS patients was 92.4 \u00b1 92.5 and\n134.4 \u00b1 213.8 pg/ml, respectively. In most MCD and\nFSGS patients, IL-1b, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-a were\nonly detectable by our CBA-based assays (Fig. 2). No sig-\nnificant difference existed between the urinary levels of all\ncytokines tested in FSGS and MCD patients.\n\n\n\nIL-1\u03b2 IL-6 IL-8 IL-10 IL-12p7 TNF-\u03b1\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nC\ny\nto\n\nk\nin\n\ne\n l\n\ne\nv\ne\nl \n\n(p\ng\n\n/m\nl)\n\nFig. 2.

Cytotoxicity of urine proteins from MCD or FSGS\npatients in HK-2 cells\n\nThe urine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients at con-\ncentrations 65.0 mg/ml did not elicit significant cytotoxic-\nity after incubation with HK-2 cells for 72 h (data not\nshown). When the urine protein concentrations increased\nto 10 mg/ml, a marked cytotoxicity was observed. The\nurine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients at 10 mg/ml\ncaused a 52.3% and 56.6% (P < 0.05) reduction of cell sur-\nvival in HK-2 cells, respectively (Fig. 3). HSA at 5 and\n10 mg/ml only slightly reduced the cell proliferation in\nHK-2 cells.\n\nWe further examined the effects of urine proteins from\nMCD and FSGS patients on the lactate dehydrogenase\nleakage in HK-2 cells. After 72 h incubation, the urine pro-\nteins from MCD patients at 1, 5 and 10 mg/ml induced a\n12.3%, 94.7% and 247.3% increase in LDH leakage, respec-\ntively, compared to the control (Fig. 3). The LCD leakage\nin HK-2 cells cotreated with urine proteins from FSGS\npatients at 1, 5 and 10 mg/ml for 72 h was increased by\n76.8%, 137.85% and 249.1%, respectively, compared to\nthe control. The urine proteins from FSGS patients\ninduced a greater leakage of LDH than those from MCD\npatients.\n3.4. Effects of ultrafiltered urine proteins from MCD or\n\nFSGS patients on RANTES and MIF expression in HK-2\ncells\n\nWe first examined the effect of urine protein treatment\non the RANTES and MIF mRNA expression in HK-2 cells\nwhen incubated over 48 h. With exposure of the HK-2 cells\nto ultrafiltered urine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients\nat 5.0 mg/ml over 48 h, the increase of both RANTES and\nMIF mRNA levels was time-dependent, with increasing\ninduction of both genes when the incubation time increased\nover 48 h (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, treatment of HK-2\ncells with 5.0 mg/ml urine proteins from MCD patients for\n3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h significantly increased the expression\nof RANTES and MIF 5.3-, 6.8-, 14.1-, 17.9- and 23.8-fold;\nand 1.7-, 2.0-, 2.0-, 2.8- and 3.5-fold, respectively, com-\npared to the control (zero time incubation) (P < 0.05,\nFig. 4). When the cells were treated with ultrafiltered urine\nproteins from FSGS patients for 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, the\nexpression of RANTES mRNA was significantly increased\n8.3-, 14.4-, 17.5-, 22.5- and 24.1-fold, and the MIF mRNA\nlevels were also significantly increased 2.0-, 3.2-, 4.1-, 4.3-\nand 4.4-fold, respectively, compared to the control (zero\ntime incubation) (P < 0.05, Fig. 4). The urine proteins from\nFSGS patients induced a greater magnitude of both RAN-\nTES and MIF mRNA expression compared to those from\nMCD patients after 6 h incubation up to 48 h (P < 0.05).\n\nWith exposure of the HK-2 cells to ultrafiltered urine\nproteins from MCD or FSGS patients at concentrations\nin the range of 0.1\u201310.0 mg/ml for 24 h, the increase of\nRANTES and MIF mRNA levels was dose-dependent,\nwith a maximal induction at 5\u201310 mg/ml (Fig. 5). The\ninduction of RANTES and MIF by urine proteins from\nMCD and FSGS patients appeared saturable, when the\nconcentrations of urine proteins were greater than 0.1\nand 0.5 mg/ml, respectively.

The urine pro-\nteins from FSGS patients induced a significantly higher\nproduction of RANTES in HK-2 cells compared to those\nfrom MCD patients.\n\nThe marked increase in RANTES and MIF protein lev-\nels in HK-2 cells with exposure to urine proteins from\nMCD or FSGS patients was further confirmed by flow\ncytometric analysis (Fig. 8). The basic levels of RANTES\nand MIF proteins in HK-2 cells were low as determined\nby flow cytometry. HSA treatment induced RANTES\nand MIF production by 230% (P < 0.05) and 39.4%\n(P > 0.05).

Effects of SB203580 and PD98059 on RANTES and\n\nMIF mRNA expression\n\nBecause some controversy exists regarding the specific\nform of MAPK that is necessary and sufficient for produc-\ntion of chemoattractants in response to damage caused by\nurine proteins, we evaluated the effects of two specific\nMAPK inhibitors, PD98059 and SB20358, on urine protein\nmediated chemotaxis of human PTECs. PD98059 at\n50 mM, a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 pathway, almost\ncompletely inhibited urine protein-mediated activation of\nERK1/2. Pretreatment of PD98059 at 50 mM led to signif-\nicant reduction of RANTES and MIF mRNA expression in\ncells exposed to urine proteins from FSGS patients\n(Fig. 10). However, it had no significant inhibitory effect\non elevated RANTES and MIF expression by urine pro-\nteins from MCD patients.\n\n\n\nZ. Huang et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 222\u2013233 231\nOn the other hand, SB20358 at 10 mM, a specific inhib-\nitor of p38 pathway, almost abolished the activation of p38\nmediated by urine proteins in our preliminary experiment.\nIncrease of RANTES and MIF mRNA expression induced\nby urine proteins from MCD or FSGS patients was signif-\nicantly suppressed by pretreatment with SB20358 at\n10 mM. Incubating HK-2 cells with the control vehicle\nalone (0.1% DMSO, v/v) resulted in no significant inhibi-\ntion of both ERK1/2 and p38 expression.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn our study, we extracted the urine protein mixture\nusing ultrafiltration techniques and treated PTECs with\nsuch extract to imitate the overall damage of proximal\ntubule in renal disease in vivo. Ultrafiltration techniques\nhave a number of advantages over other chemical purifica-\ntion techniques, being a less time-consuming process and\nexcluding any chemical and heating processing to maintain\nactivity and integrity of proteins to a maximum extent. The\nurine proteins from both MCD and FSGS patients were\ncarefully processed during lyophilization and ultrafiltration\nto retain the activity of protein molecules and to avoid con-\ntamination and addition of external substances. The resul-\ntant ultrafiltrates are totally different from those from\nplasma in terms of the presence of cytokines and other\npotentially toxic molecules that are secreted by tubular\ncells.\n\nElectrophoretic analysis of the urine protein extracts\nshowed similar band profiles between FSGS and MCD\npatients, with a primary band of proteins with Mr of\napproximately 62 kDa (Fig. 1.). However, the urine\nextracts from FSGS patients contained several marked\nbands with Mr > 250 kDa, but these bands were not appar-\nent for urine samples from MCD patients. It appeared that\nFSGS patients excreted more proteins with a large molec-\nular weight from their urine compared to MCD patients.\n\nSome large molecular proteins such as immunoglobin\nand complement were well known frequently detected in\nnon-selective proteinuria. The urine protein extracts appear\nlargely mimic the composition of glomerular ultrafiltrates\nin tubular lumen in nephrotic syndrome and thus provide\na useful in vitro model for mechanistic study of tubular\ndamage induced by proteinuria.\n\nTo examine the concentrations of six proinflammatory\ncytokines in urine proteins, the CBA technique was\napplied. Our study showed that there was a large variability\nin the levels of six cytokines in urine proteins from MCD or\nFSGS patients (Fig. 2). The major cytokines present in\nurine proteins from both MCD and FSGS patients were\nIL-6 and IL-8, while IL-1b, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-a\nwere only detectable. The urinary cytokines at low concen-\ntrations in MCD and FSGS patients may act as a less\nimportant foster to activate tubular cells in proteinuria.\nRecent evidence suggested that urinary cytokines may be\nsecreted by activated and proliferative glomerular cells\nand correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes [21,22].\nHigh urinary levels of cytokines have been more frequently\ndemonstrated in the patients with proliferative glomerulo-\nnephritis, but not in the patients with non-proliferative glo-\nmerulonephritis such as MCD and FSGS [6]. Urinary\ncytokines, especially TNF-a and IL-6, can be secreted by\nactivated and proliferative glomerular cells [21,22].\n\nOur studies have demonstrated that the urine proteins\nfrom both MCD and FSGS patients at higher concentra-\ntions (>5 mg/ml) significantly inhibited the proliferation\nof HK-2 cells (Fig. 3), which was accompanied by\nincreased leakage of LDH from the cells. Such cytotoxicity\nwas more apparent when the cells were treated with urine\nproteins from FSGS patients compared to those from\nMCD patients. These results are in agreement with previ-\nous studies where exposure to protein overload induces a\ndecrease in proliferation and significant release of LDH\nof tubular cells in vivo and in vitro and protein fractions\ncontaining high molecular weight proteins overload are\nmore cytotoxic [23\u201325]. The mechanism for the cytotoxicity\nof urine proteins may be related to apoptosis induction and\ncell necrosis initiated by toxic substances such as TNF-a\nand other cytokines in the urine.\n\nThrough tubular cells with exposure to urine proteins,\nwe found that urine protein induced significantly elevation\nin expression of RANTES/CCL5 and MIF at both mRNA\nand protein levels (Figs. 4\u20136), which is consistent of previ-\nous studies in the stimulation of single component (e.g.\nalbumin or transferrin) overload in vitro [26,27]. Therefore,\nour study has further confirmed that proteinuria may\ninduce tubulointerstitial damage by activating the synthesis\nof inflammatory mediators and induce intrinsic renal\ntoxicity.\n\nTo check on the protein production of RANTES and\nMIF in HK-2 cells coincubated with urine proteins from\nMCD and FSGS patients, the following techniques were\napplied: ELISA, immunofluorescence microscope and flow\ncytometric analysis. Consistent with increased RANTES\nand MIF mRNA levels, urine proteins from MCD and\nFSGS significantly increased the production of RANTES\nand MIF in HK-2 cells but the latter elicited a greater effect\ncompared to the urine proteins from MCD (Figs. 7 and 8).\nThe distinct effect was considered due to different composi-\ntion of proteins in the urine samples from MCD and FSGS\npatients. Similar to the lack of effect on RANTES and MIF\nmRNA expression, HSA treatment did not significantly\nalter the production of RANTES and MIF by HK-2 cells.\n\nWe observed that the proinflammatory potential of\nurine proteins from FSGS patients appeared to be greater\nthan that of urine proteins from MCD patients because\nof the more significantly elevated levels of RANTES and\nMIF in PTECs induced by urine proteins from FSGS\npatients. The differential effects might be attributed to the\ndifference in the components of urine proteins from FSGS\nand MCD patients. Despite of unknown composition as\nyet, presence of macromolecular proteins in FSGS non-\nselective proteinuria perhaps serve as one of the major\nmechanism. High molecular weight proteins such as immu-\n\n\n\n232 Z. Huang et al. / Cytokine 42 (2008) 222\u2013233\nnoglobin and complement have already been proved to\ninduce the higher expression of chemokine and more signif-\nicant inflammatory activation compared with albumin in\nrenal tubular cells [28,29]. Such evidence perhaps account\nfor the discrepancy over the effect of urine protein between\nFSGS and MCD nephropathy.\n\nTo investigate the mechanism behind the urine protein\ninduced inflammatory activation, we examined the role of\nERK and p38-MAPK pathways in HK-2 cells. Our study\nshowed that treatment of urine proteins from MCD or\nFSGS patients mediated a significantly activation of p38-\nMAPK and ERK (Fig. 9). The result has been supported\nby previous finding that the stimulation of plasma compo-\nnent (e.g. albumin or transferrin) overload activated\nMAPK pathway in cultured tubular cells [30].\n\nTo explore the molecular mechanism for the differential\nchemokine induced turnover in tubular cells, we proceeded\nto apply two widely used specific inhibitors, PD98059 and\nSB203580, in our inhibition studies. Our data shown that\nthe elevated expression of RANTES and MIF induced by\nurine proteins from MCD patients was mediated by p38-\nMAPK pathway but not ERK pathway, while both ERK\nand p38-MAPK pathways were involved in the increased\nMIF and RANTES secretion induced by urine proteins\nfrom FSGS patients. The discrepancies of the intracellular\nsignaling mechanisms may be due to the differential regula-\ntion of some specific components in urine proteins on che-\nmokine secretion. Earlier studies had reported that serum\nIgG, other than albumin or transferrin, could induce and\nincrease IL-6 secretion via early activated of ERK in\nPTECs [31].\n\nPrevious studies have shown that exposure to albumin\ninduced increased expression and secretion of various\nchemokines in tubular cells via activated MAPK path-\nway [31\u201335]. However, in our study, purified albumin\n(5 mg/ml) alone had no or minor effect on up regulation\nof RANTES and MIF expression. Moreover, HSA at\n1 mg/ml failed to effectively activate ERK and p38-\nMAPK pathways [10]. Discrepancies over the effect of\nalbumin in response to protein overload can be attrib-\nuted to differences in experimental design. The concentra-\ntion of albumin (>10 mg/ml) that is required to induce\ninflammatory responses in previous studies exceeded the\nconcentration of albumin in proximal tubular fluid even\nin severe nephrotic syndromes [36\u201338]. Thus, our findings\nfurther confirmed that the stimulation of serum albumin\nshould not be considered as the major factor responsible\nfor tubular cell damage in the progression of tubulointer-\nstitial fibrosis though it is the most abundant component\nin proteinuric conditions.\n\nOur study has important clinical implications. The dif-\nferential production of RANTES and MIF and involve-\nment of p38 and ERK pathways in tubular cells in\nresponse to urine proteins from MCD and FSGS patients\nsuggest that these cytokines and signaling pathways may\nrepresent potential novel therapeutic targets but the thera-\npeutic outcome might be very different. The differential\nchemokine production and p38 and ERK activation\nin vitro by urine proteins from MCD and FSGS patients\nmay be used to predict disease status and progression\nin vivo, although further clinical studies are needed.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that urine proteins\nfrom FSGS induced the significantly higher expression of\nchemokines in tubular epithelial cells compared to urine\nproteins from MCD patients through distinct MAPK-asso-\nciated signaling pathways. Though a comprehensive analy-\nsis of components in urine proteins should be required in\nour further study, it has provided initial evidence that the\nquality of proteinuria plays an important role in eventually\ndetermining the severity and progression of tubular inflam-\nmatory injury associated with different kidney diseases.\nReferences\n\n[1] Remuzzi G, Bertani T.
