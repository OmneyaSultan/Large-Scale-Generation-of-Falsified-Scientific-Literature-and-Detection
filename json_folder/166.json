Introduction\n\nMuscle stem cells, also known as myoblasts, are normally pres-\nent as quiescent satellite cells between the basement membrane\nand the plasma membrane of myofibrils [1]. In response to injury,\nexercise or in pathogenic states, they become activated, re-enter\ncell cycle and start to proliferate actively. Eventually, these prolif-\nerating satellite cells irreversibly withdraw from cell cycles, differ-\nentiate and fuse with existing myofibrils [2]. These sequential\nevents are called muscle regeneration. In this process, the differen-\ntiation of myoblasts is controlled by two families of transcription\nfactors, myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and myocyte enhan-\ncer-binding factor 2(MEF2s) [3], which are regulated by a variety\nof growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), leuke-\nmia inhibitory factor (LIF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), basic\nfibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor\n(PDGF), and transforming growth factor-a [4]. In addition, many\nsignaling pathways, such as Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt and JAK/STATs\nare involved in the regulation of myoblasts differentiation. LIF\nll rights reserved.\n\n2 (K.

The intra-\ncellular signaling pathways responsible for LIF action involve the\nactivation of Jak and/or Tyk kinases. Activated Jak/Tyk phosphory-\nlates (signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1,\nSTAT3 or STAT5) can translocates into the nucleus and transacti-\nvate LIF-responsive genes.\n\nSTAT proteins transduce pivotal biological effects of various\ncytokines and hormones [5]. Among seven STAT family members\n(STAT1-4, 5A, 5B, and 6), STAT3 is activated by several cytokines,\nsuch as the IL-6 family (LIF, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin\nM, IL-11, and cardiotrophin-1), IGF-I, HGF, EGF, PDGF, and bFGF.\nThus, STAT3 plays a central role in the regulation of growth, differ-\nentiation, and survival in many types of cells [6]. For example,\nSTAT3 promotes cell growth through the transcriptional regulation\nof cyclin D1 in fibroblasts [7] and through the transcriptional reg-\nulation of c-myc and Pim1 in hematopoietic cell lines [8\u20139]. In\naddition, STAT3 maintains embryonic stem cells in an undifferen-\ntiated state [10] and inhibits IL-6-induced neuronal differentiation\nin PC12 cells [11]. These data indicate that STAT3 promotes cell\ngrowth and suppresses cell differentiation. However, STAT3 has\nbeen reported to mediate cytokine-induced terminal differentia-\ntion in other cell types, such as IL-6-induced macrophage differen-\ntiation [12], CD40 ligand-induced B-cell differentiation [13],\nOSM-induced differentiation of an osteosarcoma cell line [14],\nciliary neurotrophic factor or OSM-induced astrocyte differentia-\ntion [15,16], and LIF-mediated endothelial differentiation in car-\ndiac stem cells [17]. Therefore, the role of STAT3 in cell growth\n\nmailto:sunluguo@yahoo.com.cn\nmailto:mkwyypxy@163.com\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n138 Y. Yang et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 137\u2013141\nand differentiation is divergent according to the cellular back-\nground and/or the type of cytokines.\n\nHowever, the function of STAT3 signal pathway in regulating\nmyogenesis still remains largely unknown. As a transcriptional\nfactor, STAT3 mediates several biological functions including pro-\nliferation, differentiation, and survival of myoblasts via activating\nits target genes (cyclin D1, c-fos, JunB, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL) [18\u201329],\neither by directly binding to regulatory region of target genes or\nby interacting with other transcriptional factors. It has also been\nreported that the intrinsic muscle-specific transcriptional factors,\nsuch as MyoD, MEF2 and SIX1, play crucial roles in skeletal muscle\ndevelopment in coordination with exogenous growth factors dur-\ning myogenesis. Thus, it is necessary to demonstrate whether\nSTAT3 can induce myogenic differentiation by interacting with\nMyoD, MEF2 or SIX1. MyoD is known to regulate myogenic differ-\nentiation through its transcriptional activities and protein\u2013protein\ninteractions, leading to cell cycle arrest and myoblast differentia-\ntion at the early phase. MEF2 is also capable of directly interacting\nwith members of the MRFs (i.e., MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and\nMRF4) to synergistically activate many muscle-specific genes\n[30,31]. The human SIX1, a member of the SIX classes of homeodo-\nmain genes, is such a transcription factor functioning as a master\nregulatory protein and transactivating the MEF3 site containing\nreporter genes, such as myogenin [32].\n\nTo further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the\nrole of STAT3 in myogenic differentiation, we examined whether\nthe STAT3 protein interacts with these key myogenic regulatory\nfactors. We elucidated the role of STAT3 signal pathway during\nmyogenic differentiation using C2C12 cells, an immortalized myo-\ngenic cell line derived from mouse MSCs [37]. Our results con-\nfirmed that STAT3 is essential for myogenin differentiation. LIF\nmediates muscle cell differentiation by JAK2/STAT3 pathway. In\naddition, STAT3 may also induce myogenin differentiation through\nbiding to another transcription factor, MyoD. These results pro-\nvided a molecular basis for further understanding of the muscle\nregeneration mechanism.\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Cell cultures\n\nMouse MSC-derived C2C12 cells (American Type Culture collec-\ntion, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified\nEagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) with 20% fetal bovine serum (referred\nto herein after as growth medium or GM), 100 U/ml penicillin,\nand 100 lg/ml streptomycin in a 37 \ufffdC incubator with 5% CO2 for\nproliferation. To induce differentiation, growth medium was\nsubstituted by differentiation medium (Dulbecco\u2019s modified\nEagle\u2019s medium containing 2% horse serum, or DM) when cells\nwere near confluent to allow the cells permanently withdraw from\ncell cycles, differentiate and fuse into myotube.\n\n2.2. Reagents and antibodies\n\nLIF was purchased from Chemicon, AG490 from Biomol, HGF\nfrom AMS/Immunoko ntact, and bFGF from Invitrogen. Antibodies\nused include the mouse monoclonal antibodies to actin (Sigma),\nJAK1 (Santa Cruz), STAT3, phosphorylated-STAT3 (Cell Signaling\nTechno logy), MHC (MF20, Developmental studies hybridoma\nbank), MyoD (Phar Mingen), Flag (m2, Sigma).\n\n2.3. Plasmid construction and transfection\n\nVarious expression vectors for Flag-tagged MyD, Flag-tagged\nSIX1 or Flag-tagged MEF2 were constructed by inserting PCR-gen-\nerated cDNA fragments into the mammalian expression vectors of\npcDNA3 (Invitrogen). All constructed clones were verified by\nsequencing. In DM 12 h, 5 \ufffd 104 cells per well were plated onto\n12-well plates to reach 70\u201380% confluence and were transfected\nwith 200 ng of various plasmids as indicated in the figure legends\nusing LipofectAMINE 2000 (Sigma) in according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s instructions. At 48 h after transfection, cells were extracted\nfor coimmunoprecipitation analysis followed by Western blot\nanalysis.\n\n2.4. siRNA and transfection\n\nAll Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized at Dharm-\nacon Inc. Sequences were as follows: for the STAT3 siRNA (human,\nsense), 50GAGUCCAAUGUCCU CUAUC; for the unrelated to STAT3-\nRNAi, 50AGACUUGACACUUCUCG CU; In GM or in DM 36 h,\n5 \ufffd 104 cells per well were plated onto 12-well plates to reach\n70\u201380% confluence. Then cells were transfected with various siR-\nNAs of 100 nmol/L as indicated in the figure legends using Lipofect\nAMINE 2000. At 48 h after transfection, cells in DM 36 h were ex-\ntracted for Western blot analysis, while cells in GM were treated\nwith LIF (20 ng/ml) for 12 h before Western blot analysis.\n\n2.5. Coimmunoprecipitation\n\nTo examine the protein\u2013protein interaction in cultured C2C12\ncells,C2C12 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4,\n150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4,\n1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml aprotinin and 1 mg/ml leupeptin). Four mil-\nligrams of anti-Flag antibody was first incubated with 300 lg of\ncell extracts in RIPA buffer overnight at 4 \ufffdC with rotation; 30 ll\nof protein A-Sepharose beads was then added, and the mixture\nwas incubated at 4 \ufffdC for 1 h with rotation. After extensive wash-\ning with the RIPA buffer, bound proteins were eluted out by boiling\nthen subjected to Western blot analysis.\n\n2.6. Western blot analysis\n\nTo examine expression levels of myosin heavy chain(MHC),\nstat3, phosphorylated-STAT3, b-actin, MyoD, Flag-myoD, Flag-\nMEF2, Flag-SIX1 and JAK1, C2C12 cells lysates in RIPA buffer was\ncentrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min at 4 \ufffdC and the supernatant\nwas used for the experiment. An aliquot (50 lg) of protein was\nseparated by 10% SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)\nand electrotransferred onto 0.2-Am nitrocellulose membrane using\nTowbin transfer buffer (192 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris, 20% metha-\nnol, pH 8.3). The membrane was preincubated with PBS containing\n5% milk, and probed with monoclonal anti-MHC (1:1000), mono-\nclonal anti-actin (1:1000), monoclonal anti-STAT3, monoclonal\nanti-phosphorylated-STAT3 (1:1000), monoclonal anti-MyoD\n(1:1000), monoclonal anti-Flag, and monoclonal anti-JAK1\n(1:1000), in PBS containing 5% milk for 1h at room temperature.\nThe membrane was then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween\n20 and incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase\n(HP)-conjugated secondary antibody. After several washes, the blot\nwas developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent\n(ECL, sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. STAT3 is essential for myogenin differentiation\n\nTo identify signal pathway involved in differentiation process of\nmyogenesis, we examined the expression of STAT3 proteins in\nC2C12 myoblast when the C2C12 myoblast was shifted from GM\n\n\n\nFig. 2.

As shown in Fig. 1A, the expression of STAT3 and\nphosphorylated-STAT3 proteins increased upon differentiation,\ni.e., after the cells were transferred from GM to DM. To further\nidentify the role of STAT3 in myogenin differentiation, we knocked\ndown the endogenous STAT3 with small interference RNA in C2C12\ncells cultured in DM for 36 h (Fig. 1B). Compared to the control\ncells, the myogenic differentiation was markedly blocked in\nSTAT3-siRNA-transfected cells, as demonstrated by Western blot\nshowing the decreased expression of differentiation marker pro-\ntein\u2014myosin heavy chain (MHC). These results suggest that Stat3\nplays a critical role in the process of myogenesis differentiation.\n\n3.2. LIF induces rapid phosphorylation of STAT3 in C2C12 cells\n\nThe progresses of muscle regeneration are regulated by a vari-\nety of growth factors such as LIF, HGF, and bFGF [33,34]. Therefore,\nwe next examined which cytokines that activate STAT3 during\nmuscle differentiation. The C2C12 myoblast cells grown in the\nGM were treated with LIF (20 ng/ml), HGF (20 ng/ml), or bFGF\n(20 ng/ml). Although the expression levels of endogenous JAK1\nprotein or endogenous stat3 protein were comparable between\ncytokine-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2; top and center panels),\nthe levels of phosphorylated-STAT3 proteins were significantly in-\ncreased in LIF-treated cells compared to those treated with HGF or\nbFGF (top panel). These results indicate that LIF activates STAT3 by\ninducing rapid phosphorylation of STAT3.\n\n3.3. Jak2 mediates the effect of LIF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation\nduring myogenic differentiation\n\nTo test whether Jak2 is the down-stream protein of LIF to acti-\nvate STAT3 during normal myogenic differentiation, we assessed\nthe effect of a specific Jak2 inhibitor, AG490, on STAT3 activation\nby LIF in C2C12 cells that has been induced to differentiate in\nDM for 36 h. As shown in Fig. 3, in differentiated C1C12 cells,\nLIF-induced stat3 phosphorylation was repressed by pretreatment\nwith AG490 in a dose-dependent manner. AG490 pretreatment\nalso significantly inhibited myogenic differentiation as indicated\nby decreased expression of Myosin heavy chain (MHC). These\nresults demonstrate that LIF-induced differentiation of myogenesis\nthrough the signal pathway of JAK2/STAT3.\n\n3.4. STAT3 binded with MyoD in the stage of differentiation\n\nTo further elucidate the down-stream molecular mechanism\nunderlying the role of stat3 in myogenic differentiation, we exam-\nFig. 1.

We transfected C2C12 cells with Flag-six1, Flag-\nMEF2, or Flag-myoD when the cells were cultured in DM for\n12 h. Proteins were prepared from the transfected cells, and ana-\nlyzed by coimmunoprecipitation using a flag-specific antibody\nand Western blot with an anti-stat3 antibody (Fig. 4; the top\npanel). As shown in Fig. 4 (the second top panel), stat3 protein\nwas detected in the cells transfected Flag-myoD, but not in those\ntransfected with Flag-MEF2 or Flag-six1. The data indicate that\nmyoD, but not MEF2 or six1, can directly interact with stat3 in\nmyogenic differentiation.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIt is important to understand the molecular mechanisms regu-\nlating muscle regeneration, a process involving proliferation, dif-\nferentiation, and survival of myoblasts. STAT3, a well-known\nfactor for its critical roles in transducing various and important\nbiological effects [5], has been found to be expressed in muscle,\nbut its role during muscle differentiation is poorly defined. By\nusing C2C12 cell-based in vitro muscle differentiation model, we\nfirst proved that both the expression level and activation of STAT3\nincrease upon C2C12 cells differentiation. We also showed that\nLIF-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signal transduction pathway induces\nmyogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we found that STAT3 could\ndirectly interact with myoD, suggesting that myoD might be in-\nvolved in STAT3-induced myogenic differentiation.\nFig. 3. Jak2 specially mediated the effect of STAT3 during myogenic differentiation.\nAG490, a specific Jak2 inhibitor, was able to inhibit STAT3 activation induced by LIF.\nAfter cells were pretreated with AG490 in a dose-dependent manner as indicated\nfor 30 min and then treated with LIF (20 ng/ml) for 24 h, the level of expression of\nphosphorylated-stat3 (the top panel) decreased. And the differentiation of the cells\nwas determined by examining the expression of MHC protein as indicated (the\ncenter panel).\n\n\n\nFig. 4. STAT3 bonded with myoD in the stage of differentiation. C2C12 cell were\nrespectively transfected with Flag-six1, Flag- MEF2 or Flag-myoD. Twelve hours\nafter transfection, cells extracts were subjected to coimmunoprecipitated with\nantibodies against anti-Flag antibody. First the immunoprecipitated (IP) Flag-six1,\nFlag-MEF2, Flag-myoD were detected by Western blot (WB) with anti-Flag antibody\n(the top panel).The transfected plasmids all existed in the cells. Next, the cells\nlysates were subjected to WB with antibodies against stat3 (the second top panel).\nStat3 protein was detected only in the cells transfected Flag-myoD. Furthermore,\nthe cells lysates were subjected to WB with antibodies against endogenous stat3 or\nendogenous actin. The levels of the endogenous stat3 and endogenous actin were\nequal revealed by WB (two bottom panels).\n\n140 Y. Yang et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 137\u2013141\nThe role for STAT3 in myoblast differentiation was further con-\nfirmed by STAT3 knockdown experiment using siRNA, in which\ndeliberate knockdown of endogenous STAT3 dramatically blocked\nmyogenic differentiation. The role of STAT3 in cell growth and dif-\nferentiation is divergent according to the cellular background, the\ntype of cytokines that activates STAT3 and the type of nuclear pro-\nteins that interacts with STAT3. It has been reported that STAT3\ninduces differentiation in some cell lines such as macrophage,\nB-cell, osteosarcoma cell line, astrocyte and cardiac stem cells\n[12\u201317], but suppresses differentiation and promotes cell growth\nin others [7\u201311].\n\nWe observed that LIF-activated JAK2/STAT3 induces myogenic\ndifferentiation. However, a previous report showed that LIF-med-\niated ERK phosphorylation inhibits myogenic differentiation [35].\nIn this study, the inhibitory effect of LIF was detected only in the\nfirst 12 h after the cells are incubated in the DM, which is STAT3-\nindependnt. Thus, it possible that LIF might play distinct roles in\ndifferent stages of muscle differentiation. Cytokines may require\ncritical time frame to mediate activation of signal pathway. For\nexample, there is a critical time window (16\u201320 h) for bFGF to\nactivate ERK and to repress myogenic gene expression and differ-\nentiation [36]. These data raise a possibility that LIF may inhibit\nmuscle differentiation by ERK pathway at the early stage (within\n12 h), but enhance differentiation through JAK2/STAT3 pathway\nlater.\n\nSTAT3, as a key signal transducer and activator of transcription,\nhas been shown to interact with various nuclear proteins and\ntransduce important biological effects in many cell lines. SIX1,\nMEF2 and MyoD are key myogenic regulatory factors inducing plu-\nripotent precursor cells differentiation. So we tested whether they\nwere involved in stat3 mediated myogenic differentiation. The re-\nsults showed that stat3 could interact with myoD, but not SIX1 or\nMEF2 in C2C12 cells in DM for 12 h, suggesting that STAT3-MyoD\nbinding may be responsible for the stimulatory effect of STAT3\non myogenic differentiation. Further studies are needed to under-\nstand how STAT3 coordinates with myoD to control myogenic\ndifferentiation and how they cross-talk with other signaling path-\nways. Taken together, our data suggest a possibility to accelerate\nmuscle regeneration by modulating STAT3 pathways.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by a Grant from National Nature Sci-\nence Foundation of China (No. 30671091) and another Grant from\nNational Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 30600098).\nReferences\n\n[1] Rawls A, Olson EN.
