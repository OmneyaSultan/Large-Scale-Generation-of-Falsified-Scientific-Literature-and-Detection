This work studies the involvement of the cytokine in the observed changes in the pump. Rats were injected\nintraperitoneally with 400 mg of IL-1b and 4 h later, the heart was isolated and a crude homogenate of the right and left ventricles\nwas prepared and tested for Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase activity and protein expression. IL-1b inhibited by around 70% the activity of the\n\nATPase in the left and right ventricles. This inhibition of the pump was ascribed to a decrease in its protein expression as\ndemonstrated by western blot analysis. A dose and time response study conducted on isolated cardiac myocytes confirmed the\ninhibitory role of the cytokine on the ATPase and showed that IL-1b exerts its maximal down-regulatory effect at 2 h and at a dose\nof 20 ng/ml. The cytokine caused also an up-regulation of the NaKCl2 cotransporter. Both MEK and p38MAPK were shown to be\ninvolved in the signaling pathway activated by the cytokine. It can be concluded that the decrease in the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase\n\nconcentration observed in heart diseases is a consequence of the accompanying high levels of IL-1b, and may be responsible for the\ndifferent symptoms that accompany cardiac ischemia.\n\n\ufffd 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nThere has been an increasing body of evidence\nsupporting the existence of an inflammatory component\nin both the development and progression of heart failure\n[1,2]. Cytokines, in particular TNF-alpha, IL-1 and\nIL-6, have been identified as major players in the\npathogenesis of the disease, and in the failing heart, an\nincrease in their circulating levels has been noted that\ncorrelates with the severity of the symptoms and a worse\nprognosis [3,4]. These inflammatory mediators [5] have\nbeen shown, in addition, to induce cardiac hypertrophy\nand exert a negative inotropic effect on the perfused\nheart [6,7].\n\nHeart failure coupled with ischemia and myocardial\nhypertrophy were associated in turn with a decrease in\n\n) Corresponding author.

The glycosides inhibit the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\n\npump, increase intracellular sodium, and reduce the\nsodium electrochemical gradient that constitutes the\ndriving force for calcium extrusion through the Na\n\nC\n/\n\nCa\nCC\n\nexchanger, leading thus to an increase in intra-\ncellular calcium content, and consequently enhanced\ncontractility.\n\nThe Na\nC\n-K\n\nC\npump is a heterodimer composed of an\n\na catalytic subunit and a b glycoprotein subunit. Many\nisoforms of each subunit have been detected and are\nexpressed in a tissue-specific manner [11].

Kreydiyyeh et al. / Cytokine 26 (2004) 1e8\nin humans all three isoforms 1, 2 and 3 are present [9].\nSchwinger et al. [12] demonstrated a decrease in the\nprotein expression of the a1 and a3 subunits by, re-\nspectively, 38 and 30% in human failing hearts while\nthe activity decreased by 42%.\n\nIn addition to glycosides, loop-diuretics are also used\nin the treatment of heart failure [13]. They are thought\nto alleviate pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure\nand hypertension by inhibiting the renal NaKCl2\ncotransporter and promoting diuresis and natriuresis.\nMany other reports showed, however, that the clinical\nrelief of symptoms preceded in many instances the onset\nof diuresis [14,15] and occurred even in presence of\nmarked impairment of renal function [16,17] suggesting\na direct effect of the loop-diuretics on the cardiomyo-\ncytes NaKCl2 cotransporter [18]. It is well known that\nthe activity of this transporter is geared by the sodium\ngradient established by the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase.\n\nRegulation of Na\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase seems thus to be\n\ncritical for a proper functioning of the myocardium and\nany impairment in its activity is expected to result in\nchanges in the electrochemical gradient that drives the\nsodium influx and calcium extrusion leading to alter-\nations in the contraction/relaxation processes.\n\nAlthough in heart failure, changes in the Na\nC\n-\n\nK\nC\nATPase activity and expression were noted to\n\naccompany increases in circulating levels of IL-1b, the\npresence of a causeeeffect relationship between the\ncytokine and the pump has not been properly in-\nvestigated.\n\nBecause we have shown previously that IL-1-b de-\ncreases the protein expression of the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase in\n\nthe rat kidney and intestine [19,20] and up-regulates the\nNaKCl2 cotransporter, we speculate that this pro-\ninflammatory cytokine may exert a similar effect in\ncardiac myocytes.\n\nThe aim of this work was to study the effect of IL-1b\non the activity and protein expression of the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\n\nATPase and NaKCl2 symporter in the rat heart using\ntwo different approaches: treating the whole animal with\nthe cytokine or isolating myocytes and then treating\nthem with IL-1b.\n\n2.

Effect of IL-1b on the Na\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase\n\nof myocytes isolated from treated animals\n\nBecause the ventricular homogenate is a mixture of\ndifferent types of cells, the observed change in the\nATPase activity and expression may not reflect neces-\nsarily changes in cardiomyocytes. To clarify this point\ncardiomyocytes were isolated from animals treated with\nIL-1b, and the activity and protein expression of the\nATPase was studied in a homogenate of these isolated\ncells rather than in a homogenate of the whole ventricle.\nIL-1b caused down-regulation of the pump in isolated\ncardiomyocytes (Fig. 3) and inhibited its activity (Fig. 4)\nby around 85%.\n\nFig. 1.

Discussion\n\nThis work has used three different approaches to\nstudy the effect of IL-1b on the rat cardiac NaC-\nK\n\nC\nATPase. The first involved treating the animals with\n\nthe cytokine and then studying ATPase activity and\nprotein expression in homogenates of the right and left\nventricles. In the second approach, animals were treated\nwith the cytokine and then cardiomyocytes were isolated\nand a cell lysate prepared and used in the study of\nthe ATPase. The third approach consisted of isolating\nthe cardiomyocytes and then treating them with the\ncytokine.\n\nIL-1b reduced the protein expression of the a1\nsubunit of the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase in right and left\n\nventricular homogenates and exerted a significant in-\nhibition of the ATPase activity which correlated with its\ndown-regulatory effect and could thus be ascribed to the\n\nFig. 6. Dose and time response study on the effect of IL-1b on the\n\nNa\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase activity in isolated myocytes treated with the\n\ncytokine. Values are means G SEM of six observations. *P! 0:05;\n**P! 0:01.\ndecrease in the number of the catalytic a1 subunits.\nSince the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase in the ventricular homoge-\n\nnates is derived from a mixture of different cells (endo-\nthelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts), the observed\nchanges in the protein expression and activity of the\npump are due to the net effect of the cytokine on the cell\nmixture and not on the myocytes in particular.\n\nTo know the exact effect of IL-1b on cardiac\nmyocytes, a pure population of cardiomyocytes was\nprepared from rats treated with IL-1b, and was used to\nstudy changes in Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase activity and protein\n\nexpression. The results reconfirmed the down-regulatory\neffect of the cytokine on the ATPase as well as the\ninhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity.\n\nAn inflammatory response is the result of a cytokine\ncascade, where one cytokine leads to the release of\nanother until the final response is elicited. Thus IL-1b,\na pro-inflammatory cytokine, when injected to rats, may\nhave exerted its effect directly on myocytes or indirectly\nby acting on other target cells and causing the release of\nother cytokines or inflammatory mediators. To elucidate\nthis point, cardiomyocytes were isolated and then\ntreated in vitro with IL-1b. The inhibitory effect of the\ncytokine appeared in this case also, demonstrating that\nIL-1b exerts its effect on the myocyte ATPase inde-\npendent of any influence from neighboring tissues as\nmay occur in vivo in the whole animal.\n\nBecause IL-1b is known to signal through the MAPK\ncascade [21,22] we investigated the involvement of these\nkinases in the signal transduction pathway activated by\nIL-1b. PD98059 and SB202190, respective inhibitors of\nMEK and p38 MAPK, abrogated the effect of IL-1b on\nthe protein expression of the a1 subunit, inferring that\nboth MAPKs are involved in the signaling pathway. The\nresults are in agreement with those reported by Ng et al.\n[23] who showed an implication of ERK and p38\nMAPKs in the IL-1b-induced delayed phosphorylation\nof STAT3 in cardiac myocytes.\n\nSince the observed inhibition of the Na\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase\n\nby IL-1b was accompanied by down-regulation of its\n\n\n\n5S.I.

The blot is representative of an experiment repeated three times. Protein expression of b actin was used to check for equal loading.\ncatalytic a1 subunit, it may be attributed, at least\npartially, to a decrease in the number of enzyme\nmolecules. Such an inhibition is expected to decrease\nthe sodium gradient and sodium-dependent electrolyte\nmovements that regulate excitationecontraction cou-\npling in cardiac myocytes especially calcium movements.\nCytosolic calcium increases during contractions and is\nrestored back to normal levels upon relaxation via the\nNa\n\nC\n-Ca\n\nCC\nexchanger whose activity is dependent on\n\nthe sodium gradient established by the Na\nC\n-K\n\nC\npump.\n\nAn inhibition of the pump is thus expected to dissipate\nthe sodium gradient, inhibit the Na\n\nC\n-Ca\n\nCC\nantiporter,\n\nincrease cytosolic calcium and by so doing alter the\nsystolicediastolic cycle and delay relaxation. In fact,\ninhibition of the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase has been reported in\n\nsome cases of heart failure [24,25] and was associated\nwith increases in the levels of pro-inflammatory cyto-\nkines. Similarly increases in cytosolic calcium were\nreported to occur in association with increases in the\nlevels of IL-1b and TNF-a [26]. The demonstrated\ninhibitory effect of IL-1b on the pump may thus provide\na possible explanation of the previously reported\nincrease in cytosolic calcium levels [27,28] that occur in\nmyocytes following IL-1b treatment and whose cause\nremained controversial. We provide here a plausible\nexplanation by attributing it indirectly to an inhibition\nof the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\npump and consequently to the Na\n\nC\n/\n\nCa\nCC\n\nexchanger. Although our data lend support to\nthis hypothesis, it still needs to be confirmed by further\nexperimental work.\n\nThe inhibition of the pump is expected also to alter\nthe function of the Na\n\nC\n/H\n\nC\nexchanger which regulates\n\nintracellular pH and the activity of which is dependent\non the sodium gradient generated by the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nAT-\n\nPase. IL-1b is thus expected to increase intracellular\nacidity, a process that has already been reported in the\nischemic heart where pHi and pHo were noted to reach\nvalues as low as 6.0 and 6.5, respectively [29,30].\n\nThis work showed that IL-1b reduced the activity of\nthe Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase but up-regulated the NaKCl2\n\ncotransporter. A change in the Na\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase activity\n\nis known to elicit always a change of an opposite nature\nin the activity of the NaKCl2 cotransporter [31]. This is\nconsistent with our findings which are also in line with\nFig. 8. Effect of IL-1b on the protein expression of the NaKCl2 cotransporter in ventricular homogenates prepared from treated animals with the\n\ncytokine. Protein loaded: 150 mg. The blot is representative of an experiment repeated three times. Protein expression of b actin was used to check for\n\nequal loading.\n\n\n\n6 S.I. Kreydiyyeh et al. / Cytokine 26 (2004) 1e8\nFig. 9. Effect of IL-1b on the protein expression of the NaKCl2 cotransporter in a homogenate of isolated myocytes treated with the cytokine. The\n\nblot is representative of an experiment repeated three times. Protein expression of b actin was used to check for equal loading.\nthose of Liu et al. [31] who reported an induced\nstimulation of the NaKCl2 transporter by ouabain, an\ninhibitor of the pump.\n\nA stimulation of the NaKCl2 cotransport is known to\ninduce cell swelling [32,33] and Clemo and Baumgarten\n[34] ascribed the observed decrease in the volume of\natrial myocytes by ANP to an inhibition of the\ncotransporter. On the other hand, cell swelling and high\nlevels of IL-1b were reported to accompany myocardial\nischemia [35], but the causes of the changes in cell\nvolume remained unidentified. Our findings may pro-\nvide an explanation, by attributing it to an up-regulation\nof the NaKCl2 cotransporter.\n\nIt can be concluded that many of the symptoms of\nheart failure may be ascribed to the effect of IL-1b on\ncardiomyocytes. By inhibiting the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase, the\n\ncytokine increases intracellular sodium and inhibits the\nNa\n\nC\n-H\n\nC\nand Na\n\nC\n-Ca\n\nCC\nexchangers resulting in a de-\n\ncrease in pHi and an increase in cytosolic calcium that\nmay lead to alterations in the systolicediastolic cycle. The\ninhibition of the pump would lead also to up-regulation\nof the NaKCl2 cotransporter resulting in cell swelling,\na prominent feature of ischemic cardiomyocytes.\n\nThe Na\nC\n-K\n\nC\npump constitutes thus an important\n\ntarget site of action for IL-1b, and many of the reported\ncytokine actions are mediated through an effect on this\nATPase.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that although this work\nprovides some possible explanations to the symptoms\nthat accompany heart failure, still more experimental\nwork needs to be conducted to confirm them and\nestablish the direct or indirect implication of IL-1 b in\nthe disease. The long term effect of the cytokine on heart\nfunctions and Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase activity would also need\n\nto be investigated.\n\n4. Materials and methods\n\nMale SpragueeDawley rats (Rattus norvegicus)\nweighing 150e200 g were handled all through in\naccordance with the Guide for Laboratory Animal\nFacilities and Care, US Department of Health, Educa-\ntion and Welfare.\n\n4.1. Animal treatment\n\nAnimals were injected i.p. with 400 ng IL-1b and 4 h\nlater, the heart was isolated. These doses were chosen\nbased on a previous study on the effect of this cytokine\non the Na\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\npump in intestines and kidneys.\n\nControl animals received instead, an equal volume of\nphysiological saline (200 ml).\n\nFour hours after the injection of the cytokine, the\nheart was excised and placed in ice cold Ca\n\nCC\n-free\n\nperfusion buffer containing: 113 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM\nKCl, 0.6 mM KH2PO4, 0.6 mM Na2HPO4, 1.2 mM\nMgSO4\ufffd7H2O, 12 mM NaHCO3, 12 mM KHCO3,\n20 mM D-glucose, 10 mM Na\n\nC\n-Hepes, 2 mM creatine,\n\n2 mM carnitine, non-essential amino acids, pH= 7.2 at\n37 (C, cannulated via the aorta and perfused with the\nsame buffer for 4 min at 37 (C. The buffer was oxy-\ngenated with 95%O2, 5%CO2 throughout the perfusion\nstep. The left and right ventricles were then isolated and\nhomogenized in Tris buffer containing: 200 mM NaCl;\n5 mM MgCl2\ufffd6H2O; 2 mM EGTA; 5 mM KCl; 200 mM\nTriseHCl, pH 7.4. Aliquots of the homogenate were\nwithdrawn for western blot analysis or to assay for the\nNa\n\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase activity.\n\n4.2. Myocyte isolation and treatment\n\nMyocytes were isolated as described by Hilal-Dandan\net al. [36], suspended in oxygenated M 119 medium (pH\n7.2) (0.5e1 million cells per ml) supplemented with\npenicillin (100 mg/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), 1 ml/ml\nleupeptin and 0.1% BSA and incubated with different\nconcentrations of IL-1b for different time periods at\n37 (C.\n\nWhen the involvement of MAP kinases was tested,\nPD98059 and SB202190, respective inhibitors of MEK\nand p38 MAP kinase were added to the cells at a final\n\n\n\n7S.I. Kreydiyyeh et al. / Cytokine 26 (2004) 1e8\nconcentration of 50 mM, 15min prior to the addition of\nIL-1b. At the end of the incubation period, cells were\ncollected by a 5 min centrifugation at 1500g and 4 (C.\n\n4.3. Western blot analysis\n\nCrude membrane homogenates were prepared by lysis\nand homogenization of the myocytes followed by two\nconsecutive 4 min spins at 1000g and 3300g and 4 (C.\nMembrane proteins were determined using the Bio-Rad\nprotein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2000 Alfred Nobel\nDrive, Hercules, CA 94547 USA), and equal loads were\n(30 mg) resolved on 8%polyacrylamide gels using aMini-\nProtean 3 System (Bio-Rad, CA,USA) and transferred to\na PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The PVDF\nmembrane was then washed, blocked and incubated\novernight at 4 (C with a rabbit polyclonal anti-NaC/\nK\n\nC\nATPase a-1 IgG (Upstate biotechnology, Lake\n\nPlacid, NY 12946), or with an anti-rat sodium potassium\nchloride cotransporter antibody (Alpha Diagnostic In-\nternational, TX, USA). Detection of the signal was by\nenhanced chemiluminescence using luminol reagent\n(Santa Cruiz Biotechnology Inc., CA, USA)\n\n4.4. Na\nC\n-K\n\nC\nATPase assay\n\nCrude myocyte membrane homogenates and ventric-\nular homogenates were diluted in Tris buffer (200 mM\nNaCl; 5 mM MgCl2\ufffd6H2O; 2 mM EGTA; 5 mM KCl;\n200 mM TriseHCl, pH 7.4) to a respective concentra-\ntion of 0.1 mg and 1 mg protein/ml. Homogenates were\nincubated with saponin (0.02%) for 30 min at room\ntemperature, then 50 ml aliquots were re-incubated at\n37 (C for 10 min in the presence or absence of ouabain\n(4 mM final concentration). The reaction was then\ninitiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration\nof 1.25 mM and terminated after a 1 h incubation at\n37 (C by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (200 ml,\n11%). The samples were centrifuged at 3000g for 5 min\nand the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated in the\nsupernatant was measured colorimetrically according to\nthe method of Taussky and Shorr [37]. The activity of\nthe enzyme was determined by measuring the ouabain-\ninhibitable inorganic phosphate liberated and percent\ninhibition was calculated as follows:\n\n1\ufffd\nPi\u00f0IL1b\u00de \ufffd Pi\u00f0IL1b\u00fe ouabain\u00de\n\nPi\u00f0control\u00de \ufffd Pi\u00f0control\u00fe ouabain\u00de\n!100:\n\n4.5. Statistical analysis\n\nResults of the enzymatic assay were reported as\nmeans G SEM. Statistical significance was tested by a\nStudent t-test or a one-way analysis of variance followed\nby a TukeyeKramer multiple comparisons test.\nChanges in the protein expression were reported as\npercentages of the control values using the gel-Pro\nanalyzer(2) software.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the\nUniversity Research Board.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Mann DL.
