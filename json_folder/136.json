These autoantibodies may cross-react with the corresponding PNA or their epitops present in neurons and\nthus initiate the development of a variety of neurological disorders, paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS), even though the\nprimary tumor and its metastases have not invaded the nervous system. Cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a\nrare ocular PNS induced by autoantibodies against several retinal antigens, one of which is a photoreceptor\ncalcium-binding protein, recoverin. Only several CAR patients with a few kinds of cancer (endothelial carcinoma,\nbreast cancer, epithelial ovarian carcinoma) have so far been found to contain autoantibodies against recoverin in\ntheir sera. As for lung cancer, the majority of CAR cases mediated by anti-recoverin autoantibodies have been\nrevealed in patients with the most malignant lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and only one similar case\nhas been described for a patient with non-small lung carcinoma. The common feature of all these anti-recoverin-pos-\nitive patients, irrespective of the type of cancer, is the presence of both the CAR syndrome and high titres (as a rule,\nmore than 1:1000) of the underlying autoantibodies in their serum.

Introduction\n\nParaneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS)\nare rare neurological disorders that are related to\ncancer, even though the primary tumor and its\nmetastases have not invaded the nervous system.\nPNS are thought to be autoimmune diseases that\ndevelop when malignant tumors express proteins,\nparaneoplastic antigens (PNA), which are nor-\nmally present only in neurons. PNA expression\noutside the nervous system triggers the host\u2019s\nimmune response toward the corresponding PNA\nor their epitops present in neurons, resulting in\nthe development of PNS [1]. One of the PNS is\ncancer-associated retinopathy (CAR), a paraneo-\nplastic ocular disorder characterized by progres-\nsive retinal degeneration and as a result by a loss\nof vision [2].\n\nThe first indication that the retinal protein with\nan apparent molecular weight 23-kDa could be \u2018a\nCAR antigen\u2019 was obtained by Thirkill [2]. More\nrecently [3] the CAR antigen was shown to be\nhomologous to a retinal Ca2+-binding protein,\np26 or recoverin, almost simultaneously discov-\nered by our and other groups [4\u20136]. Four poten-\ntial Ca2+-binding sites of the EF-hand type are\npresent in a recoverin molecule of which only two\n(the 2nd and the 3rd ones) are capable of binding\ncalcium ions [5,7]. The immunopathogenic region\nof recoverin (residues 64\u201370) is contained within\nthe 2nd EF-hand structure [8].\n\nOnly a small number of CAR patients with a\nfew kinds of cancer (endothelial carcinoma [9],\nbreast cancer [10], epithelial ovarian carcinoma\n[11]) have so far been found to contain anti-recov-\nerin autoantibodies (RAbs) in their serum. As for\nlung cancers, the majority of RAbs-positive CAR\ncases have been revealed in patients with the most\nmalignant lung tumor of neuroendocrine origin,\nsmall cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [2,3,8,12,13];\n\nonly one similar case has been described for a\npatient with non-small lung carcinoma [14], the\ntumor of bronchial epithelial origin.\n\nIt should be stressed that the common feature\nof all anti-recoverin-positive patients described\nearlier, irrespective of the type of cancer, is the\npresence of both the CAR syndrome and high\ntitres (as a rule, more than 1:1000) of the underly-\ning autoantibodies in their serum [2,3,9\u201314]. In\nthis study, we have used recombinant myristoy-\nlated recoverin to screen serum samples of 50\npatients with SCLC by Western blot and have\nrevealed five patients with low titres \u2014 from 1:20\nto 1:160 \u2014 of anti-recoverin antibodies, who\nhave no manifestation of a loss of vision. None of\nsera of the other 45 patients with SCLC and of 30\nhealthy individuals contain RAbs.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report on the\npresence of low titre autoantibodies against recov-\nerin in a serum of patients with cancer, but with-\nout any evidence of visual dysfunction.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\nSerum samples were prepared from whole\nblood of 50 patients with SCLC and of 30 healthy\nindividuals and stored at \u221270\u00b0C. Normal pooled\nhuman sera were used as a negative control.\n\nRecombinant myristoylated recoverin was ob-\ntained according to [15] and was used in Western\nblot analysis (see below). Rabbit polyclonal\n(monospecific) anti-recoverin antibodies were pre-\npared as described in [4,5] and were used as a\npositive control in Western blot analysis.\n\nWestern blot analysis was performed with rock-\ning at room temperature after SDS-PAGE [16] of\nrecombinant myristoylated recoverin (2 \ufffdg per\ntrack) in 12% gel. The gel slabs were electrotrans-\nferred to Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose mem-\n\n\n\nA.V. Bazhin et al. / Lung Cancer 34 (2001) 99\u2013104 101\n\nbranes (Amersham) in Tris\u2013glycine\u2013methanol\nbuffer, pH 8.3. Then nonspecific sites were satu-\nrated by incubation for 1.5 h with 10% solution of\ndelipidated powdered milk and membranes were\nincubated for 12 h with: (i) a serum of SCLC\npatients; (ii) a serum of healthy individuals as a\nnegative control (initial dilution was 1:20 in both\ncases); and (iii) rabbit\u2019s polyclonal (monospecific)\nanti-recoverin antibodies (1 \ufffdg/ml) as a positive\ncontrol. All incubations were performed in buffer\nB (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl,\n0.05% TWEEN-20, 1 mM CaCl2). Blots were\nrinsed three times (each for 10 min) with buffer B,\nincubated for 1.5 h with sheep anti-human IgG\nperoxidase conjugate (Amersham) at dilution of\n1:500 with buffer B, rinsed again with 50 mM\nTris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6 and finally incubated with 10\nmM 3,3\ufffd-diaminobenzidine as a substrate in 0.01%\nhydrogen peroxide.\n\n3. Results\n\nIn the process of raising antibodies against\nrecoverin, we measured a level of the antibodies in\nthe serum of two rabbits after recoverin injection\nand found that the maximal levels were different\nin each animal. Investigation of an eye bottom\nand light microscopy of retina slices detected reti-\nnal degeneration in the rabbit with a high titre of\nthe antibodies, whereas the eye characteristics of\nthe rabbit with the low titres did not differ from\nthose of the control animals (data not shown).\nThe finding that anti-recoverin antibodies circu-\nlated in the blood stream of the experimental\nanimal without causing retina degeneration stimu-\nlated us to screen serum samples of patients with\nSCLC irrespective of the presence of the CAR\nsyndrome in them.\n\nWe have screened 50 patients with diagnosis\nSCLC and revealed five patients with RAbs in\ntheir sera before treatment (Fig. 1 and Table 1); in\nnone of the cases a loss of vision has been mani-\nfested. When \u2018exogeneous\u2019 recoverin was used as a\ncompetitor for RAbs binding to recoverin on the\nblot, the intensity of the reaction was supressed in\nan exogeneous recoverin-dependent manner (not\nshown). None of serum samples of the other 45\n\npatients with SCLC and of 30 healthy individuals\ninvestigated as a negative control contain RAbs.\n\nDetermination of the RAbs titres in the RAbs-\npositive patients mentioned gave values in the\nrange between 1:20 and 1:160. It is interesting to\nnote that chemotherapy caused disappearance of\nRAbs from the blood stream of 3 patients investi-\ngated. In one case (patient coded \u2018SCLC-4\u2019), when\nthe analysis was repeated 3 months after the last\ncourse of chemotherapy, RAbs appeared again in\nthe patient\u2019s serum (see Table 1).\n\nThe example of the RAbs titre determination in\npatient SCLC-4 is shown in Fig. 2. One can see\nthat the intensity of staining of the recoverin\nbands decreases with the increase of the serum\ndilution. The band can be detected at the dilution\nbetween 1:10 and 1:80, but it fully disappears at\nfurther dilution; the titre of RAbs in this case is\nestimated at 1:40.\n\n4. Case report\n\nIn all five RAbs-positive cases revealed, the\ndiagnosis of the extensive stage of SCLC was\nestablished by physical examination, plain chest\nradiography, bronchoscopy with brushed biopsy\nwith the subsequent histological and cytology\nanalyses. The visual acuity of all the patients\nremained immutable in comparison with that be-\nfore the disease and during the whole observation\nperiod. However, only one patient coded as\n\nFig. 1.

That is why the description of patient\nSCLC-4 is the only one presented in Section 4.\n\nPatient SCLC-4, a 58-year-old man was admit-\nted to the Pulmonology Research Institute,\nMoscow in June 2000. He had been smoking 40\ncigarettes per day for 48 years. First symptoms of\nthe disease appeared 3 months before the diagno-\nsis of SCLC. He complained of a cough with\nmucopurulent sputum, fever about 37\u00b0C, exer-\ntional dyspnea, a loss of voice and progressive\nweakness. At the moment of the 1st blood sam-\npling for the RAbs analysis, the diagnosis was the\nextensive stage of SCLC. The tumor obturated\nthe left upper lobe bronchus involving the left\nmain bronchus and did not reach the carina to 3\ncm. There were methastases into ipsilateral hilar\nlymphatic nodes, ipsilateral and contralateral me-\ndiastinal nodes, ipsilateral supraclavicular\nlymphatic nodes and pancreas. The patient had\nno loss of vision before the disease and during the\nwhole observation period. Ophtalmological inves-\ntigation was carried out about 5 months after the\ndiagnosis at the moment of the last serum sam-\npling when the RAbs titre was equal to 1:40 (see\nTable 1). The patient\u2019s visual acuity was deter-\nmined as OD 0.5 and OS 1.0. Ophtalmoscopy\nrevealed the retina and optic nerve to be normal\nin appearance. Reaction of pupils to light was\n\nnormal. The patient had no narrowing of the\nvisual field (Fig. 3). Thus, the manifestation of\nretina degeneration was not found.\n\n5. Discussion\n\nThe symptoms of PNS can be manifested long\nbefore the clinical diagnosis of the underlying\ntumor, thus enabling the clinician to predict the\nfuture development of a particular cancer [17]. It\nis postulated that the reason for the PNS develop-\nment is an expression of PNA in the tumor local-\nized outside the nervous system that triggers an\nimmune response toward the corresponding PNA\npresent in neurons [1]. PNS are shown to be\n\nFig. 2.

Goldmann visual fields of RAbs-positive patient SCLC-4.\n\nassociated with different tumors, one of which is\nthe most malignant lung tumor, SCLC. Although\na number of PNS is developed in patients with\nSCLC, their frequency is quite rare: the total\namount of various PNS associated with SCLC is\nestimated at 4% [18]. One of the most extensively\nstudied groups of PNA is a family of Hu antigens,\nautoantibodies against which underlie a multifo-\ncal neurological disease, paraneoplastic sensory\nneuropathy [19]. The frequency of PNS in anti-\nHu-positive patients with SCLC having high titres\nof the autoantibodies and corresponding PNS, is\nequal only to 1% [20]. However, SCLC patients\nwith low titres of anti-Hu autoantibodies and\nwithout PNS have been found, and the frequency\nof these cases lying in the range of 15\u201320% [21], is\nfar above that of the high titre anti-Hu cases. The\npresence of anti-PNA antibodies in the absence of\nPNS syndromes has also been demonstrated for\nYo and Ri antigens, but here autoantibodies were\ndetected only in 2\u20134% of the patients [22].In\nregard to recoverin, to our knowledge, this study\nis the first one to describe SCLC patients (as well\nas those with other cancers) when low titres of\nRAbs have been revealed in the patients\u2019 serum\nwithout any evidence of visual dysfunction in\n\nthem. So far we have found five patients of this\ntype among 50 SCLC patients investigated,\nwhereas sera of the other 45 patients with SCLC\nand of 30 healthy individuals have no RAbs.\nThus, the frequency of the RAbs low titre cases\ncan be preliminary estimated as 10%. It should be\nstressed that this number corresponds to the mea-\nsurements made before the treatment because\nchemotherapy causes disappearance of RAbs\nfrom the blood stream (see Table 1) presumably\ndue to repression of the patients\u2019 immune activity.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are indebted to Professor G.I.
