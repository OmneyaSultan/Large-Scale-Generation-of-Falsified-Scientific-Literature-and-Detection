Electroacupuncture (EA), which derives from traditional Chinesemedicine,may be effective as a complementary\nand alternative method for promoting recovery of neurological function and quality of life. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were\nrandomly divided into 3 groups: (1) sham, (2) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model groups of 2 h MCAO followed\nby 1, 3, 5, or 7 d of reperfusion, and (3) EA groups of 2 h MCAO followed by 1, 3, 5, or 7 d of reperfusion. EA groups received\nEA therapy by needling at GV20 and left ST36. The results show that EA therapy improved the neurological function and reduced\ninfarct volume, confirmed bymodified neurological severity scores and TTC staining. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and\nwestern blot assay verified that EA upregulated the expression of tight junction (TJ) claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occluding-1\nfrom 1 to 7 d after reperfusion. Our findings suggest that EA reduces brain damage and related behavioral deficits via upregulation\nof the TJ proteins.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nStrokes are either ischemic or hemorrhagic, with more than\n80% of stroke cases caused by cerebral ischemia [1]. Although\nmany advances have been made in the treatment of stroke,\ncurrent therapies are lacking in effectiveness. There is a\nsignificant unmet need for developing novel and rational\nstrategies aimed at reducing nervous system impairments\ncaused by cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI). Elec-\ntroacupuncture (EA) was derived 2,500 years ago in ancient\nChina and has been an alternative therapy complement-\ning conventional medicine for stroke. Our previous studies\ndemonstrated that EA at Baihui (GV20) and Zusanli (ST36)\nin rats after CIRI improves the neurological score and reduces\nthe expression of MMP-9 and the inflammatory reaction in\nbrains of rats [2, 3]. EA has recently been shown to accelerate\nrehabilitation of patients with brain ischemia. However, the\npotential mechanism is not fully understood; more evidence\nis needed before EA treatment is accepted clinically.\n\nReperfusion is necessary to restore blood flow and reduce\nneuronal damage caused by ischemia. However, brain dam-\nage even became worse after the blood flow is restored\n[4, 5]. The development of safe and effective agents to\nalleviate cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury will certainly\nimprove the prognosis of ischemic stroke. Many pathological\nmechanisms, like inflammation, increase reactive oxygen\nspecies and brain edema, leading to blood-brain barrier\n(BBB) destruction. Postischemic reperfusion causes edema\nformation by targeting cerebral capillary endothelial cells,\nan important component of neuronal microenvironment\ncalled the neurovascular unit (NVU). Other components\ninclude astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and extracellular\nmatrix around the vessels [6]. These components together\nform the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that protects the brain\nfrom potentially toxic substances and regulates the passage\nof circulating molecules according to size and physical-\nchemical characteristics [7]. Tight junctions (TJs) are located\nbetween adjacent endothelial cells of the BBB and function\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nVolume 2014, Article ID 989340, 10 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/989340\n\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nas gates for molecular transportation through paracellular\nclefts [8]. TJ is a complex network of proteins including the\ntransmembrane proteins occludins, claudins, and peripheral\nmembrane protein family of zonula occludins (ZOs) and\nother molecules. TJs respond to cellular stimuli dynamically\nvia disassembly, redistribution, degradation, and remodeling\ntomaintain the structural and functional integrity of the BBB\n[9, 10]. ZO-1 acts as a crucial central regulator of the structural\norganization of the TJ. It is expressed around the vessels,\nespecially at sites of endothelial cell-cell contact, suggesting\nthat ZO-1 preserves the integrity of the BBB [11]. In fact,\na decrease in ZO-1 increases brain edema [12]. Claudin-5\nand occludin are localized at the leading edge of the brain\nmicrovascular cells and are the major protein components of\nthe transmembrane. TJs act as significant roles in regulating\nthe permeability of BBB [8, 13]. Studies show changes in ZO-\n1 and occludin expression which are consistent with BBB\npermeability changes and are related to BBB opening [14,\n15]. Decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of ZO-\n1, claudin-5, and occludin are closely associated with BBB\nbreakdown and edema in the ischemic brain [16] and also the\nneuroprotective effects of chemical agents against ischemic\ninjury through the prevention of TJ protein downregulation\n[17].\n\nIn the present study, we evaluated how EA at GV20\nand ST36 changed infarct volumes, neurological deficits, and\nexpression levels of TJ-associated proteins ZO-1, claudin-5,\nand occludin following cerebral ischemia reperfusion within\n7 d in Sprague-Dawley rats.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Animals. Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (\ud835\udc5b =\n90) weighing 230\u2013250 g (Peking Union Medical College\nHospital, Beijing, China) were housed in an environmentally\ncontrolled room at 22 \u00b1 2\u2218C, with a 12 h/12 h light/dark\ncycle, and the rats were allowed free access to food and\nwater throughout the whole study. The study was approved\nby the Ethics Committees of Peking Union Medical College\nHospital and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences for the\nCare and Use of Laboratory Animals, and we made all efforts\nto minimize the animal suffering in the study.\n\n2.2. Rat Model of Cerebral Ischemia Reperfusion. Focal cere-\nbral ischemia was established in the rats based on the\nmethods described by Longa et al. [18]. Briefly, rats were anes-\nthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (100 g/0.3mL, intraperi-\ntoneal injection). The right common carotid artery (CCA),\nexternal carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery\n(ICA) were exposed. A 4\u20130 suture (diameter 0.26mm) with\na blunted tip coated with poly-L-lysine was gently advanced\ninto the ICA through the ECA. The suture was advanced\n18\u201320mm (reaching the origin of the right middle cerebral\nartery) beyond the carotid artery bifurcation. To allow the\nreperfusion, the suture was slowly withdrawn after 2 h of\nmiddle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).\n\n2.3. Grouping and Treatment. Rats were randomly divided\ninto the following 3 groups: (1) sham, (2) middle cerebral\n\nartery occlusion (MCAO) model group of 2 h MCAO fol-\nlowed by 1, 3, 5, or 7 d of reperfusion, and (3) EA groups of\n2 hMCAO followed by 1, 3, 5, or 7 d of reperfusion.The sham\ngroup rats received all surgical procedures, but the suture was\nnot advanced into the ICA. No treatments were conducted in\nthe sham and the MCAOmodel groups.\n\nRats in the EA groups received the first EA treatment after\nthe withdrawal of the suture after 2 h of MCAO and then\nreceived EA treatment 20min session once daily. GV20 is\nlocated on the top of the head at the intersection of themiddle\nsagittal line and the connection of two ear apexes. ST36 is\nlocated 3 individual cun below genu and one fingerbreadth\nbefore the anterior crest of the tibia. The rats in the EA\ngroups were needled at GV20 and ST36 with disposable,\nsterile acupuncture needles. Two electrodes (Changzhou\nWujin Great Wall Medical Instrument Co., Ltd., China) were\nattached for acupuncture and continuous-wave stimulation\nat a frequency of 2Hz (intensity 1mA) for 20min. The 20-\nminute session once daily EA regiment for the intervention\ngroup was chosen based on our previously described reports\n[2, 19] and from stroke patients in clinical practice [20].\n\n2.4. Neurological Functional Evaluation. We evaluated neu-\nrological function in the rats (\ud835\udc5b = 9) at 1, 3, 5, and\n7 d postreperfusion using the modified neurological severity\nscores (mNSS) [21] by an observer with no prior knowledge\nof the groups and treatments. The mNSS was composed of\nmotor, sensory, balance beam test, and reflex tests and graded\nfrom0 to 18. AhighermNSS score correlateswithmore severe\ninjury (Table 1).\n\n2.5. Infarct Volume Assessment. Rats (\ud835\udc5b = 3) were narco-\ntized by an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate\n(100 g/0.3mL) and sacrificed by decapitation 7 d after reper-\nfusion to evaluate the volume of cerebral infarction. Brains\nwere quickly removed and chilled in \u221220\u2218C refrigerator for\n10min, and five 2mm consecutive coronal slices were made\nbeginning from the anterior pole. The slices were put into\na solution of 0.1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC;\nSigma, USA) in PBS for 30min at 37\u2218C in darkness before\nbeing transferred into 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. The\ninfarct region appeared white, and the normal tissue was red.\nTo account for edema and differential shrinkage resulting\nfrom tissue processing, the percentage of infarct volume was\ncalculated as follows: [(VC\u2212VL)/VC] \u00d7100%; VC represents\nthe volume of the control hemisphere, and VL is the volume\nof the noninfarct tissue in the lesion hemisphere [22]. The\nsections were photographed and infarct size measured using\nimage analysis software (ImageJ, NIH) by an observer with\nno prior knowledge of the experiment.\n\n2.6. Immunohistochemistry. We used immunohistochemi-\ncal staining to detect distribution and expression of ZO-\n1, claudin-5, and occludin in rats after cerebral ischemia\nreperfusion. At 1, 3, 5, and 7 d post-MCAO reperfusion, rats\n(\ud835\udc5b = 6) were narcotized and perfused transcardially with\n250mL of saline followed by 250mL of 4%paraformaldehyde\nsolution. Brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformalde-\nhyde solution at 4\u2218C for 72 h and then dehydrated and\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\nTable 1: Description of the mNSS [21].\n\nPoints\nMotor tests\n\nRaising the tail of rat 3\n1 forelimb flexion\n1 hindlimb flexion\n1 head moved >10\u2218 to vertical axis within 30 s\n\nPlacing rat on floor 3\n0 walking normally\n1 unable to walk straight\n2 circling toward paretic side\n3 falling down to paretic side\n\nSensory tests 2\n1 placing test\n2 proprioceptive test\n\nBeam balance tests 6\n0 balance with steady posture\n1 grasp the side of beam\n2 hug beam with 1 limb falls down from beam\n3 on the basis of 2, but 2 limbs fall down from beam (>60 s)\n4 attempt to balance on beam but falls off (>40 s)\n5 on the basis of 4, but (>20 s)\n6 drop from the beam or with no action (<20 s)\n\nReflex absence and abnormal movements 4\n1 pinna reflex\n1 corneal reflex\n1 startle reflex\n1 seizures, myoclonus, and myodystony\n\nMaximum 18\n\nembedded in paraffin blocks. Coronal sections at the level\nof optic chiasma in the infarct region were cut into 3 \ud835\udf07m\nthick pieces. Briefly, brain sections were deparaffinized and\nhydrated with decreasing concentrations of alcohol and then\nincubated for 15min in 1% Triton X-100 to disrupt the cell\nmembrane. The sections were incubated with 3% H\n\n2\nO\n2\n\nand 5% normal goat serum at room temperature for 30min\neach. Brain sections were incubated overnight at 4\u2218C with\nrabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 antibody (diluted 1 : 150; Zymed,\nUSA), goat polyclonal anti-claudin-5 antibody (diluted 1 : 50;\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology, USA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-\noccludin antibody (diluted 1 : 150; Abcam, UK) and then the\nremaining procedures accorded with the standard proce-\ndures. Brain sections were photographed (Leica DM4000,\nGermany) and analyzed using image analysis software (Image\nJ, NIH) for semiquantitative tests of MMP-2, AQP4, and\nAQP9 integrated optical density (IOD).\n\n2.7. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Anal-\nyses (qPCR). Expression levels of mRNA for ZO-1, claudin-\n5, and occludin in the rats (\ud835\udc5b = 3) were determined by\nqPCR. Total RNAs were extracted from the ischemic hemi-\nsphere using the RNeasy mini kit (Omega, USA) and\nreverse transcribed to cDNA. The reverse transcription (RT)\nreaction was amplified on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Detection\nSystem (Applied Biosystems, USA) using the Plexor One-\nStep qRT-PCR System (Promega A4021, USA). For ZO-1,\n\nclaudin-5, and occludin, the following primers were used:\nZO-1 forward: 5\udba0\udc20-GATGAGCGGGCTACCTTATTGA-3\udba0\udc20,\nreverse 5\udba0\udc20-TTGGTCGGGAGATCGTGACTG-3\udba0\udc20; claudin-\n5 forward: 5\udba0\udc20-GGTGAGCATTCGGTCTTTAGC-3\udba0\udc20, reverse\n5\udba0\udc20-TTGTGGTCCAGGAAGGCAGT-3\udba0\udc20; occludin forward:\n5\udba0\udc20-TGGGACAGAGCCTATGGAACG-3\udba0\udc20, reverse 5\udba0\udc20-TTG-\nGTCGGGAGATCGTGACTG-3\udba0\udc20.The fold change of relative\nmRNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct [23]\nmethod and using GADPH as an endogenous reference:\nGADPH forward: 5\udba0\udc20-CACAGCAAGTTCAACGGCACAG-\n3\udba0\udc20, reverse 5\udba0\udc20-GACGCCAGTAGACTCCACGACA-3.\n\n2.8. Western Blot Analysis. The ischemic hemispheres of the\nrats (\ud835\udc5b = 3) were homogenized in Radio-Immunoprecipita-\ntion Assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology,\nChina); proteins were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 g\nfor 15min at 4\u2218C. Supernatants were harvested and the\nprotein concentration of each sample was determined by\nbicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Beyotime Biotechnology,\nChina). For gel electrophoresis, samples were separated\non 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels; separated proteins were\nelectrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mem-\nbranes (Millipore, USA). Membranes were blocked for 2 h\nwith 5% nonfat milk (BD, USA) at room temperature and\nthen were incubated overnight at 4\u2218C with primary antibod-\nies: rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 antibodies (diluted 1 : 500;\nZymed, USA), goat polyclonal anti-claudin-5 antibodies\n\n\n\n4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\n(diluted 1 : 200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), and rabbit\npolyclonal anti-occludin antibodies (diluted 1 : 300; Abcam,\nUK).After threewashes,membraneswere incubated for 2 h at\nroom temperature with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody\n(1 : 5000; Jackson, USA). Detection was performed using an\nECL kit (Millipore, USA). Blots were subsequently probed\nfor \ud835\udefd-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) as an internal\ncontrol for normalization of protein loading. The intensities\nof the bands were measured using image analysis software\n(Labworks 4.6, China).\n\n2.9. Statistical Analysis. All data were analyzed with the\nstatistical analysis software SPSS (Statistical Package for the\nSocial Sciences) 17.0 and are presented as themean\u00b1 standard\ndeviation (SD). Differences among multiple groups were\nanalyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by LSD t-test.\nStatistical significance was assumed in all cases if \ud835\udc43 < 0.05.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. EA Improved the Neurological Function in Focal Cerebral\nIschemia Rats. We performed a neurological functional test\nto determine whether acupuncture treatment of CIRI rats\nregulates functional outcome.We assessed neurological func-\ntion of the rats at 1, 3, 5, and 7 d after reperfusion using\nthe mNSS. Rats receiving EA treatment showed significant\nimprovement in neurological function compared to the\nMCAO model groups at the same time points (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05,\n\ud835\udc5b = 9) (Figure 1).\n\n3.2. EA Reduced Infarct Volume in Focal Cerebral Ischemia\nRats. TTC assay results show that the infarct regions\nremained white while the normal brain tissues were red\n(Figure 2). In the ischemic hemisphere, the cerebral infarc-\ntion areas included frontoparietal cortex, temporal cortex,\nand lateral portion of neostriatum. EA treatment significantly\ndecreased the volume of infarct regions at days 1 and 7\ncompared with untreated animals (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05, \ud835\udc5b = 3, Figure 3).\nThese results support the neuroprotective effect of EA treat-\nment against cerebral ischemic injury.\n\n3.3. EA Changed the Distribution and Expression of mRNA\nand Protein of Tight-Junction Proteins ZO-1, Claudin-5, and\nOccludin in Focal Cerebral Ischemia Rats. We explored\nwhether EA treatment maintains the BBB permeability via\nmodulation of TJ proteins. We evaluated the distribution\nof ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin by immunohistochemical\nstaining, gene expression by qPCR, and protein expression\nwestern blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry staining results\nrevealed that the expressions of ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin\nwere localized continuously on the cerebral microvessels\nin the sham group. In contrast, the expression of ZO-\n1, claudin-5, and occludin in the cerebral vascular struc-\ntures in both MCAO and EA groups following reperfusion\nshowed discontinuous staining and significant disruptions.\nExpression of ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin decreased at\ndays 1 to 5 d and then increased at day 7.

Results show protein levels of ZO-1,\nclaudin-5, and occludin in ischemic cerebral areawere consis-\ntent with findings obtained from the immunohistochemical\nstaining and qPCR (Figure 5). The protein expression levels\nof ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin were significantly improved\nin the EA groups as compared with the MCAO groups at 1, 3,\n5, and 7 d (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05, Figure 6). These data show EA therapy\nwas effective on CIRI.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn this study, we provide evidence showing EA at GV20\nand ST36 in rats after CIRI reduced the ischemic brain\ndamage in models of focal cerebral ischemia within 7 d\nof reperfusion. EA therapy was proved to reduce infarct\nvolume and improve neurological functional outcome in\nacute ischemic stroke rats. We show that EA promotes\nBBB tightness by alleviating the disruption of the TJ-related\nproteins ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin during the process of\ncerebral ischemia reperfusion. We argue that EA ameliorates\nfocal cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury via modulation of\nTJ protein expression. Our findings suggest that EA should\nbe considered complementary and alternative medicine for\nalleviating cerebral ischemia.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5\n\nSham MCAO\n\nafter 2hr MCAO\n7d postreperfusion\n\nEA\n\nafter 2 hr MCAO\n7d postreperfusion\n\nFigure 2: TTC staining of brain slices.

Clinically, ischemia reperfusion injury\nhas become a challenge in ischemic cerebrovascular disease.\nMany pathological mechanisms are associated with reper-\nfusion injury including inflammation, increase in reactive\n\noxygen species, brain edema, BBB destruction, necrosis, and\napoptosis.\n\nThe BBB consists of brain microvascular endothelial\ncells and astroglial cell end-feet that protect the brain from\npotentially toxic substances. It also regulates the passage\nof circulating molecules on the basis of size and physical-\nchemical characteristics. BBB disruption and brain edema\nformation both act important roles in the development\nof neurological dysfunction in acute and chronic cerebral\nischemia. The structural and functional integrity of the\nBBB is maintained by interendothelial cell TJs. The BBB is\nconstructed of TJs, including occludin and claudin-5, which\nform the endothelial barrier. TJs are a complex network\nof proteins and consisted of the transmembrane proteins\n(occludins, claudins, and junctional adhesionmolecules) and\nperipheral membrane protein family of ZOs (ZO-1, ZO-2,\nandZO-3). At themolecular level, the proteins ZO-1, claudin-\n5, and occludin are highly enriched at the TJ [8]. The TJs\nrestrict the paracellular movement of solutes (water soluble\nand polar compounds) and small ions. ZO-1 is expressed\naround the vessels, especially at sites of endothelial cell-\ncell contact. ZO-1 acts as a crucial central regulator of the\nstructural organization of the TJ and preserves the integrity\nof the BBB [11]. In fact, a decrease in ZO-1 coincides with\nan increase in cerebral edema [12]. The claudin family,\nspecifically claudin-5, which is localized at the leading edge of\nbrain microvascular cells, is important intercellular junction\nproteins and essential for the modulation of endothelial\npermeability. Previous reports prove that downregulation of\nclaudin-5 is closely related to cerebral ischemia [8, 13, 24]. TJ\nprotein occludin is critically involved in sealing the TJ [25],\nand its disruption alone is enough to cause functional changes\nof the TJ [26]. It also has been demonstrated that occludin\nis significantly reduced in CIRI rats [27]. Some chemical\nagents are neuroprotective against ischemic injury via the\nprevention of TJ protein downregulation [17]. Decreased\nexpression of ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin mRNA and\nprotein is associated with BBB breakdown and edema in the\nischemic brain [14, 16].\n\nTJ protein downregulation, translocation, or phospho-\nrylation is closely related with the BBB breakdown in focal\ncerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. However, there is lim-\nited data describing the relationship between TJ protein\nand recovery of ischemic stroke. Growing research on other\ncentral nervous system diseases, like multiple sclerosis, brain\ntumors, Parkinson\u2019s, and Alzheimer\u2019s, suggests that disrup-\ntion of TJ integrity is associated with BBB dysfunctions.\nVarious molecular mechanisms including downregulation,\nphosphorylation, degradation, or translocation of TJ proteins\nmay work in the pathological process of these diseases [28\u2013\n32].\n\nWe are in need of effective neuroprotective methods and\nrational strategies aimed at preventing CIRI and reducing\nimpairments caused by it. Acupuncture is one of the major\ncomplementary and alternative therapies for stroke, and it\nhas gained public support. According to traditional Chinese\nmedicine, the body is an interconnected and self-contained\nsystem, relying on many factors to maintain a balanced and\nhealthy state. Qi, blood, ying, and yang are vital matters\n\n\n\n6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nZO-1\nSham M1 M3 M5 M7 E1 E3 E5 E7\n\nOccludin\n\nClaudin-5\n\n(a)\n\nIn\nte\n\ngr\nat\n\ned\n o\n\npt\nic\n\nal\n d\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n o\n\nf\nZO\n\n-1\n\nSham\nMCAO\nEA\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\nSham\n\n\u0394\u22c6 \u0394\u22c6\n\u0394\u22c6\n\n\u0394\u22c6\n\n1d 3d 5d 7d\n\n(b)\n\nIn\nte\n\ngr\nat\n\ned\n o\n\npt\nic\n\nal\n d\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n o\n\nf\ncl\n\nau\ndi\n\nn-\n5\n\nSham\nMCAO\nEA\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\nSham\n\n\u0394\u22c6\n\u0394\u22c6\n\n\u0394\u22c6 \u0394\u22c6\n\n1d 3d 5d 7d\n\n(c)\n\nIn\nte\n\ngr\nat\n\ned\n o\n\npt\nic\n\nal\n d\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n o\n\nf\noc\n\ncl\nud\n\nin\n\nSham\nMCAO\nEA\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394 \u2217\u0394\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\nSham\n\n\u0394\u22c6 \u0394\u22c6\n\n\u0394\u22c6 \u0394\u22c6\n\n1d 3d 5d 7d\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 4: Effects of EA on the distribution and expression of ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin on ischemic cerebral microvessels.

Qi flows in a system of meridians\nand functions to warm the body and protect it from illness.\nBlood and qi are closely related. Blood nourishes the qi\nand offers a material foundation keeping qi in the correct\nlocation. Blood contains the spirit, which is significant for\nthe mental state. Yin and yang are two opposite sides of\nthe substance in traditional Chinese, and they will not exist\nwithout each other. When yin and yang are functioning\nharmoniously they maintain a dynamic balance, with no\nclinical symptoms. However, in pathological conditions, the\nbalance is interrupted.\n\nGV20 belongs to the governor vessel, which may connect\nall yang vessels in the whole body. GV20 functions to regulate\n\nlocal qi and blood and modulates the balance between yin\nand yang. After being stimulated, GV20 makes the normal\nfunction of the body active, dispersing local yang. ST36\nbelongs to the stomach meridian, which is rich in both qi\nand blood. Thus, it is supposed as an acupoint for its role\nin the recovery of paralysis. The combined use of the two\nacupoints is effective in dredging the channels and collaterals,\nmodifying the blood and qi and balancing yin and yang.\nEA therapy developed from traditional acupuncture, and\ncompared with traditional acupuncture EA adds electrical\nstimulation to acupoints. Many researches focus on the\nmechanism of neuroprotective effect of the EA therapy.\nMany studies have certified that EA improves neurological\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7\n\n1d 3d 5d 7d\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\nR\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nm\nR\n\nN\nA\n\n le\nve\n\nls\n o\n\nf Z\nO\n\n-1\n\nSham\nMCAO\nEA\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\nSham\n\n\u0394\u22c6\n\u0394\u22c6\n\n\u0394\u22c6\n\u0394\u22c6\n\n(a)\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nm\n\nR\nN\n\nA\n le\n\nve\nls\n\n o\nf c\n\nla\nud\n\nin\n-5\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nSham\nMCAO\nEA\n\n\u0394 \u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\nSham\n\n\u0394 \u0394\n\n1d 3d 5d 7d\n\n(b)\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nm\n\nR\nN\n\nA\n le\n\nve\nls\n\n o\nf o\n\ncc\nlu\n\ndi\nn\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nSham\nMCAO\nEA\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\nSham\n\n\u0394\u22c6\n\u0394\u22c6\n\n\u0394\u22c6\n\u0394\u22c6\n\n1d 3d 5d 7d\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 5: mRNA expression of ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin analyzed by qPCR after EA.
