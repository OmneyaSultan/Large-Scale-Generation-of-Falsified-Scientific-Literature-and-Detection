Franklin\n\n1\n& Vernonica E. Franklin-Tong\n\n1\n\nHigher plants produce seed through pollination, using specific\ninteractions between pollen and pistil. Self-incompatibility is an\nimportantmechanismused inmany species to prevent inbreeding;\nit is controlled by a multi-allelic S locus1,2. \u2018Self\u2019 (incompatible)\npollen is discriminated from \u2018non-self\u2019 (compatible) pollen by\ninteraction of pollen and pistil S locus components, and is subse-\nquently inhibited. In Papaver rhoeas, the pistil S locus product is a\nsmall protein that interacts with incompatible pollen, triggering a\nCa21-dependent signalling network, resulting in pollen inhibition\nand programmed cell death3\u20137. Here we have cloned three alleles of\na highly polymorphic pollen-expressed gene,PrpS (Papaver rhoeas\npollen S), from Papaver and provide evidence that this encodes the\npollen S locus determinant.PrpS is a single-copy gene linked to the\npistil S gene (currently called S, but referred to hereafter asPrsS for\nPapaver rhoeas stigma Sdeterminant). Sequence analysis indicates\nthat PrsS and PrpS are equally ancient and probably co-evolved.\nPrpS encodes a novel 20-kDa protein. Consistent with predic-\ntions that it is a transmembrane protein, PrpS is associated with\nthe plasma membrane. We show that a predicted extracellular\nloop segment of PrpS interacts with PrsS and, usingPrpS antisense\noligonucleotides, we demonstrate that PrpS is involved in\nS-specific inhibition of incompatible pollen. Identification of\nPrpS represents a major advance in our understanding of the\nPapaver self-incompatibility system. As a novel cell\u2013cell recog-\nnition determinant it contributes to the available information\nconcerning the origins and evolution of cell\u2013cell recognition\nsystems involved in discrimination between self and non-self,\nwhich also include histocompatibility systems in primitive chor-\ndates and vertebrates.\n\nIt has been established that self-incompatibility has evolved inde-\npendently several times. Three self-incompatibility systems have been\nwell characterized at a molecular level1,2. Both pollen and pistil\nSdeterminants are expected to have co-evolved and bephysically linked\nto the S locus in order to maintain a functional self-incompatibility\nsystem. Other characteristics expected of them are high levels of\nallelic polymorphism and tissue-specific expression.Most importantly,\nthey should function inmediating the self-incompatibility response. To\nunderstand fully how different self-incompatibility systems operate,\nidentification of both the pistil and pollen S locus components,\ntogether with establishing mechanisms involved in pollen inhibition,\nis crucial. Previously, we identified the pistil S determinant for Papaver\nrhoeas8\u201310 and established several components involved in pollen\ninhibition3\u20137,11. Although we identified a glycoprotein in pollen that\nbound to the pistil S protein, studies indicated that it was not the pollen\nS determinant, although it might modulate the self-incompatibility\nresponse12. Recent analysis of the S1 locus enabled identification of\n\nthe pollen component of the S locus on a cosmid clone comprising a\n42-kilobase (kb) region at the S1 locus.\n\nNucleotide sequencing and analysis identified a novel putative\nopen reading frame (ORF) 457 base pairs (bp) from the S1 pistil gene\n(Fig. 1a). Expression analysis using polymerase chain reaction with\nreverse transcription (RT\u2013PCR) revealed that the ORF was specifi-\ncally transcribed in pollen (Fig. 1b), appearing during anther\ndevelopment (Fig. 1c). The temporal expression pattern is very\nsimilar to that of the pistil S gene8. These data suggested that this\nORF was a candidate for the Papaver pollen S gene (designated PrpS\nfor Papaver rhoeas pollen S). We propose renaming the gene that\ndetermines self-incompatibility specificity in pistils (currently desig-\nnated as S) to provide a clearer nomenclature; we suggest PrsS\n(Papaver rhoeas stigma S determinant).\n\nThe cDNA of PrpS1 comprises 1,206 bp containing a coding region\nof 579 bp encoding a 192-amino-acid polypeptide with a predicted\nmolecular mass of 20.5 kDa, pI 7.55. We subsequently cloned PrpS3\nand PrpS8 from S3S8 pollen RNA. The PrpS3 and PrpS8 coding\nsequences are 576 bp and 582 bp (191 and 193 amino acids), respec-\ntively (Fig. 1d); PrpS3 and PrpS8 encode proteins of predicted\nmolecular mass of 21.1 kDa (pI 6.57) and 20.9 kDa (pI 8.51), respec-\ntively. Southern blotting revealed that PrpS is a single-copy gene\n(Supplementary Fig. 1), so the related sequences identified as PrpS3\nand PrpS8 are clearly allelic to PrpS1, rather than being related/para-\nlogous genes.\n\nSegregation analyses were conducted to obtain evidence of genetic\nlinkage at the S locus between PrsS3 and PrpS3 and between PrsS8 and\nPrpS8. Specific primers were used to amplify regions of the pistil\nPrsS1, PrsS3 and PrsS8 and pollen PrpS1, PrpS3 and PrpS8 genes from\ngenomic DNA from two full-sibling families segregating for these\nhaplotypes (45 and 25 individuals, a total of 140 PrpS/PrsS pairs).\nPrpS1was amplified only fromplants carrying the S1 haplotype; PrpS3\nwas amplified only from plants carrying the S3 haplotype; and PrpS8\nwas amplified only from plants carrying the S8 haplotype. The pistil\nPrsS1, PrsS3 and PrsS8 sequences were also amplified only from plants\ncarrying the respective S haplotypes (Fig. 1e), as expected. This\ndemonstrates co-segregation and linkage of PrpS1, PrpS3 and PrpS8\nand their cognate PrsS genes, as no recombination was detected\n(recombination frequency,0.021). Thus, at the 95% rejection level\nwe can be confident that there is no recombination.\n\nA markedly high level of allelic sequence polymorphism is a well-\ndocumented feature of S locus proteins; S alleles have unusually high\namino acid sequence divergence within species13\u201316. Papaver is no\nexception, with the pistil proteins PrsS1 and PrsS3 showing 46%\nsequence divergence, PrsS1 and PrsS8 showing 40% divergence, and\nPrsS3 and PrsS8 with 46% divergence. PrpS proteins have a similar\n\n1\nSchool of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. {Present addresses: Warwick HRI,Wellesbourne,Warwick CV35 9EF, UK (M.J.W.); School of\nBiosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3AT, UK (B.H.J.d.G.).\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\n\nVol 459 | 18 June 2009 |doi:10.1038/nature08027\n\n992\n Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Examination of the PrpS sequences for non-synonymous\nto synonymous (Ka/Ks) substitutions reveal that the PrsS alleles have\na mean Ka/Ks ratio of 0.234, and the PrpS alleles have a mean Ka/Ks\nratio of 0.368 (Supplementary Table 1). A two-tailed t-test showed no\nsignificant difference between substitution rates in PrpS and PrsS\ngenes. These data indicate that the pollen and pistil S alleles co-\nevolved and are likely to be similarly ancient.\n\nPrpS has no significant sequence homology to any protein in exist-\ning databases. Sequence analysis, using a range of prediction programs,\n\nindicated that PrpS has 3\u20135 predicted transmembrane helices, and\nalignment of the three PrpS alleles indicates that they share a similar\ntopology (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2). In support of predictions\nthat PrpS is a transmembrane protein, western blot analysis using\nantisera raised against PrpS1 revealed that PrpS1 was detected as a\n,20-kDaprotein specifically inS1pollen-membrane-enriched extracts\n(Fig. 2a\u2013c).Moreover, immunolocalization studies revealed that PrpS1\nis associated with the pollen tube plasma membrane (Fig. 2d).\nAlthough the PrpS sequences do not show any particular bias for the\n\u2018positive inside rule\u201917, structural predictions suggest an extracellular\nloop segment, comprising amino acids ,60\u2013100 (63\u201397 using\nTMHMM, Fig. 1d; see also Supplementary Fig. 2). We hypothesized\nthat this region might be involved in the interaction with PrsS and\nshow that a peptide corresponding to part of the predicted PrpS extra-\ncellular loop interacted with the PrsS protein, whereas the correspond-\ning randomized peptide did not (Fig. 2e).\n\nTo determine whether PrpS is functionally involved in the self-\nincompatibility response, we investigated whether it mediates\nS-specific pollen inhibition, using in vitro self-incompatibility bio-\nassays8. Peptides based on extracellular domains of receptors have\nbeen used to identify ligand-binding epitopes via their ability to block\nthe receptor\u2013ligand interaction18. Preliminary experiments with the\npeptide used in the binding assay tested whether it could block self-\nincompatibility-mediated inhibition. Pollen from plants with haplo-\ntypes S1S3, when challenged with incompatible recombinant PrsS,\nwere rescued from inhibition by PrpS1 peptides (n5 6; P, 0.001;\nSupplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2) whereas rando-\nmized peptides based on the same amino acids had no effect (n5 6;\nnot significant, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2).\nThis is consistent with the hypothesis that this region is involved in\nrecognition and indicated that PrpS might mediate pollen inhibition.\nTo confirm this possibility, we used an antisense oligonucleotide\napproach3,19. We hypothesized that if PrpS functions as the pollen S\ndeterminant, knockdown of its expression should result in alleviation\nof pollen tube inhibition in an S-specific manner. We induced self-\nincompatibility in vitro in the presence of either antisense (as-ODNs)\nor sense (s-ODNs) oligonucleotides to test this hypothesis.

With pollen from plants with S1S3\nhaplotypes, self-incompatibility induced strong inhibition of pollen\ntube length (22.1%, P, 0.001, n5 300); addition of PrpS1 as-ODNs\ngave a highly significant recovery of self-incompatibility-treated\ntubes (58.3% increase in length compared to self-incompatibility-\ntreated; P, 0.001, n5 150), and incompatible pollen responded in\na bimodal manner, consistent with only S1 pollen being affected\n(Supplementary Fig. 4). When PrpS8 as-ODNs were added to the\nsame pollen from plants with S1S3 haplotypes, they did not alleviate\nself-incompatibility-induced inhibition (P5 0.604, not significant,\nn5 150). This demonstrates that the PrpS1 and PrpS8 as-ODNs had\nan S-specific effect. As expected, PrpS1 s-ODNs did not affect the self-\nincompatibility response (P5 0.591, not significant, n5 150).\n\nTo confirm further the S-specific effect of the as-ODNs, we also\ntested their effect on pollen from plants with haplotypes S3S8. Self-\nincompatibility resulted in inhibited pollen tubes (19.8% of the con-\ntrol, n5 300), and addition of PrpS8 as-ODNs alleviated the self-\nincompatibility-induced inhibition, giving a highly significant\n100.3% increase in pollen tube length (P, 0.001, n5 150), whereas\nthere was no effect using PrpS1 as-ODNs (P5 0.336, not significant,\nn5 150) or PrpS8 s-ODNs (P5 0.565, not significant, n5 150)\n(Fig. 3). Together these data demonstrate that PrpS has a crucial role\nin self-incompatibility-induced S-haplotype-specific pollen tube\ninhibition.\n\nWe have cloned a polymorphic pollen-expressed gene, PrpS.\nTogether our data are consistent with the hypothesis that PrpS is\n\nthe Papaver pollen S determinant as it mediates S-specific recognition\nand inhibition. Self-incompatibility in Papaver is distinct from the\nother well characterized self-incompatibility systems (that is, from\nboth the Brassica pollen S determinant SCR/SP11 and the pollen\nF-box protein SLF/SFB from the S-RNase-based self-incompatibility\nsystem)1,20\u201323. As PrpS has no homologues, its nature is intriguing.\nSelf/non-self discrimination and other recognition systems which\nare controlled by a highly polymorphic locus are not limited to self-\nincompatibility; other systems include disease resistance in plants24\n\nand histocompatibility systems in animals25\u201327. These parallels\nbetween non-analogous recognition systems were recognized, and\ntheir importance appreciated, long before themolecular basis of these\nsystems were elucidated25 and the nature of their polymorphism has\nintrigued population and evolutionary biologists for decades. The\nidentification of PrpS as a novel cell\u2013cell recognition determinant thus\ncontributes to the available information regarding the evolution of\nself/non-self recognition systems.\n\nMETHODS SUMMARY\nCloning of PrpS1, PrpS3 and PrpS8. A genomic clone of PrpS1 was identified by\nnucleotide sequence analysis of a 42-kb clone carrying the S1 locus, obtained by\n\nscreening a P. rhoeas S1S3 cosmid genomic DNA library (SuperCos1, Stratagene)\n\nwith PrsS1 cDNA. The DNA upstream and downstream of the PrsS1 gene was\n\nsequenced and analysed using BLAST (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) and\n\nORF Finder (http://searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu)28. The organization of PrpS1\nand PrsS1 genes was confirmed using PCR on genomic DNA of S1- and non-S1-\n\ncontaining plants. PrpS3 and PrpS8 cDNAs were obtained using RT\u2013PCR, 39 and\n\n59-RACE PCR (see Methods for primer details) on pollen cDNA from suitable\n\nS-haplotypes, using low annealing temperatures (48 uC).\nKa/Ks calculations. DNAsP\n\n29 was used to estimate Ka (the number of non-\n\nsynonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site) and Ks (the number of\n\nsynonymous substitutions per synonymous site) for pairs of PrsS and PrpS\n\nnucleotide sequences.\n\nPeptide binding assay. A 15-amino-acid peptide (DQKWVVAFGTAAICD)\ncorresponding to part of the predicted extracellular loop segment of PrpS1\n(TMHMM; http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM30) and a randomized\n\nversion (FTVDVKDCAAAWGQI) were synthesized (Alta Bioscience). The pep-\n\ntides (10 mg, 1 mg, 0.1mg) were bound to PVDF membrane. This was incubated\nwith recombinant PrsS1 and then probed for binding using anti-PrsS1 antisera\n\nand alkaline phosphatase detection.\n\nAntisense oligonucleotide silencing of PrpS expression. Phosphorothioated\ngene-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (as-ODN) and their sense con-\n\ntrols (s-ODN) were designed (PrpS1 as-ODN, gtccTCCCAGTATTAttga; PrpS1\ns-ODN, tcaaTAATACTGGGAggac; PrpS8 as-ODN, ttccCACCAGCACAGCaatt;\n\nPrpS8 s-ODN, aattGCTGTGCTGGTGggaa; lowercase letters indicate bases\n\nlinked by phosphorothioate bonds). Pollen was grown in vitro and pre-treated\n\nwith as-ODNs and s-ODNs3,19 for 1 h before induction of self-incompatibility\n\nwith recombinant PrsS1, PrsS3 and PrsS8 (ref. 8). After 2 h, pollen tubes were\n\nfixed in 2% formaldehyde and 150 pollen tube lengths were measured in three\n\nindependent experiments.\n\nFull Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of\nthe paper at www.nature.com/nature.\n\nReceived 17 December 2008; accepted 27 March 2009.\nPublished online 31 May 2009.\n\n1.

Sequence identities were calculated for PrsS\nand PrpS, using pairwise comparisons of the amino acids comprising themature\n\npeptide, using BLAST (BLOSUM62)31.\n\nSouthern blotting. Southern blots of Papaver genomic DNA from plants of\ndifferent S-haplotypes (S1S8, S1S3, S3S8, S2S4, S3S4, S7Sx) digested with EcoRV,\n\nBamHI, Pst1 or BglII were probed with a PrpS1 probe. Blots were hybridized at\n\n60 uC overnight and washed down to 30.5 SSC at 50 uC, and signals detected\nusing autoradiography.\n\nStructural predictions for PrpS and interpretation of the data. We analysed\nPrpS sequences using a number of protein prediction programs: TMHMM2.032,\n\nPredictProtein, SOSUI, HMMTOP, TMpred, TM-Finder, SPLIT 4, ConPredII,\n\nPhobius. TMHMM2.0 in particular is regarded as a very robust transmembrane\n\nhelix predictor, although predicting the number of membrane-spanning regions\n\nremains difficult33. Although predictions differ, they all predict that PrpS has\n\ntransmembrane helices. We have been advised that the predictions suggest\n\nanything between 3\u20135 transmembrane segments and the alignment of the PrpS\n\nsequences suggests that all three proteins share a similar topology. Althoughmany\n\npredictions indicated three or five transmembrane domains, it is more likely that\n\nPrpS has four transmembrane segments, as it is a good number to make a four-\n\nhelix bundle in themembrane, as three and five transmembrane proteins are rare\n\n(A. Lovering, personal communication). All the predictions indicate an extracel-\n\nlular loop segment. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows a cartoon indicating predictions\n\nfor the regions; this is a tentative assignment of possible topology.\n\nLinkage analysis. Segregation analysis was carried out on individual plants from\nseveral full-sibling families which share three S haplotypes and segregate for\n\nhaplotypes S1S3 or S3S8 and S1S8 or S3S8. These are well established families, in\n\nwhich S haplotypes were designated ,20 years ago, produced using controlled\ncrosses between individuals which had their S-haplotypes verified using aniline\n\nbluemicroscopy; they have been analysed for S allele segregation for at least seven\n\ngenerations in a pedigree going back to 1994.\n\nThe number of plants required to be analysed, in order to be statistically\n\nconfident at 95% rejection level34 that there is no recombination, is 25 plants\n\n(one cannot formally provide evidence that there is never recombination). We\n\ncarried out analysis of a full-sibling family, segregating for pollenPrpS1 andPrpS3\nand pistil PrsS1 and PrsS3 alleles (25 plants, 50 alleles) and for the S1 and S8 loci,\n\nand analysed 45 full-sibling plants (90 alleles) to show segregation of pollenPrpS1\nand PrpS8 and pistil PrsS1 and PrsS8. Thus, we examined segregation of a total of\n\n140 PrpS/PrsS pairs of alleles. Genomic DNA from leaf tissue was extracted\n\n(Extract-N-Amp Plant PCR kit, Sigma-Aldrich) and gene-specific primers used\n\nto specifically amplify PrsS1, PrsS3 and PrsS8, and PrpS1, PrpS3 and PrpS8\nsequences. (See Supplementary Table 3 for primer details.) No recombination\n\nwas detected (RF, 0.021). Thus, at the 95% rejection level, we can be confident\n\nthat there is no recombination.\n\nRT\u2013PCR to show tissue and developmental specificity. Standard RT\u2013PCR\ntechniqueswereused for expression analysis. TotalRNAwas extracted fromanthers\n\nfrom plants with the S1 haplotype at different stages of development and from\n\ndifferent tissues (RNAeasy plant mini kit, QIAGEN) and cDNA synthesized\n\n(Omniscript RT kit, QIAGEN). Gene-specific primers (see Supplementary Table\n\n3) were used to amplify PrpS1 transcripts; primers for the P. rhoeas glyceraldehyde-\n\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) gene acted as controls.\n\nProduction of antisera. The predicted 60 amino acid carboxy terminus of PrpS1\n(designated PrpS1-60C) was expressed as a His-tagged recombinant protein\n\nusing pET21b (Novagen). Recombinant protein was isolated from Escherichia\n\ncoli BL21 (DE3) using Ni-NTA resin following the manufacturer\u2019s (QIAGEN)\n\nprotocol. Antisera (PrpS1-60C) was raised in rats (ISL Immune Systems).\n\nProtein extraction for SDS\u2013PAGE and western blotting. Extracts enriched for\nmembrane proteins were made in 100mM Tris-HCl pH8, 200mM NaCl, 2mM\n\nEDTA, 1M sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche).\n\nProtein concentrations were determined35 and proteins separated using SDS\u2013\n\nPAGE and electroblotted (400mA, 3 h) onto Hybond C membranes (GE\n\nHealthcare). These were incubated with the PrpS1-60C antibody (1:2,000) for\n\n2 h, followed by alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody\n\n(Sigma); detection used BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-39-indolyphosphate p-toluidine\n\nsalt) and NBT (Nitroblue tetrazolium chloride).\n\nImmunolocalization. Papaver rhoeas pollen from plants with haplotypes S1S3\nwas grown in germinationmedium (GM)36 for 1 h at 25 uC and prepared accord-\ning to themethodof ref. 37, followedby incubationwith the PrpS1-60C antibody\n\n(1:500 in TBS 1 1% BSA; 4 uC overnight), then FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat\nantibody (1:50, 1.5 h). Cells were mounted on slides and examined by confocal\n\nmicroscopy (Bio-RadRadiance 2000MP) using single scans (3100 plan-Apo 1.4\n\nNA oil objective, Nikon). When pre-immune antiserum was used, no signal was\n\nobtained using identical additions and settings.\n\nThe in vitro bioassay for Papaver self-incompatibility: use of this as an assay\nfor function.Wehave used in vitro bioassays for demonstration of PrpS function\ninstead of the alternative strategy of stable transformation with a PrpS allele\n\nbecause the latter is not possible in Papaver. These bioassays have been routinely\n\nused to demonstrate S-specific function. Because it has not been possible to\n\ngenerate plants that are homozygous for S haplotypes in Papaver, we use full-\n\nsibling families that are segregating for plants that are heterozygous for\n\nS haplotypes. This makes the interpretation of the data slightly more compli-\n\ncated, as we always have a mixed population of pollen grains in our samples.\n\nThe Papaver self-incompatibility in vitro bioassay was initially used for dem-\n\nonstrating that stigmatic extracts had S-specific biological activity; we showed the\n\ndistribution of individual pollen tube lengths for control, fully compatible,\n\nincompatible and half-compatible interactions, with bimodal distribution of\n\ninhibition in a half-compatible self-incompatibility response, as expected38.\n\nThis self-incompatibility bioassay was used to provide evidence for the pistil S\n\ngene (for whichwe propose the name PrsS) being the S determinant39; we demon-\n\nstrated S-allele-specific inhibition of pollen by recombinant PrsS1 protein. This\n\nhalf-compatible interaction gave 40\u201344% mean inhibition (compared to the\n\ntheoretical maximum of 50%) with pollen from plants with haplotypes S1S3 or\n\nS1S6, but no inhibitionwith pollen fromplants with haplotypes S3S6or S2S4. Aswe\n\nnow have several cloned pistil PrsS alleles, for any in vitro self-incompatibility\n\nbioassay, we routinely add two recombinant PrsS proteins to obtain a full self-\n\nincompatibility responsewhere all pollen is inhibited (see for example refs 40\u201342).\n\nFor the self-incompatibility in vitro bioassays carried out here, we used two\n\nrecombinant PrsS proteins (PrsS1 and PrsS3 to pollen from plants with haplo-\n\ntypes S1S3, and PrsS3 and PrsS8 proteins to pollen from plants with haplotypes\n\nS3S8) to achieve a full self-incompatibility response (all pollen inhibited).\n\nWith the peptide bioassay (see below) we added the PrpS1 peptide to the self-\n\nincompatibility bioassay, so the expectation was that a maximum of 50% of\n\npollen would be rescued if we obtained S-haplotype-specific alleviation of self-\n\nincompatibility. For the antisense oligonucleotide experiments we used pollen\n\nfrom plants with S1S3 and S3S8 haplotypes in combination with antisense PrpS1\nand/or antisensePrpS8. The expectationwas that S-haplotype-specific alleviation\n\nof self-incompatibility would be obtained using antisense PrpS1with pollen from\n\nplants with S1S3 haplotypes, but this would only rescue 50% (pollen carrying\n\nPrpS1, but not pollen carrying PrpS3); we would also expect no alleviation of self-\n\nincompatibility with antisense PrpS1 with the pollen from S3S8 plants. We also\n\ncarried out experiments with antisense PrpS8 in these combinations, with the\n\nprediction that antisense PrpS8will alleviate the self-incompatibility response by\n\na maximum of 50% with pollen from plants with S3S8 haplotypes (rescue of\n\npollen carrying PrpS8, but not PrpS3). Supplementary Fig. 3 shows data for\n\npopulations of individual pollen tubes for an experiment using a PrpS1 antisense\n\noligonucleotide added to a self-incompatibility assay using pollen from plants\n\nwith S1S3 or S3S8 haplotypes. The expectation is that PrpS1 antisense oligonu-\n\ncleotide should rescue pollen carrying the PrpS1 allele and not the PrpS3 or PrpS8\nalleles. The plot shows that the rescue is clearly bimodal, with some pollen tubes\n\nstill strongly inhibited, whereas others have alleviated inhibition, which gives\n\nconfidence to the mean data shown in Fig. 3.\n\nWe designed these experiments to be reciprocal so that we could demonstrate\n\nallelic specificity of rescue and to rule out some nonspecific effects, as if the\n\nantisense PrpS1 caused pollen tubes to grow longer for some other reason, we\n\nshould see this effect with the pollen from plants with S3S8 haplotypes. Sense\n\noligonucleotides were used as additional controls, in order to demonstrate that\n\nthe antisense oligonucleotides specifically had this effect on pollen tube growth.\n\nThese assays provide a robust test of whether PrpS1 and PrpS8 are allelic, as we\n\nshow that they have the same biological function and they exhibit allelic specifi-\n\ncity. If PrpS8 was not allelic to PrpS1, then it would not affect pollen tube growth\n\nas predicted. Statistical tests were carried out using MINITAB. Tests comprised\n\ntwo-way comparisons between pairs of data using a Student\u2019s t-test.\n\nPeptide bioassay. A 15-amino-acid peptide corresponding to part of the pre-\ndicted 35-amino-acid PrpS1 external loop region was designed and two rando-\n\nmized versions of this peptide were synthesized (see Methods Summary for\n\ndetails). P. rhoeas pollen was grown in vitro and self-incompatibility induced\n\nusing recombinant PrsS1, PrsS3 and PrsS8 (ref. 42). Self-incompatibility-induced\n\npollen inhibition was compared with self-incompatibility in the presence of the\n\nPrpS1 peptide or a randomized peptide at 200mgml\n21\n. Pollen grains and tubes\n\nwere scored after 1 h, using two categories: \u2018inhibition\u2019 or \u2018growth\u2019; a minimum\n\nof 100 pollen grains/tubes was scored for each sample. Data were analysed using\n\nFisher\u2019s exact test for 23 2 contingency tables43.\n\nPrimers used for the isolation of PrpS alleles.

J. de Graaf, Natalie Hadjiosif, \nRuth M. Perry, Natalie S. Poulter, Kim Osman, \nSabina Vatovec, Andrea Harper, F. Christopher, H. Franklin & \nVernonica E. Franklin-Tong\n\nNature 459, 992\u2013995 (2009); doi:10.1038/nature08027\n\nRecently, it has come to our attention that in the left panel of Fig. 2b of \nthis Letter, the lanes labelled S2S4 and S6S17 were duplicated. We have \nreviewed the original data. It seems likely that a duplicated part of the \nblot was placed over lane S6S17 to aid alignment of molecular mass \nmarkers and inadvertently left there. We have now removed the dupli-\ncated lane and show the whole western blot (Fig. 1). Our conclusions \nare unaffected.\n\nCORRECTIONS & AMENDMENTS\n\nFigure 1 | This is the corrected left panel of Fig. 2b. The right panel \nshowing the Coomassie staining is not shown.\n\nb\n\nkDa\n\n50\n\n36\n\n22\n\n16\n\nS 1\nS 3\n\nS 3\nS 8\n\nS 8\nS 15\n\nS 2\nS 4\n\nS 6\nS 17\n\nhttp://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature16181\nhttp://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature08027\n\n\tIdentification of the pollen self-incompatibility determinant in Papaver rhoeas\n\tMain\n\tMethods Summary\n\tCloning of PrpS1, PrpS3 and PrpS8\n\tKa/Ks calculations\n\tPeptide binding assay\n\tAntisense oligonucleotide silencing of PrpS expression\n\n\tOnline Methods\n\tSequence homology comparisons\n\tSouthern blotting\n\tStructural predictions for PrpS and interpretation of the data\n\tLinkage analysis\n\tRT\u2013PCR to show tissue and developmental specificity\n\tProduction of antisera\n\tProtein extraction for SDS\u2013PAGE and western blotting\n\tImmunolocalization\n\tThe in vitro bioassay for Papaver self-incompatibility: use of this as an assay for function\n\tPeptide bioassay\n\tPrimers used for the isolation of PrpS alleles\n\tGene-specific primers used for S-locus linkage analysis\n\n\tAcknowledgements\n\tReferences\n\n\n\n\n",
