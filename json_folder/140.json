The inhibitory effect was reverted by PI3K inhibitors. The sub-G1\nphase cells after ellipticine treatment appeared at the expense of those that accumulated first at S- and\nG2/M phases during the early stage of treatment.

They disappeared upon co-treatment with wortmannin and\nthe apoptotic phenotype reversed. Furthermore, ellipticine regulated endogenous survival signaling by\nup-regulating phosphorylated Akt that returned to its basal level later. Furthermore, ellipticine induced\nnucleus translocalization of p53 and Akt and recruitment of autophagosomes. The autophagic-related cell\ndeath was interfered by wortmannin and the suppressed growth reverted. The Akt-related cell death also\noccurred in p53-deficient cells with stable expression of exogenous p53. The work showed that ellipticine-\n\nCT\nED\ninduced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells was achieved through autophagy and apoptotic death as a result of\nAkt-modulation.

Introduction\n\nEllipticine (5,11-dimethyl-6H-pyrido[4,3-b]carbazole), one of\nhe naturally occurring alkaloids, was isolated from the leaves of\nhe evergreen tree Ochrosia elliptica Labill (Apocynaceae) found in\nceania. The drug and its analogues are known to inhibit topoiso-\nerase II activity in human cancer cells. Ellipticine analogues are\n\nctive against brain tumor cell lines [1] and proved potent against\npanel of cancer cells [2]. The drug was promising in treating\netastatic breast cancer and brain tumors [3]. The anticancer activ-\n\nties of ellipticine and its derivatives, such as 9-methoxyellipticine,\netelliptine, ellipticiniums, 9-hydroxyellipticine and 9-chloro-2-\nethylellipticinium have also been reported effective against a\n\nanel of cancer cell lines [3\u20139]. Although ellipticine and their\nRE\n\nTR\n\nerivatives are known capable of intercalating DNA, generating\nytotoxic free radicals and uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation\n10\u201312], its efficacy in human lung cancer cells and the associated\nction mechanisms were not completely understood.\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

In this work, we further described\nhat the proliferation of human NSCLC cells A549 can be sup-\nressed by ellipticine and the inclusion of PI3K inhibitors blocked\nhe inhibitory effects. Being a topoisomerase II inhibitor, the drug\nestrained proliferation by arresting cells at S- and G2/M transition\ntates prior to induction of sub-G1 cell populations. The ini-\nial drug-mediated phosphorylation of Akt-serine473 (Akt-Ser473)\nelped in maintaining cell viabilities at the initial stage of drug\nreatment. However, the induced up-regulated p53 and the subse-\nuent Akt dephosphorylation lead to poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase\nPARP) fragmentation and final apoptosis. Further analysis revealed\nhat ellipticine caused nucleus translocation of both p53 and\nhosphorylated Akt as well as the development of autophagic\nells. The effects were attenuated by wortmannin, which blocked\nhe apoptotic phenotype. The work demonstrated that ellip-\n\nicine induced cytotoxicity in A549 cells by modulating signaling\nathway and subcellular redistribution of Akt and p53. Thus,\nI3K-regulated autophagic cell development by controlling cell\nrowth provided a new dimension for topoisomerase II inhibitor,\nllipticine.\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcan\nmailto:biofv033@scc.ntnu.edu.tw\nmailto:kangfang@ntnu.edu.tw\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2008.05.026\n\n\n2 ancer\n\n2\n\n2\ni\n\nA\nG\nl\ni\nA\nc\nI\n\nd\ne\nD\n\n2\nv\n\nM\nd\n9\nc\nm\ni\n(\nr\nt\nw\n\n2\ns\n\ni\nw\nt\n5\nb\np\nfi\nM\no\nm\n\nm\nm\n\n2\nt\n\nt\nt\nD\nw\np\nf\no\nc\nm\na\n\nt\nt\ne\nm\n\n2\n\nw\nb\na\np\na\nt\nw\nn\nb\np\n(\nw\np\nL\nw\nE\n\n2\n\nc\ni\nP\n0\nb\n1\nt\n(\nt\nw\na\n\n3\n\n3\nw\n\ni\nm\n(\nl\n3\n(\nl\n5\n1\na\nf\nt\na\n\n3\n\nA\n\n28 K. Fang et al. / Lung C\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1. Cell lines and monolayer growth determination of NSCLC cells\nn culture\n\nHuman lung cell carcinoma cell lines H322, H1437, H1299 and\n549 were acquired from ATCC and grown in DMEM (Invitrogen,\nrands Islands, NY). All cultured cells were supplemented with\n-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and supplemented with 7% heat-\nnactivated FCS in the humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 \u25e6C.\nll cell lines were examined and found to be free of mycoplasma\nontamination using a MycoTect kit (Invitrogen, Grands\nslands, NY).\n\nThe H1299 cells transfected with cytomegalovirus promoter-\nriven pcDNA-p53 consisting of full-length wild-type p53 were\nstablished previously and maintained in serum-supplemented\nMEM [14].\n\n.2. MTT assay determination for proliferation rate and cell\niability evaluation\n\nThe effect of cell proliferation by ellipticine (Sigma, St. Louis,\nO) was measured by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-\n\niphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, cells were plated in\n6-well culture plates (5 \u00d7 103 cells/well). After 24 h incubation, the\nells were treated with different concentrations of ellipticine. Fifty\nicroliters of MTT test solution was added to each well. After 4 h\n\nncubation, the absorbance was measured on an ELISA plate reader\nMultiskan EX, Labsystems) at a test wavelength of 492 nm and a\neference wavelength of 690 nm. The viability of untreated cells in\nhe presence of diluted vehicle control was regarded as 100%. The\norks were conducted in three different experiments.\n\n.3. Flow cytometry of cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide\ntaining\n\nTo determine phase distribution of DNA content, propidium\nodide (PI) staining was performed. Briefly, 3 \u00d7 105 cells collected\n\nere washed once and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. After cen-\nrifugation at 700 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u25e6C, cell pellet was stained with\n\ufffdg/ml PI (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) plus 0.5 mg/ml RNaseA in PBS\nuffer for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The analysis was\nerformed with FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mans-\neld, MA). Cell cycle distributions were analyzed by Cell-Quest and\nodfit software (Becton-Dickinson, Mansfield, MA). The statistics\n\nf cell distributions were calculated from three individual experi-\nents.\nTo test the inhibitory effect, the cells were treated with wort-\n\nannin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 24 h prior to addition of fresh\nedia and ellipticine of specified concentrations.\n\n.4. Green fluorescent protein-tagged light-chain 3 plasmid\nransfection\n\nA549 cells were grown on sterile histologic slides, and, after 24 h\nhe cells, were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-\nagged light-chain 3 (LC3) plasmid (a gift from Dr. Wei-Pang Huang,\nepartment of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Tai-\nan) using a mixture of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and GFP-LC3\nlasmid in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 5 \ufffdl Lipo-\n\nRE\nTR\nectAMINE per milliliter of medium per 1 \ufffdl plasmid. After 6 h\nf incubation, cells were placed in regular complete medium and\nultured for 1 day. After cells were treated with ellipticine and wort-\nannin or vehicle control for 2 days, the medium was changed,\n\nnd cells were further incubated for 24 h at 37 \u25e6C. The slides were\n\ns\nr\n\nC\n\n63 (2009) 227\u2013234\n\nhen washed with PBS, and cells fixed in cold methanol. Cells were\nhen washed in PBS twice, and coverslips were mounted with glyc-\nrol/PBS (3:1) solution. Slides were examined under a fluorescent\nicroscope (Leica).\n\n.5. Western blot analysis\n\nCells cultured in 0.5% serum-supplemented media were treated\nith ellipticine were washed with PBS and scraped in lysate\n\nuffer containing 1% triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1%\nprotonin, 5 mM PMSF and 10 \ufffdg/ml leupeptin in 20 mM sodium\nhosphate. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA\nssay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and 20 \ufffdg of total pro-\nein was performed for Western blots analysis. Protein samples\nere electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to\nitrocellulose filters). The blots were then incubated in fresh\nlocking solution and probed for 1 h with 1:3000 dilution of\n53, pAkt-Ser473, Akt, GSK3\ufffd, pGSK3\ufffd-Ser21 and PARP antibodies\nCell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), respectively. Blots were\nashed twice in PBS-T and then incubated with a 1:4000 dilution of\neroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Kirkegaard and Perry\naboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) in PBS-T for 1 h at 22 \u25e6C. Blots\nere again washed twice for 10 min in PBS-T and then detected by\n\nCL illumination system (Amersham).\n\n.6. Immunofluorescence analysis\n\nThe cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in PBS\nontaining 3.7% formaldehyde. The fixed coverslips were washed\nn PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed twice in\nBS (5 min), and incubated in a blocking buffer (PBS containing\n.2% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. The cells were then incu-\nated in the blocking buffer containing the primary antibody for\nh and washed three times in PBS (5 min) before incubation with\n\nhe appropriate TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody plus DAPI\nMolecular Probes Inc.) for further 30 min. The cells were washed\nhree times in PBS (5 min) and washed in water. The stained cells\nere mounted on glass slides and examined for fluorescence under\nfluorescent microscope (Leica).\n\n. Results\n\n.1. Growth inhibition induced by ellipticine was neutralized by\nortmannin\n\nTo evaluate the effects of ellipticine on cell growth, the viabilities\nn human lung cancer cells with various p53 genotypes were deter-\n\nined. Compared to H322 (p53 mutant p53 (R248L)) and H1437\nmutant p53 (R267P)), cell viabilities of ellipticine-treated epithe-\nial NSCLC cells A549 (wild-typed p53) were reduced to less than\n0% with increased concentrations of the drug using MTT assay\nFig. 1A). Compared with cells treated with vehicle control alone,\ness than 50% of the cells were left after 48 h after treating with\n\ufffdM ellipticine. The viable cells were further reduced to less than\n0% after 96 h. The induced growth inhibition in A549 cells was\nbrogated progressively by increasing wortmannin concentrations\nrom 100 to 200 nM and by LY294002. Similar to vehicle control,\nreatment with wortmannin alone exerted no effect on cell growth\nt all in culture (Fig. 1B).\n\n.2. Ellipticine arrested A549 cells at S- and G2/M transition\n\nCT\nED\ntates prior to inducing sub-G1 phase cells and the effect can be\neverted by wortmannin\n\nCell cycle distributions were determined by flow cytometry.\nompared with A549 cells with vehicle control alone, ellipticine\n\n\n\nK. Fang et al. / Lung Cancer\n\nFig. 1. (A) Cell viabilities of H322, H1437 and A549 cells with various concentra-\ntions of ellipticine Cells were seeded into 6-well plates (5 \u00d7 103 cells/well). After\n24 h for complete adherence, the cells were incubated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO)\nand different concentrations of ellipticine (0, 2, 5 and 10 \ufffdM, respectively). After\n48 h of treatment, 50 \ufffdl of MTT solution were added into the cells. After incuba-\ntion, the absorbance was measured on an ELISA plate reader at a test wavelength\nof 492 nm with a reference wavelength of 690 nm. The cell viabilities were deter-\nmined as percentages of vehicles controls.

The decreased\n\nA\n\nllipticine affected by various PI3K inhibitors. A549 cells were cultured with ellip-\nicine together with wortmannin or LY294002 for the hours (h) specified. Cells were\nrypsinized and the viable cells counted by Trypan blue exclusion assay. The error\nars represented standard errors in three independent experiments conducted.\n\nrrested cells at S- and G2/M-transition states beginning on the\nrst day (Fig. 2). Cells of sub-G1 phase appeared 3 days later; while\nhose at G2/M phase decreased simultaneously. As wortmannin\noncentrations were increased from 100 to 200 nM, cells at sub-\n1 state disappeared proportionally and most of them remained\nt S- and G2/M check points. The results implied that the onset of\nllipticine-induced cell death involves Akt signaling and wortman-\nin blocked cell progression mostly at S- and G2/M phases, whereas\nells of sub-G1 state were reduced. The cell population distribution\ny wortmannin alone is not affected and similar to that of vehicle\nontrol.\n\n.3. Ellipticine phosphorylates Akt at serine-473 first before being\nephosphorylated in A549 cells that can be associated with the\nppearance of apoptotic signals\n\nPARP is a key participant in DNA base excision repair and in\n\nRE\nTR\naintaining genome integrity [15]. The appearance of proteolytic\nleavage of the precursor PARP marked the final commitment of\npoptosis. In drug-treated A549 cells, the intense 89-kDa fragment\nf PARP in Western blot serves as a hallmark of apoptosis (Fig. 3).\n\nv\np\nc\nb\n\n63 (2009) 227\u2013234 229\n\nhe induced p53 was no longer observed 48 h after treatment. The\nnduced MDM2 at 48 h was associated with degradation of tran-\niently activated p53. The effect was suppressed by wortmannin\nnd the induced apoptosis reverted.\n\nThe enhanced phosphorylation serine-473 of Akt was detected\nday after ellipticine treatment as indicated by Western blot\n\nFig. 4A). The intensity of phosphorylated Akt was increased by\nore than 2-fold before final dephosphorylation (Fig. 4B). The\n\nffect was blocked by wortmannin and proved reproducible. On the\nther hand, Akt-dependent phosphorylation on serine-21 of glyco-\nen synthase kinase-3\ufffd (GSK3\ufffd), a downstream target specific for\nkt, was increased and then returned to its basal level, while the\n\nntensities of GSK3\ufffd were unchanged. The addition of wortmannin\nuppressed the transient phosphorylation.\n\n.4. Ellipticine induced nucleus translocation of Akt in A549 cells\n\nBy analyzing protein extracts from cytoplasmic and nuclear frac-\nions, Akt was found migrated into nucleus following ellipticine\nreatment. Both cytoplasmic and nucleus Akt was found phospho-\nylated after drug treatment as evidenced from Akt-Ser473-specific\nntibody incubation (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the phosphory-\nated Akt was found only in cytoplasmic fraction after wortmannin\nreatment. Besides, in immunostaining experiments, phosphory-\nated Akt located in both nucleus and cytoplasm after ellipticine\nreatment, was retained in cytoplasm by wortmannin (Fig. 5B). In\nddition, nucleus translocation of p53 was also assisted by ellip-\nicine, and the movement was blocked when cultured together\nith wortmannin as shown in p53 antibody-stained fluorescence\n\nxperiment.\n\n.5. Increased autophagy is associated with ellipticine-induced\npoptosis in A549 cells\n\nAutophagy has gained increasing attention as an alternative\noute toward cell death. Microtubule-associated light chain LC3 is\nn important component during autophagosome formation. The\nse of the GFP-tagged LC3 plasmid has become an effective marker\nor the autophagy progression. A549 cells were transfected with\nFP-LC3 plasmid and the distribution of GFP can be detected. As\nhown in Fig. 6A, diffuse cytoplasmic localization of GFP-LC3 was\nbserved in untreated A549 cells, whereas ellipticine-treated cells\ncquired increased punctate fluorescence that overlapped with\nysotracker positive spots after 48 h, which suggested the pres-\nnce of autophagic cells relevant to apoptosis. The increases in\nunctate fluorescence by ellipticine can be neutralized in cells\nreated with 3-methyladenine (3-MA). In addition, the viability\nas observed increased in cells treated with increasing concentra-\n\nions of 3-MA compared to those with ellipticine alone, indicating\nhat the autophagy attributed to apoptotic cell death due to ellip-\nicine (Fig. 6B). Thus, autophagic cells are closely related to the\nnset of apoptotic tumor cell killing, suggesting the importance of\nutophagy in ellipticine-mediated growth inhibition.\n\n.6. Ellipticine-induced Akt nuclear translocation and apoptosis\ns dependent on p53\n\nBoth H1299 cells lacking p53 and the stable clone H1299-p53\nith exogenous p53 were tested with ellipticine. Compared to\n1299 cells, cell viabilities of ellipticine-treated H1299-p53 cells\n\nCT\nED\niability was recovered by wortmannin. In Western blot analysis,\n53 level and phosphorylated Akt were elevated in H1299-p53\nlone in the presence of ellipticine and the increased expression\nlocked by wortmannin (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, wortmannin\n\n\n\n230 K. Fang et al. / Lung Cancer 63 (2009) 227\u2013234\n\nFig. 2. Cell cycle histograms analysis of ellipticine-treated A549 cells with or without wortmannin.

Discussion\n\nMore detailed mechanisms on the drug action concerning\nllipticine-induced cell death were gradually uncovered. Previ-\nus studies reported that p53 and Fas/Fas ligand death receptor\nre involved in ellipticine-mediated cell growth inhibition [5,7].\nore work indicated that ellipticine induced endoplasmic retic-\n\nlum stress that contributed to the drug cytotoxicity [1]. Ellipticine\n\nRE\nT\n\ns capable of activating p53 downstream responsive elements and,\nherefore, causing apoptotic cell death in cells in a panel of can-\ner cells as an effective growth inhibitor [2,4,16]. As an effective\nopoisomerase II inhibitor that specifically acted in A549 lung can-\ner cells, ellipticine arrested cells first at S- and G2/M check points\n\nd\nr\nt\na\nw\n\nted overlapped with Lysotracker in ellipticine-treated A549 cells.

The final growth inhi-\nition was blocked by wortmannin by suppressing sub-G1 cell\nopulation and the viable cells increased proportionally.\n\nDNA damage in cells causes either irreversible senescence or\npoptosis in tumor cells [14,17\u201319]. The characteristic marker\nor apoptosis, cleaved PARP in response to environmental stress,\nppeared on the third day after treatment. The late appearance\nf intense 89-kDa fragment of nuclear polymerase PARP involved\nn DNA repair marked delayed apoptotic cell death following pro-\nonged cell arrest. In this work, we showed that ellipticine inhibited\nhe growth of A549 cells by first activating p53 accompanied with\nleavage of 116-kDa precursor, PARP, into 89-kDa fragment. The\nreakdown of the induced p53 and MDM2 began on the third\n\nay and the effect was suppressed by wortmannin. The delayed\nesponse to topoisomerase inhibitor in carcinoma cells with wild-\nype p53 can be characterized by prolonged cell arrest without\npparent apoptosis [20,21]. For instance, the growth of NSCLC cells\nas blocked at G2/M phase and exhibited senescence-like state\n\n\n\nK. Fang et al. / Lung Cancer 63 (2009) 227\u2013234 233\n\nFig. 7.

Previous report indicated that treatment\nith cisplatin, etoposide, or vincristine to murine hematopoietic\n\nells led to initial up-regulation of phosphorylated Akt, followed\ny rapid dephosphorylation to its basal level and the drug resis-\nance was increased without suppressing cell growth [22]. Our\nork demonstrated that ellipticine arrested A549 cells first at G2/M\nhase by modulating Akt phosphorylation before final commit-\nent to cell death. How cells were retained at G2/M phase along\nith transient Akt phosphorylation is not completely understood.\n\nAkt phosphorylation by ellipticine was terminated by wort-\nannin (Fig. 4B), and the effect attenuated ellipticine-induced cell\n\neath. Since functional PTEN was reportedly active in A549 cells\n23], the ellipticine-induced phosphorylation of Akt on serine-473\nould be attributed to PTEN activation. In some cases, treatment\nith wortmannin alone is sufficient to inhibit Akt activity and cell\nroliferation, thereby promoting apoptosis [24,25]. In this work,\nhen wortmannin is included in culture, the ellipticine-mediated\nhosphorylation became inactivated and nucleus translocation of\nkt blocked. The results further suggested that, despite brief Akt\nctivation, ellipticine eventually acts as a specific inhibitor of the\nkt-dependent signaling pathway, thereby making it an effective\nrug in treating lung cancer.\n\nAkt activation promotes survival of NSCLC cells [23]. The\nctivated Akt can be located to cell membrane in response to\ntimulation by growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1\nIGF-1). After mitogenic stimulation, Akt phosphorylates multiple\n\nRE\nTR\n\nA\n\nubstrates related to cell cycle progression and lead to reduction\nf p53transactivation [26]. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain\nf Akt was reportedly a membrane-targeting module. After\nGF-1stimulation, the PH domain of Akt is required for nucleus\nranslocation and the movement terminated by wortmannin [27].\n\na\ni\na\nl\nt\n\n4000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and then\n299-p53 cells plated on coverslips in 60-cm plates were treated with ellipticine in\n\ned, stained with Akt antibody (red) and counterstained with DAPI to visualize the\n\nince there is no nuclear signal sequence, how Akt is introduced\nnto nucleus, phosphorylated and affects downstream regulators\nn NSCLC cells including apoptosis signals awaits further investiga-\nion. It will be of great value to determine how ellipticine interacts\nith Akt and assists in its nuclear translocalization. While ellip-\n\nicine promoted Akt nucleus translocation and phosphorylation,\nhe activation may stabilize p53 without binding to Mdm2 and\nherefore slow down the ubiquitination and degradation of p53\n28]. The activation of p53 also might block the anti-apoptotic\nffects of Akt, thereby leading to apoptosis [29]. The present\nork was conducted in A549 cells and in the stable clones with\n\nxogenous p53. Whether the effect is applicable in other cells\nemains to be seen. Unlike A549 cells, an enhanced Akt phos-\nhorylation at serine-473 in both H322 and H1437 cells carrying\nutated p53 was not detected (data not shown) and treatment\nith ellipticine did not affect their growth rate. Thus, it is likely\n\nhat wild-type p53 and Akt act together in leading cell death by\nllipticine. However, our results do not rule out the possibility\nhat Akt directly promotes p53 stabilization and final degradation\nhrough different regulatory mechanisms.\n\nTumor cells may undergo both apoptosis and autophagy in\nesponse to some anticancer drugs, and the two pathways may\nccur separately or simultaneously. The disruption of the PI3K/Akt\nignaling pathway enhanced autophagy and induced apoptosis\nhat contributed to the drug effectiveness in malignant glioma\nells [30]. Modulation of Akt activity through pharmacological\n\nC\n\npproaches promises good implication toward therapeutic modal-\nties [24]. It has been shown that tumor suppressor PTEN mediates\nutophagy [31]. The deficiencies in suppression of autophagy can\nead to malignant transformation [32].
