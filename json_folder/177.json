Tumor necrosis\nfactor (TNF)-a is chronically elevated in adipose tissues of obese rodents and humans. Increased levels of\nTNF-a are implicated in the induction of atherogenic adipokines, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor\n(PAI)-1, adipose-tissue-derived monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and interleukin (IL)-6. Aucu-\nbin, an iridoid glycoside existing in medicinal plants, has been reported to show an anti-inflammatory\nactivity by suppression of TNF-a production in murine macrophages. The present study is aimed to inves-\ntigate the effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced atherogenic changes of the adipokines in differentiated\n3T3-L1 cells. Aucubin significantly inhibited TNF-a-induced secretion and mRNA synthesis of the athero-\ngenic adipokines including PAI-1, MCP-1, and IL-6. Further investigation of the molecular mechanism\nrevealed that pretreatment with aucubin suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activa-\ntion, inhibitory kappa Ba (IjBa) degradation, and subsequent nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB) activation.\nThese findings suggest that aucubin may improve obesity-induced atherosclerosis by attenuating TNF-a-\ninduced inflammatory responses.\n\n\ufffd 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nObesity, which is characterized by excessive accumulation of\nabdominal fat, is casually associated with the premature develop-\nment of atherosclerosis, increased risk of stroke, and development\nof congestive heart failure [1]. Recent studies have indicated that\nthe adipocyte secretes a variety of adipokines involved in energy\nmetabolism, inflammation, and cardiovascular functions [2]. The\ncellular mechanisms linking obesity and atherosclerosis are com-\nplex and have not been fully elucidated. However, increasing evi-\ndences suggest that the changes of adipokines including PAI-1,\nMCP-1, and IL-6 due to excess adipose tissue may be a cause of ath-\nerosclerosis [3].\n\nPlasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is the primary inhibitor\nof plasminogen activation. Plasma levels of PAI-1 are markedly ele-\nvated in obese individuals as well as in patients with insulin resis-\ntance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [4,5]. PAI-\n1 is thought to be the link between obesity and increased risk for\nCVDs [6]. Although several tissues are known to produce PAI-1,\nll rights reserved.\n\nllege of Natural Science and\n, Sangdang-gu, Cheongju-si,\n\n8566; fax: +82 43 229 8559.\nadipose tissue appears to be the major contributor to elevated\nPAI-1 levels observed in cases of obesity [7,8]. Monocyte chemoat-\ntractant protein (MCP)-1 chemotactically recruits monocytes to\nsites of inflammation. Although this protein is traditionally\nthought to be expressed mainly endothelial cells and macrophages,\nit has been shown to be primarily expressed by adipose tissues\n[9,10]. Adipocyte-derived MCP-1 induces macrophage infiltration\ninto adipose tissues and thus secretes inflammatory cytokines\nincluding tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, which in turn leads to\nthe dysfunction of adipocytes [11]. In addition, MCP-1 inhibits\ninsulin-dependent glucose uptake and the expression of adipo-\ngenic genes [10].\n\nAucubin is a natural constituent with a monoterpene cyclic ring\nsystem found in a wide range of some insects and higher plants\nsuch as Aucuba japonica and Plantago asiatica [12,13]. In recent\nyears, a variety of bio-activities of aucubin have been reported; li-\nver-protective activities against hepato-toxicants, stimulation of\nbile acid excretion, anti-microbial activities, anti-tumor activities,\nantidotal activities for noxious amanita mushroom poisoning,\nanti-viral activities against hepatitis B virus, and anti-inflamma-\ntory activities [14\u201322]. Interestingly, a number of plants containing\naucubin have been used long as medicinal herbs for anti-inflam-\nmatics and anti-rheumatics in Oriental and Occidental hemi-\nspheres. As for the molecular mechanism for anti-inflammatory\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.005\nmailto:parkks@cju.ac.kr\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.005\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine\n\n\n408 K.S.

However,\nthe inhibitory effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced inflammatory\nresponses in adipocytes have not been reported previously.\n\nThe present study was designed to determine whether it atten-\nuates TNF-a-induced secretion and mRNA production of the ath-\nerogenic adipokines including PAI-1, MCP-1, and IL-6 in\ndifferentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, the possible mecha-\nnisms for inhibitory effects of aucubin on obesity-related inflam-\nmatory responses were examined.\nFig. 1. Effects of aucubin on TNF-a-stimulated adipokine production in 3T3-L1\nadipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed or not to increasing concentrations of\naucubin (1, 3, 10, and 30 lM) for 6 h and then were stimulated for 24 h by the\naddition of 10 ng/mL TNF-a. The secreted antigens of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 in\nconditioned medium were measured as described in Section 2. Results represent\nthe mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. ##p < 0.01 versus untreated\ncontrol; \ufffdp < 0.05, \ufffd\ufffdp < 0.01 versus TNF-a-stimulated control.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Reagents\n\nAucubin with 99.5% purity was purchased from Wako Pure\nChemical Industries Ltd., (Osaka, Japan). Recombinant murine tu-\nmor necrosis factor (TNF)-a was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,\nMN, USA). Insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxan-\nthine were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). All tissue culture mate-\nrials were from Gibco-BRL (Rockville, MD, USA). Primary anti-mouse\nantibodies for extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), phos-\npho-ERK, IjBa, phospho-IjBa, and b-actin were obtained from Cell\nSignaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Poly (ADP-ribose) poly-\nmerase (PARP) and p65 monoclonal antibodies were purchased\nfrom Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).\n\n2.2. 3T3-L1 cell culture and treatment\n\n3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Rock-\nville, MD) were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium\n(DMEM) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% (v/v) penicil-\nlin\u2013streptomycin (10,000 U/mL penicillin and 10,000 cg/mL strep-\ntomycin in 0.85% saline), and 1% (v/v) 100 lM pyruvate at 37 \ufffdC\nin 95% air 10% CO2. Differentiation of 2-day postconfluent preadi-\npocytes (designated as day 0) was initiated with 0.5 mM 3-isobu-\ntyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 lM dexamethasone, and 1 lg/mL insulin\nin DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h\n(day 2), the culture medium was replaced with DMEM supple-\nmented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 lg/mL insulin, and\nthe cells were then fed every other day with DMEM containing\n10% fetal bovine serum. Aucubin was reconstituted, filter sterilized,\nand stored at \ufffd20 \ufffdC. For each experiment, cells received aucubin\npremixed with culture medium. TNF-a treatment was carried out\nafter a 6-h pretreatment with aucubin. Aucubin was dissolved in\ndimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before it was added to culture medium.\nThe final concentration of DMSO in culture medium was 0.5% (v/v).\n\n2.3. Measurement of adipokines by ELISA\n\nThe conditioned culture medium from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was\ncollected from each sample. The concentrations of MCP-1, PAI-1,\nand IL-6 were assayed using a mouse MCP-1 ELISA kit (R&D Sys-\ntems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), a mouse PAI-1 ELISA kit (Molecular\nInnovations Inc., Southfield, MI, USA), and a mouse IL-6 ELISA kit\n(Biosource Inc., Camarillo, CA, USA), respectively. All assays were\nperformed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n2.4. Evaluation of gene expression levels by quantitative real-time RT-\nPCR\n\nFor real-time RT-PCR, cDNA was prepared from 1 lg total RNA\nin a final reaction volume of 15 lL. Real-time RT-PCR was per-\nformed using 2 lL cDNA diluted with each of the gene-specific pri-\nmer sets (Bioneer Inc., Korea). Each primer set was used at a\nconcentration of 150 nM in a final reaction volume of 20 lL and\nreactions were performed on the Lightcycler 480 SYBR Green I\nMaster (Roche Applied Science, Germany). The sequences for\nprimers are: MCP-1 (50-GCCCCACTCACCTGCTGCTACT-30 and 50-\nCCTGCTGCTGGTGATCCTCTTGT-30), PAI-1 (50-AGGATCGAGGT-\nAAACGAGAGC-30 and 50-GCGGGCTGAGATGACAAA-30), and IL-6\n(50-GCTACCAAACTGGATATAATCAGGA-30 and 50-CCAGGTAGCTA-\nTGGTACTCCAGAA-30). Levels of mRNA, expressed as relative mRNA\nlevels compared with control, were calculated after normalization\nto b-actin.\n\n2.5. Nuclear extraction\n\nNuclear fractions of cells were prepared as previously described\n[23]. Briefly, cells were scraped and suspended in 400 lL of cold\nbuffer A (HEPES 10 mM; pH 7.9; KCl 10 mM; EDTA 0.1 mM; EGTA\n0.1 mM; dithiothreitol 1 mM; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride\n0.5 mM; pepstatin A 1 lg/mL; leupeptin 10 lg/mL; aprotinin\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced adipokine mRNA synthesis in 3T3-L1\nadipocytes. After exposure to various concentrations of aucubin (1, 3, 10, and\n30 lM) for 6 h, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with 10 ng/mL TNF-a for 24 h.\nThen cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted for measuring the mRNA\nlevels of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 by quantitative RT-PCR. Values are normalized to b-\nactin RNA expression levels and expressed relative to untreated control cells.\nResults represent the mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. ##p < 0.01\nversus untreated control; \ufffd\ufffdp < 0.01 versus TNF-a-stimulated control.\n\nFig. 3.

The precipitated cell pellet were used\nas the nuclear fraction for immunoblot assay. And the precipitated\ncell pellet was re-suspended with shaking in 100 lL of buffer B\n(HEPES 20 mM; pH 7.9; NaCl 400 mM; EDTA 1 mM; EGTA 1 mM;\ndithiothreitol 1 mM; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.5 mM; pep-\nstatin A 1 lg/mL; leupeptin 10 lg/mL; aprotinin 10 lg/mL), and\ncentrifuged for 15 min at 10,000g. The supernatant aliquots\n(70 lL) were used for assay.\nand 30 lM) of aucubin for 6 h, then TNF-a (10 ng/mL) for 24 h, were prepared for\nthe Western blotting of p65 of NF-jB using specific anti-p65 monoclonal antibody.\nPARP was used as internal controls. Density ratios versus PARP were determined by\ndensitometry. The data shown are representative of three independent experi-\nments. The values shown are means \u00b1 SD. ##p < 0.01 versus untreated control;\n\ufffd\ufffdp < 0.01 versus TNF-a-only treated control.\n2.6. Western blot analysis\n\nCell lysates were collected, and then protein concentrations\nwere determined with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay re-\nagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amounts\nof cell extracts were separated by electrophoresis using a 10% SDS\u2013\npolyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes\n(Whatman Protran, Whatman GmBH, Dassel, Germany). After\nbeing blocked at room temperature in 5% non-fat dry milk with\nTris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST) buffer for 2 h, the blots were\nprobed with the primary antibody against each target protein at a\nconcentration of 1:500\u20131:1000 in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST\novernight at 4 \ufffdC. Bound antibodies were detected by horseradish\nperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and signals were de-\ntected and quantified using a chemiluminescent detection system,\nLAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Japan).\n2.7. Statistics\n\nData expressed as mean \u00b1 SD were obtained from three separate\nexperiments. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by one-\nway analysis of variance followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. P < 0.05 was\nconsidered to have significant difference.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced secretion of adipokines in\n3T3-L1 adipocytes\n\nTo examine the effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced secretion\nof adipokines, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with various\nconcentrations of aucubin for 6 h and then incubated with 10 ng/\nmL TNF-a for 24 h. After incubation, conditioned medium was col-\nlected for ELISA assay. Treatment with aucubin inhibited TNF-a-in-\nduced increase in the secretion of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 in dose-\ndependent manner with IC50 of 8.20, 9.94, and 6.85 lM, respec-\ntively (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced IjBa degradation and ERK phosphorylation. (A) Effects of aucubin on IjBa protein phosphorylation and degradation. Following\npretreatment with aucubin (1, 3, 10, and 30 lM) for 6 h, cells were treated with TNF-a (10 ng/mL) for 15 min. Total proteins were prepared and Western blotting was\nperformed using specific p-IjBa and IjBa antibodies. PD98059 (PD, 20 lM) was used as an ERK1/2-specific inhibitor. (B) Time-dependent changes of TNF-a-induced ERK\nphosphorylation. After stimulation with TNF-a (10 ng/mL), whole cell lysates prepared at different times (5, 15, 30, 60 min) were analyzed by Western blotting using specific\np-ERK and ERK antibodies. (C) Effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced ERK phosphorylation. Following pretreatment with aucubin (1, 3, 10, and 30 lM) for 6 h, cells were\ntreated with TNF-a (10 ng/mL) for 15 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared and Western blotting was performed using specific p-ERK and ERK antibodies. Density ratios\nversus b-actin or ERK were determined by densitometry. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.

Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced expression of adipokine\ngenes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes\n\nTo investigate whether aucubin inhibited TNF-a-induced secre-\ntion of adipokines by altering the gene expression, real-time quan-\ntitative RT-PCR was carried out with total RNA extracted from 3T3-\nL1 adipocytes of each group. The gene expression of adipokines\nwas measured after 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to aucubin\nfor 6 h prior to TNF-a (10 ng/mL) treatment for 24 h. The enhanced\nproduction of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 mRNA by TNF-a was sup-\npressed by aucubin pretreatment (Fig. 2). At a aucubin concentra-\ntion of 10 lM, the mRNA production of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 was\nsuppressed by 36.5%, 24.3%, and 39.0%, respectively.\n\n3.3. Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced nuclear translocation of\nNF-jB\n\nSince NF-jB is a major transcription factor that modulates the\nexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, it was investigated\nwhether aucubin prevents the translocation of the p65 subunit of\nNF-jB from cytosol into the nucleus using Western blotting. It\nwas found that aucubin prior to TNF-a significantly attenuated\np65 level in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3).\n\n3.4. Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced phosphorylation of IjBa\nand ERK\n\nIn unstimulated adipocytes, NF-jB is sequested in the cytosol\nby its inhibitor IjBa, and when cells are stimulated with TNF-a,\nIjB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and rapidly degraded via\n26S proteasome, which results in the release of NF-jB. Therefore,\nthe effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced phosphorylation and\ndegradation of IjBa was examined using Western blotting. Aucu-\nbin significantly reduced the TNF-a-induced IjBa phosphorylation\nin a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, aucubin pretreatment\nblocked TNF-a-induced IjBa degradation (Fig. 4A). Next, the ef-\nfects of ERK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059 (PD) on TNF-a-induced\nIjBa phosphorylation and degradation were investigated. In paral-\nlel with the effects of aucubin, pretreatment with 20 lM PD98059\nreduced the TNF-a-induced IjBa phosphorylation and degradation\nin adipocytes (Fig. 4A). These observations suggest that the phos-\nphorylation and degradation of IjBa is affected by ERK1/2 signal\npathway. In fact, it has been known that activation of IjBa degra-\ndation is a downstream event following the activation of the ERK1/\n2 pathway [24]. Thus, it was investigated whether aucubin regu-\nlates the phosphorylation of ERK using Western blotting. Challenge\nwith TNF-a brought about the ERK phosphorylation within 15 min;\nthen p-ERK band was gradually restored to basal level (Fig. 4B).\nTherefore, Western blotting for ERK was carried out after treating\nwith TNF-a (10 ng/mL) for 15 min in the presence or absence of\naucubin. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with aucubin in the\nindicated concentrations for 6 h and then stimulated with TNF-a\n(10 ng/mL) for 15 min. Total cell lysates were then probed with\nphosphospecific antibodies for ERK1/2. The phosphorylation of\nERK1/2 was increased in cells treated with TNF-a alone. However,\naucubin significantly inhibited phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in\nTNF-a-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a concentration-dependent\nmanner (Fig. 4C).\n4. Discussions\n\nAucubin [1,4a,5,7a-tetra-5-hydroxy-7-(hydroxymethyl)cyclo-\npenta(c)pyran-1-yl-b-D-glucopyranoside] is a common iridoid gly-\ncoside, found in a wide range of plants, which are used in folk\nmedicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Those medicinal plants\ncontaining aucubin show a variety of biological activities as afore-\nmentioned. Of pharmaceutical products as well as dietary supple-\nments containing such medicinal plant materials, agents for\ntreating inflammatory ailments including rheumatic inflammation\nhave been marketed and used for long time. As for the molecular\nmechanism for anti-inflammatory activities of aucubin, it was re-\nported that aucubin inhibits the production of TNF-a resulting\nfrom the both IjBa degradation and the nuclear translocation of\nNF-jB in RAW 264.7 cells [21].\n\nIt was previously reported that the increased levels of TNF-a\nassociated with obesity may significantly contribute to elevated\nplasma and adipose tissue expression levels of adipokines [25].\nThis study demonstrated that aucubin effectively inhibited TNF-\na-stimulated increases in the secretion of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6\nin 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1). The mRNA production of each adipo-\nkines was suppressed in parallel with its secretion regulated by\naucubin (Fig. 2).\n\nTranscription factor NF-jB has been evidenced to play a major\nrole in the TNF-a-induced expression of adipokines in adipocytes\n[26]. NF-jB is associated and controlled by IjBa, which presents\nan inactive form in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, IjBa be-\ncomes phosphorylated, undergoes degradation, and allows NF-jB\ntranslocation into the nucleus, where it activates proinflammatory\ngenes and participates in the inflammatory response [27]. In the\npresent study, aucubin suppressed the nuclear translocation of\nNF-jB (Fig. 3), which suggests that aucubin may decrease NF-jB\nactivity by inhibition of IjBa degradation. Furthermore, it revealed\nthat ERK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059 blocked degradation of\nIjBa upon TNF-a stimulation, implying that IjBa degradation is\na downstream event following the activation of the ERK1/2 path-\nway (Fig. 4A). Therefore, to confirm the inhibitory mechanisms of\nIjBa degradation by aucubin, the effects of aucubin on TNF-a-in-\nduced ERK phosphorylation were investigated. It was found that\naucubin exhibited significant inhibition on TNF-a-stimulated\nERK1/2 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent fashion\n(Fig. 4C).\n\nIn conclusion, aucubin can attenuate TNF-a-stimulated in-\ncreases in gene expression and secretion of adipokines in 3T3-L1\nadipocytes. The effects of aucubin were mediated by suppression\nof ERK phosphorylation, IjBa degradation, and subsequent NF-\njB activation. The present study may contribute to the under-\nstanding of anti-inflammatory effects of aucubin and provide a no-\nvel mechanism of aucubin in preventing obesity-related\npathologies.\nReferences\n\n[1] Douketis JD, Sharma AM.
