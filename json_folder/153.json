This work studies the effect of the cytokine on electrolyte and water movements in the rat distal colon using an intestinal\nperfusion technique and attempts to determine its underlying mechanism of action. TNF-a inhibited net water and chloride\nabsorption, down-regulated in both surface and crypt colonocytes the Na\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter, and reduced the protein\nexpression and activity of the Na\n\nCeKC ATPase. Indomethacin up-regulated the pump and the cotransporter in surface cells but\nnot in crypt cells, and in its presence, TNF-a could not exert its effect, suggesting an involvement of PGE2 in the cytokine action.\nThe effect of TNF-a on the pump and symporter was studied also in cultured Caco-2 cells in isolation of the effect of other cells and\ntissues, to test whether the cytokine acts directly on intestinal cells. In these cells, TNF-a and PGE2 had a similar effect on the pump\nexpression and activity as that observed in crypt cells but were without any effect on the Na\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter. It was\nconcluded that the effect of the cytokine on colonocytes is mediated via PGE2. By inhibiting the Na\n\nCeKC ATPase, it reduces the\nNa\n\nC\ngradient needed for NaCl absorption, and by down-regulating the expression of the Na\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd symporter, it reduces\nbasolateral Cl\n\n\ufffd\nentry and luminal Cl\n\n\ufffd\nsecretion. The inhibitory effect on absorption is more significant than the inhibitory effect on\n\nsecretion resulting in a decrease in net electrolyte uptake and consequently in more water retention in the lumen.\n\ufffd 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nThere is increasing evidence nowadays that multiple\nand complex interactions exist between inflammatory\nmediators and disturbances in ion transport processes\nthat occur in bacterial, parasitic and autoimmune\ninflammatory diseases of the large intestine [1e3].\nToday, three cytokines are known to be implicated in\nbowel inflammation namely interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor\nnecrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6 [4]. Inflammatory bowel\ndiseases (IBD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory\n\n) Corresponding author. Fax: C961 1 744461.\nE-mail address: sawkreyd@aub.edu.lb (S.I.

They include two\nmain entities: Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis\n(UC), and are characterized by chronic inflammation of\nthe digestive tract with a prominent infiltration of affected\ntissues by lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, and\nmast cells [4]. Increased levels of the pro-inflammatory\ncytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a have been\ndetected in IBD, and TNF-a is believed to play a pivotal\nrole in its pathogenesis. The cytokine\u2019s level was\nelevated in mononuclear cells of the lamina propria\nisolated from patients inflicted with the disease and its\nadministration for 10 days produced chronic inflamma-\ntion of the intestinal lamina propria and submucosa [5].\nTNF-a caused also a 640-fold increase in the median\n\nmailto:sawkreyd@aub.edu.lb\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n320 S. Markossian, S.I. Kreydiyyeh / Cytokine 30 (2005) 319e327\nserum concentration in patients with UC as compared\nto healthy donors [6].\n\nAlthough the increase in the level of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines has been well established, its correlation with\nthe disease symptoms, mainly diarrhea and disturbed\nelectrolyte and water movements, has not been well\ndocumented.\n\nDiarrhea results from a decrease in net water\nabsorption. Changes in water transport across the colon\nepithelium follow changes in net Na movements [7]. The\nmammalian colon absorbs sodium and chloride, and\nsecretes potassium, bicarbonate, and chloride [8,9].\nUnder control conditions net absorption prevails [10],\nwhile secretory activities become apparent only upon\nstimulation by secretagogues [11].\n\nNa\nC\n\nabsorption can be electrogenic via Na\nC\n\nchannels ENaC and is confined to the surface epithelium\nand upper part of the crypt [12] or electroneutral via\nparallel Na\n\nC\n/H\n\nC\nand Cl\n\n\ufffd\n/HCO3\n\n\ufffd\nexchange and is\n\npresent in both crypts and surface epithelium [13,14].\nIn the rat and mouse colon, neutral NaCl absorption is\ndominant and is driven by the Na\n\nC\ngradient established\n\nby the Na\nCeKC pump.\n\nSecretion of Cl\n\ufffd\n\nand K\nC\n\noccurs through their\nrespective channels present on the luminal side and is\nalso geared indirectly by the Na\n\nCeKC pump, since it is\ndependent on the activity of the Na\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd\n\nsymporter which is itself energized by the Na\nC\n\ngradient\nestablished by the ATPase.\n\nAlthough secretion is commonly believed to be\nrestricted to crypt colonocytes, recent studies have\nshown that electrolyte secretion can occur in both\nsurface and crypt epithelia [9,12].\n\nSince the Na\nCeKC ATPase is a major regulator of\n\nthe transporters responsible for absorptive and secretory\nprocesses, any change in its activity is expected to lead to\nchanges in net Na\n\nC\nand consequently water movements.\n\nAn increase in electrolyte secretion and a decrease in\nelectrolyte absorption have been reported in inflamma-\ntory bowel diseases [15,16] together with elevated levels\nof TNF-a. Whether the cytokine is responsible for the\nobserved diarrhea and targets the Na\n\nCeKC pump has\nnot been clearly elucidated. The aim of this work is to\nstudy the effect of TNF-a on net water and chloride\nmovements in the rat colon, and determine its mecha-\nnism of action by studying its effects on the Na\n\nCeKC\n\npump and the Na\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter.\n\n2. Methods\n\nMale SpragueeDawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) weigh-\ning 150e200 g were used and handled all through in\naccordance with the Guide for Laboratory Animal\nFacilities and Care, US Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare.\nAll chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Sigma\nChemical Co., St Louis, MP, USA). Recombinant\nHuman TNF alpha was purchased from Endogen,\nMA, USA.\n\nRabbit anti-Na\nCeKC ATPase a1 polyclonal anti-\n\nbody and anti-rabbit IgG HPR conjugated antibody\nwere purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, NY, USA.\nThe expression of the a1 catalytic subunit was studied\nbecause it is the main isoform present in the intestine\n[17]. Rabbit anti-rat Na\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter\nantibody was obtained from Alpha Diagnostic In-\nternational, TX, USA.\n\nThe human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) was\na generous gift from Dr. Mark Donowitz from Johns\nHopkins University, USA.\n\n2.1. Effect of TNF-a on net water and chloride\nmovements in the rat colon\n\nRats were injected i.p. with different doses of TNF-\na (100, 170 or 200 ng/100 gBW) 4 h prior to the beginning\nof the experiment. The doses and time point have been\nselected based on a previous work with IL-1b [18]. When\nthe effect of indomethacin was studied, it was injected i.p.\n(1 mg/100 g BW) 10 min before TNF-a. TNF-a was\nadministered in physiological saline while indomethacin\nwas dissolved in DMSO (3 mg/100 ml) and then added to\nphosphate buffer (0.088 M NaCl; 0.01 M Na2HPO4;\n8 mM KH2PO4 pH 7.3) to a final concentration of\n4 mg/ml. Control rats received a similar volume of the\ndifferent vehicles.\n\nAt the time of the experiment rats were anesthetized\nby i.p. injection of pentobarbital (5 mg/100 g BW) and\ntheir abdomen opened through a midline incision. A\nsegment of the distal colon was isolated, making sure to\nkeep the mesenteries and vasculature intact, and was\nperfused for 15 min with Krebs-improved Ringer buffer\n(KIRB) (123.3 mM NaCl; 6.17 mM KCl; 3.29 mM\nCaCl2$7H2O; 0.78 mM MgSO4$7H2O; 32.14 mM NaH-\nCO3; 1.54 mM KH2PO4; 6.4 mM sodium pyruvate;\n6.4 mM sodium glutamate; 7 mM sodium fumarate;\n11.1 mM glucose) at a rate of 0.7 ml/min to clear it from\nwastes. In a second step the colon was perfused with the\nsame buffer and at the same rate for 30 min, but the\neffluent was collected and its volume measured. Buffers\nwere oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) at 37\n\n\ufffdC and then\ntheir pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl or NaOH.\n\nAt the end of the second perfusion, the perfused\nsegment was excised, cut longitudinally, its width and\nlength measured and its surface area determined. Water\nmovements during the second 30-min perfusion step\nwere calculated as the difference in volume between the\ninfused and collected buffers divided by the surface area\nof the perfused colon.\n\nChloride was measured by titration according to\nMohr\u2019s method [19] and net chloride absorption was\n\n\n\n321S. Markossian, S.I. Kreydiyyeh / Cytokine 30 (2005) 319e327\ncalculated as the difference between the total number of\nmoles present in the infused and collected buffers,\ndivided by the area of the colon perfused.\n\n2.2. PGE2 involvement\n\nTo study the involvement of PGE2 in the response to\nTNF-a, indomethacin was used as an inhibitor of COX-\nenzymes which inhibits both COX-1, the constitutive\nenzyme and COX-2 the cytokine-inducible isozyme, and\nis not specific to any one of them. Indomethacin (10 mg/\nkg BW) was injected i.p. 10 min before the injection of\nTNF-a.\n\n2.3. Preparation of crude membranes from colonic\nsurface and crypt cells\n\nSurface and crypt cells were isolated from the colon\nand characterized as described by Homaidan et al. [20].\nThe isolated cells were re-suspended in a Tris buffer\n(buffer A) (200 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2$6H2O; 2 mM\nEGTA; 5 mM KCl; 200 mM TriseHCl, pH 7.4), and\nhomogenized in a glasseTeflon homogenizer with 20\nstrokes at 2100 rpm (Arthur Thomas Scientific Appa-\nratus, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and then spun for 10 min\nat 1000g and 4 \ufffdC. A crude membrane fraction was then\nprepared by centrifuging the supernatant collected for\n10 min at 33,000g, and was saved after the addition of\nprotease inhibitors to assay later on for the Na\n\nC\neK\n\nC\n\nATPase activity and determine the protein expression of\nthe pump and the Na\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter as\ndescribed below. All steps in the preparation of the\nhomogenate were conducted at 4 \ufffdC. The percent\nrecovery of the Na\n\nCeKC ATPase activity in the crude\nmembrane homogenate for both surface and crypt\nranged between 84 and 92% while the percent recovery\nof the cotransporter, determined by western blot\nanalysis ranged between 79 and 88%.\n\n2.4. Culture and treatment of Caco-2 cells\n\nCaco-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Minimal\nEssential Medium (DMEM) containing 4500 mg/L\nGlucose and supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum,\nPenicillin (100 mg/ml) and Streptomycin (100 mg/ml), in\na humidified incubator (95% air, 5% CO2) at 37\n\n\ufffdC.\nThe cells were treated when 80% confluent for\n\ndifferent time periods with different concentrations of\nTNF-a to determine the optimal dose and incubation\nperiod. When the effect of indomethacin or PGE2 was\nstudied they were added at a respective concentration of\n100 mM and 1 nM (chosen based on a previous work\nconducted on Caco-2 cells and LLC-PK1 [21,22] and\nwere dissolved, respectively, in DMSO and ethanol.\nIndomethacin was added 15 min prior to TNF-a.

Net chloride absorption was also\ndecreased at 170 and 300 ng/100 g BW (Fig. 1b).\n\nSince the maximal inhibitory effects of the cytokine\nappeared at 170 ng/100 g BW, this dose was considered\noptimal and was used later on in all subsequent\nexperiments.\n\n3.2. Involvement of PGE2\n\nTo see whether the effect of TNF-a is mediated via\nPGE2 production, the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes\nwere inhibited with indomethacin (1 mg/100 g BW),\ninjected 10 min before TNF-a. Indomethacin alone did\nnot have any effect on net water or chloride absorption\nbut abrogated completely that of TNF-a (Fig. 2a and b).\n\n3.3. Effect of TNF-a on the protein expression of\nthe Na\n\nCeKC ATPase in colon surface and crypt\ncells isolated from treated rats\n\nTNF-a down-regulated the protein expression of the\nalpha-1 subunit of the Na\n\nCeKC pump in colonic\nsurface and crypt cells isolated from animals treated\nwith the cytokine (170 ng TNF-a/100 g BW for 4 h), as\nillustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. Indomethacin alone up-\nregulated the pump in surface cells but did not have any\neffect in crypt colonocytes.

Effect of TNF-a on the activity of the\nNa\n\nCeKC ATPase in colon surface and\ncrypt cells isolated from treated rats\n\nIn parallel to the protein expression, TNF-a (170 ng/\n100 g BW) inhibited significantly the activity of the\nNa\n\nCeKCATPase in surface and crypt cells isolated\nfrom treated animals, by 87 and 92%, respectively\n(Fig. 5). Pre-treatment with indomethacin, led to 100%\nrecovery of the enzymatic activity in both types of cells,\nabrogating thus the effect of TNF-a (Fig. 5) and\nsuggesting that the cytokine exerts its effect through\nPGE2.\n\n3.5. Effect of TNF-a on the protein expression\nof the Na\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter in surface\nand crypt colonocytes isolated from treated rats\n\nBecause the diarrhea that accompanies elevated levels\nof TNF-a in IBD may result from increased water\nsecretion, and since the Na\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd symporter\nis involved in secretory processes, we opted to study\nthe effect of TNF-a on the protein expression of the\ncotransporter. In both surface and crypt cells, the\ncytokine down-regulated the cotransporter (Fig. 6).\nIndomethacin, on the other hand caused an up-\nregulation in surface cells (around 12-folds), and in its\npresence the effect of TNF-a did not appear neither in\nsurface nor in crypt cells.\n\n3.6. Time and dose dependent effect of TNF-a\non the expression of a1 subunit of the Na\n\nCeKC\n\nATPase in Caco-2 cells\n\nTNF-a reduced in a dose and time dependent\nmanner, the protein expression of the alpha-1 subunit\nof the Na\n\nCeKC ATPase in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 7). The\ninhibition was more prominent at 2 h than 3 or 4 h. At\n10 ng/ml and 2 h the expression of the Na\n\nC\npump was\n\nalmost totally inhibited (Fig. 7).\n3.7.

Discussion\n\nThis work demonstrated a decrease in net water and\nchloride absorption from the colon of rats injected with\nTNF-a (Fig. 2a and b) which could be due to either\na decrease in absorption or an increase in secretion\n[11,24] or both. Water movements are geared by the\nosmotic gradient that results from the different distri-\nbution of electrolytes across the plasma membrane,\nmainly Na\n\nC\n.\n\nAbsorption of NaCl in the rat distal colon is mainly\nelectroneutral [25] via parallel Na\n\nC\n/H\n\nC\nand Cl\n\n\ufffd\n/HCO3\n\n\ufffd\n\nexchange. The driving force for this transport process\nderives from the Na\n\nC\ngradient established by the Na\n\nCe\nK\n\nC\npump. Since the activity and protein expression\n\nof the Na\nCeKC ATPase were reduced in both surface\n\nand crypt colonocytes isolated from rats treated with\nTNF-a (Figs. 3e5), the pump seems to be a direct site\nof action for the cytokine, causing a decrease in the\nNa\n\nC\ngradient and net NaCl absorption, and conse-\n\nquently, a decrease in water uptake which usually\nfollows electrolyte movements by osmosis.\n\nIt has been recently demonstrated that secretion can\noccur in both surface and crypt epithelia [26] and\ninvolves the Na\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter and the\nNa\n\nCeKC ATPase situated both on the basolateral side.\nChloride, sodium and potassium ions are taken up by\nthe cotransporter from the serosal fluid using the Na\n\nC\n\ngradient established by the pump.

This leads to hyperpolariza-\ntion of the epithelial cells and an electrochemical\ngradient that favors Cl\n\n\ufffd\nsecretion into the lumen, and\n\nwater follows osmotically [27]. This work has demon-\nstrated a decrease in the protein expression of the Na\n\nC\ne\n\nK\nCe2Cl\ufffd symporter in both surface and crypt cells\n\n(Fig. 6). Down-regulation of the cotransporter is\nexpected to decrease basolateral Cl\n\n\ufffd\nentry and Cl\n\n\ufffd\n\nsecretion.\nA possible involvement of PGE2 in the action of\n\nTNF-a was previously suspected in the colon [28]. To\nsee whether the effect of TNF-a on water and chloride\nabsorption is mediated via PGE2, indomethacin was\nused as an inhibitor of PGE2 synthesis.\n\nIn surface cells the protein expression of the Na\nCeKC\n\nATPase and the Na\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd symporter was up-\n\nregulated by indomethacin (Figs. 3 and 6) and in its\npresence the effect of TNF-a on the two transporters did\nnot appear. These results suggest that PGE2 is involved\nin the regulation of the basal expression of both\ntransporters and is indeed a mediator of TNF-a action.\nUp-regulation of the pump in presence of indomethacin\nwas not accompanied by an increase in its activity (Figs.\n3 and 5) suggesting that basal levels of PGE2 increase\nthe number of the ATPase molecules but reduce their\nactivity. Changes in the activity of the pump may be due\nto its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation [29] by some\nTNF-a-activated kinases/phosphatases like p38 MAPK\nand Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).\n\nIn crypt cells, indomethacin had no effect on the\nprotein expressionof both transporters but still abrogated\n\nNa+/K+/2Cl-\n\n\u03b2 actin\n\nControl PGE2 \n\nFig. 13. Effect of PGE2 on the protein expression of the Na\nCeKC\n\nATPase in Caco-2 cells. Results are representative of an experiment\n\nthree times.\nthe effect of TNF-a (Figs. 4 and 6c), inferring that PGE2 is\nnot involved in regulating the basal level of the two\ntransporters but is mediating only the induced down-\nregulatory effect of TNF-a.\n\nIn both cells, the effect of TNF-a on Na\nC\neK\n\nC\n\nATPase activity was more prominent than its effect on\nits protein expression and can be ascribed to a decrease\nin both the number and activity of pump molecules.\n\nIn crypt cells the cotransporter was expressed at\nhigher density (Fig. 6a and c), probably due to the\nknown greater role of crypt cells in secretion than\nsurface cells [30].\n\nIt can be postulated that TNF-a decreases in vivo\nboth Na\n\nC\nand Cl\n\n\ufffd\nabsorption resulting in a net decrease\n\nin electrolyte uptake that causes changes in the osmotic\ngradient favoring more water retention in the colon.\n\nAn inflammatory response is the result of a cytokine\ncascade,where one cytokine leads to the release of another\nuntil the final response is elicited. Thus TNF-a injected to\nanimals may have exerted its effect on the colonocytes\ndirectly or indirectly by acting on other target cells and\ncausing the release of other cytokines or inflammatory\nmediators that could act in an autocrine, parcrine or\nendocrine way. To clarify this point Caco-2 cells derived\nfrom a human colon carcinoma cell line were cultured\nand grown in isolation from any other tissues, and\ntreated with TNF-a. These cells have been shown to\nretain cellular polarity, exhibit vectorial ion transport,\nform intercellular tight junction, and respond to\nhormones and neurotransmitters [31,32]. A Cl\n\n\ufffd\nsecre-\n\ntory response, although lower in intensity than the one\nobserved in T84 or HT-19 cell lines, was elicited in these\ncells by many secretagogues (cAMP, VIP, epineph-\nrine.) [32].\n\nTNF-a reduced in Caco-2 cells also, the activity and\nprotein expression of the Na\n\nCeKC pump (Figs. 7 and 8),\nwhich is consistent with our previous in vivo results.\nIndomethacin alone had no effect on the ATPase but\nabrogated the effect of TNF-a (Figs. 9 and 10). Since\nCaco-2 cells are known to possess crypt cell properties\n[31], the effect of indomethacin on the pump was similar\nto that observed in crypt cells isolated from animals\ntreated in vivo with the cytokine.\n\n\n\n327S. Markossian, S.I. Kreydiyyeh / Cytokine 30 (2005) 319e327\nTNF-a had no effects on the protein expression of the\nNa\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter in Caco-2 cells in\npresence or absence of indomethacin (Fig. 11) while it\nreduced it significantly in crypt cells isolated from\ntreated animals. Since the observed in vivo effect\ndisappeared in presence of indomethacin it is speculated\nto be due to PGE2 produced by neighboring cells and\nacting in a paracrine way.\n\nThe involvement of PGE2 in TNF-a action was\nconfirmed by the direct addition of exogenous PGE2 to\nCaco-2 cells. PGE2 caused as TNF-a, a decrease in the\npump activity and expression (Fig. 12) but had no effect\non the Na\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotransporter (Fig. 13).\nIt can be concluded that TNF-a decreases electrolyte\n\nabsorption by inhibiting the Na\nCeKC pump, and\n\nreduces electrolyte secretion by down-regulating the\nNa\n\nCeKCe2Cl\ufffd cotranporter. The latter step may\ncome as a regulatory measure to counteract the reduced\nabsorption. The effect on absorption is probably more\nprominent than the effect on secretion resulting in the\nobserved decrease in net Cl\n\n\ufffd\nand water uptake. The\n\neffect on the two transporters is mediated through\nPGE2.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the\nUniversity Research Board.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Lauritsen K, Laursen LS, Bukhave K, Rask-Madsen.
