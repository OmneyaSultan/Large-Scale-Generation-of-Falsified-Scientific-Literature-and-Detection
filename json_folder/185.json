Roberts\n\n1,3\n& Jean J. Zhao\n\n1,3,5\n\nOn activation by receptors, the ubiquitously expressed class IA\nisoforms (p110a and p110b) of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase\n(PI(3)K) generate lipid secondmessengers, which initiatemultiple\nsignal transduction cascades1\u20135. Recent studies have demonstrated\nspecific functions for p110a in growth factor and insulin\nsignalling6\u20138. To probe for distinct functions of p110b, we con-\nstructed conditional knockout mice. Here we show that ablation\nof p110b in the livers of the resulting mice leads to impaired insu-\nlin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, while having little effect\non phosphorylation of Akt, suggesting the involvement of a\nkinase-independent role of p110b in insulin metabolic action.\nUsing established mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that\nremoval of p110b also had little effect on Akt phosphorylation in\nresponse to stimulation by insulin and epidermal growth factor,\nbut resulted in retarded cell proliferation. Reconstitution of\np110b-null cells with a wild-type or kinase-dead allele of p110b\ndemonstrated that p110b possesses kinase-independent functions\nin regulating cell proliferation and trafficking. However, the\nkinase activity of p110bwas required for G-protein-coupled recep-\ntor signalling triggered by lysophosphatidic acid and had a func-\ntion in oncogenic transformation. Most strikingly, in an animal\nmodel of prostate tumour formation induced by Pten loss, abla-\ntion of p110b (also known as Pik3cb), but not that of p110a (also\nknown as Pik3ca), impeded tumorigenesis with a concomitant\ndiminution of Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings\ndemonstrate both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent\nfunctions for p110b, and strongly indicate the kinase-dependent\nfunctions of p110b as a promising target in cancer therapy.\n\nClass IA PI(3)Ks are heterodimeric lipid kinases consisting of a\np110 catalytic subunit complexed to one of several regulatory sub-\nunits, collectively called p85 (refs 4, 5). In response to stimulation by\ngrowth factor, p110 subunits catalyse the production of the\nlipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate\n(PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) at themembrane\n\n1\u20134. This secondmessenger in turn\nactivates the serine/threonine kinase Akt and other downstream\neffectors9,10. Knockout mice for either p110a or p110b die early in\nembryonic development11,12. However, recent studies using con-\nditional knockout strategies8 and isoform-specific small molecule\ninhibitors7 showed that p110a is important in growth-factor signal-\nling, whereas a kinase-inactive knock-in mouse model showed that\ninsulin responses depended on the catalytic activity of p110a (ref. 6).\n\nTo investigate the role(s) of p110b in cell, tissue and organismal\nphysiology and to examine it as a potential therapeutic target in can-\ncer, we generated mice carrying a conditional Pik3cb allele\n(Supplementary Fig. 1). We first investigated the role of p110b in\ninsulin action. Because liver is the major insulin-responsive organ,\n\nwe examined the effects of p110b loss on hepatic insulin function.\nTo achieve liver-specific deletion of p110b, we injected the tail veins of\np110b\n\nflox/flox\nmicewith adenoviruses expressingb-galactosidase (Ade-\n\nLacZ) or Cre recombinase (Ade-Cre) to generate matched cohorts of\ncontrol mice and mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of p110b.\nAdditional cohorts of wild-type animals were subjected to Ade-Cre\nor Ade-LacZ, allowing us to rule out potential non-specific Cre effects\n(data not shown). A more than 90% decrease in p110b protein was\nseen in the livers of Ade-Cre-injectedmice, whereas p110b expression\nremained unchanged in the livers of the control mice and muscle\ntissues from both groups as measured by western blotting\n(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Consistent with previous findings6,7 that\nthe kinase activity of p110b has only a minor function in insulin\nsignalling, we saw no significant change in Akt phosphorylation in\nresponse to insulin challenge in livers lacking p110b (Supplementary\nFig. 2a). However,mice deficient in hepatic p110b had higher levels of\ninsulin in the blood than control animals when fasted (Fig. 1a). These\nanimals also showed a lower tolerance of glucose and sensitivity to\ninsulin on challenge by intraperitoneal injection of glucose or insulin\n(Fig. 1b, c). Mice deficient in hepatic p110b produced more glucose\nthan control animals did in a pyruvate challenge test (Fig. 1d). An\nanalysis of lipogenesis showed no significant changes in serum tri-\nglycerides, fatty acids and cholesterol levels when p110b was deleted\nfrom liver (Supplementary Fig. 3), but leptin levels were elevated\ncompared with those in control animals, as was seen in p110a\nkinase-dead knock-in animals6 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Of a panel\nof gluconeogenic genes, only that encoding phosphoenolpyruvate\ncarboxykinase (PEPCK) was increased in p110b-deficient livers\n(Supplementary Fig. 4). PEPCK promotes the production and syn-\nthesis of glucose in liver, resulting in a greater release of glucose into\nblood. This result therefore provides at least a partial explanation for\nthe metabolic phenotypes observed. Although these findings indicate\nthat p110b might contribute to metabolic regulation through a\nkinase-independent mechanism, we cannot rule out the involvement\nof the catalytic role of p110b in insulin responses. Our observations\nare in linewith earlier work7 inwhich a p110b-specific small-molecule\ninhibitor was used to demonstrate that acute blockage of the kinase\nactivity of p110b had little effect on insulin action. In addition,\nanother study13 found that mice doubly heterozygous for knockout\nof p110a and p110b showed decreased sensitivity to insulin with no\napparent changes in Akt phosphorylation.\n\nTo obtain cells for detailed signalling studies, mouse embryonic\nfibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from floxed embryos and their wild-\ntype littermates, as described in Supplementary Information\n(Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013c). MEFs lacking p110b proliferated signifi-\ncantly more slowly than parental (p110b\n\nflox/flox\n) or wild-type\n\n1\nDepartment of Cancer Biology and\n\n2\nDepartment ofMedical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston,Massachusetts 02115, USA.\n\n3\nDepartment of Pathology and\n\n4\nDepartment\n\nof Pathology and 5Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\n\nVol 454 |7 August 2008 |doi:10.1038/nature07091\n\n776\n\n \u00a92008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To obtain a second, more easily\nrenewed supply of knockout cells, we established immortalized\np110b\n\nflox/flox\nand p110b\n\n1/1\nMEFs by means of infection with a retro-\n\nvirus encoding a dominant-negative form of p53 (DNp53)14.We also\ngenerated an add-back line by introducing haemagglutinin (HA)-\ntagged human p110b to DNp53-immortalized p110b\n\nflox/flox\nMEFs.\n\nThese immortalized MEFs were then treated with Ade-Cre to yield\nthe following MEF lines: bKO (from p110b\n\nflox/flox\n) and bKO1b\n\n(from the add-back). For wild-type control MEFs, designated WT,\nwe used DNp53-immortalized p110b\n\nflox/flox\ncells without Cre treat-\n\nment interchangeably with Cre-treated DNp53-immortalized\np110b\n\n1/1\nMEFs, because no significant differences were ever seen\n\nbetween these two possible controls. Deletion of p110b had no obvi-\nous negative effect on the phosphorylation of Akt in either primary\nMEFs or DNp53-immortalized MEFs in response to stimulation by\ninsulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth\nfactor (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6a\u2013c). However, a moderate\ndiminution in the phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein\n(S6RP) at Ser 235/Ser 236 was detected in these bKO cells in response\nto insulin or serum (Supplementary Fig. 7). Previous studies have\nimplicated p110b in signalling elicited by G-protein-coupled recep-\ntors (GPCRs)15,16. We found consistently that both phospho-Akt and\nphospho-S6RP levels were decreased in response to lysophosphatidic\nacid (LPA) in cells lacking p110b (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig.\n8a).\n\nTo dissect the potential kinase-dependent and kinase-independent\nroles of p110b, we reconstituted bKO MEFs with a kinase-inactive\nallele of HA-tagged human p110b, using the previously reported\nK805R mutation (KR)17 to generate the bKO1KR MEF line.\nThough the expression of KR was lower than that of the WT add-\nback construct, it was expressed at a level slightly higher than endo-\ngenous p110b, and expression levels of p110a were unchanged\n(Supplementary Fig. 9a, and data not shown). Loss of lipid kinase\nactivity in the KR cells was confirmed by lipid kinase assay8,18 after\nimmunoprecipitation with anti-p110b (Supplementary Fig. 9b). We\n\nthen examined the effect of WT or KR add-back on the altered sig-\nnalling seen after the loss of p110b. The decrease in both phospho-\nAkt and phospho-S6RP in response to stimulation with LPA\nobserved in bKO cells was restored by adding back WT but not the\nKR allele of p110b (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 8b), suggesting a\ncatalytic function for p110b in LPA signalling. This seems to be\nunique to p110b, because loss of p110a has no obvious effect on\nLPA signalling (Fig. 2e). The lower phospho-S6RP levels in bKO cells\nwere restored by bothWTandKR add-backs in response to insulin or\nfetal bovine serum (FBS) (Supplementary Fig. 7, and data not\nshown), suggesting a scaffolding role of p110b in signalling by insulin\nand growth factors. However, ourMEF data do not rule out a role for\np110b in classical signalling by PI(3)K in other circumstances. For\ninstance, when we ablated p110a in our earlier work, residual phos-\nphorylation by Akt was observed in response to growth factors8.\nBecause MEFs express p110a and p110b and not other class I\nPI(3)Ks, this residual signal was presumably transduced by p110b.\nWe also note that p110b ablation removes the protein as a competitor\nfor p110a on receptors, which may allow any decrease in signalling\ncaused by p110b loss to be masked or compensated for by an\nincreased signal flux through p110a.\n\nTo test the kinase-dependent and/or kinase-independent effects of\np110b on cell proliferation, we studied cell cycle kinetics by first\nsynchronizing cells by serum starvation and then measuring the pro-\nportion of cells in S phase with the incorporation of bromodeoxyur-\nidine (BrdU) after re-feeding. Whereas bKO cells had a delayed peak\nof BrdU incorporation, KR reconstituted cells showed a similar\nincorporation of BrdU to that of WT and bKO1b cells (Fig. 2f).\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nS\ne\nru\n\nm\n in\n\nsu\nlin\n\n (\nn\ng\n\n m\nl\u2013\n\n1\n)\n\n\u03b2KO\nn = 6\n\nWT\nn = 7\n\n*\n\na\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n0 30 60 90 120\nTime (min)\n\nB\nlo\n\no\nd\n\n g\nlu\n\nc\no\n\nse\n (\nm\n\ng\n d\n\nl\u2013\n1\n)\n\nWT, n = 11\n\u03b2KO, n = 6\n\n**\n**\n\n**\n\n***\n\nb\n\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n0 15 30 45 60\nTime (min) Time (min)\n\nB\nlo\n\no\nd\n\n g\nlu\n\nc\no\n\nse\n (\n%\n\n o\nf \n\nb\na\nsa\n\nl)\n\n***\n\nc\n\nWT, n = 9\n\u03b2KO, n = 6\n\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\n0 30 60 90 120\n\nB\nlo\n\no\nd\n\n g\nlu\n\nc\no\n\nse\n (\nm\n\ng\n d\n\nl\u2013\n1\n)\n\n**\n*\n\n**\n\nd\n\nWT, n = 7\n\u03b2KO, n = 6\n\n**\n\nFigure 1 | Mice with liver-specific deletion of p110b show resistance to\ninsulin and intolerance of glucose.

Although there is ample published evidence indi-\ncating the importance of transferrin uptake for the growth of a variety\nof cell types20, it is not clear whether the defect in transferrin uptake is\na primary cause of the growth defect observed here.\n\nClass IA PI(3)Ks have been clearly implicated in cancer21\u201324, with\nmuch recent work delineating the role of p110a in cancer25\u201327. To\nstudy a potential role of p110b in oncogenic transformation, we\nperformed focus formation assays by infecting monolayers of\nDNp53-immortalized MEFs with retroviruses expressing various\noncogenes. Oncogenic HRas-G12V and EGFR-Del (DL747\u2013E749,\nA750P) retroviruses efficiently raised foci in WT cells but failed to\ntransform bKO MEFs (Fig. 3a). The decreases in foci seen in bKO\nMEFs were actually more pronounced than those seen in p110a KO\nMEFs (Supplementary Fig. 10). Transformation was fully restored in\n\nbKO1b cells but partly restored in bKO1KR cells (Fig. 3a), suggest-\ning that both the kinase activity and kinase-independent functions of\np110b may have a function in oncogene-induced transformation.\n\nPTEN, a lipid phosphatase, functions to oppose class IA PI(3)K\nkinase activity. Loss of Pten expression is a common event in many\nsolid tumours28. The key challenge is to identify which p110 isoform\u2019s\ncatalytic activity is unshackled by Pten loss in any given tumour. To\ntest for a role of p110b in tumorigenesis driven by Pten loss, we\ngenerated mice that carried the Pten\n\nflox/flox\n(ref. 29) and p110b\n\nflox/flox\n\nalleles, as well as a probasin-driven Cre transgene30, to specifically\ndelete Pten and p110b in prostatic epithelium. Prostates had a normal\nappearance in the absence of p110b (Fig. 3b, c). Prostate tissue lack-\ning Pten expression showed universal high-grade prostatic intra-\nepithelial neoplasia in the anterior lobe by 12 weeks. Ablation of\np110b blocked the tumorigenesis caused by Pten loss in the anterior\nprostate (Table 1 and Fig. 3b, c). The loss of Pten was confirmed by\ngenomic DNA analysis after laser-capture-assisted microdissection\nof single epithelial layers and bywestern blotting (Supplementary Fig.\n11, and data not shown). Whereas Cre-mediated loss of Pten effi-\nciently activated Akt in the prostate as judged by its phosphorylation\non Ser 473, additional ablation of p110b diminished the phospho-\nAkt levels (Fig. 3b), suggesting that p110b catalytic activity contri-\nbutes to tumorigenesis. More surprisingly, when we performed the\nsame set of experiments using p110a ablation, we saw no changes\neither in tumour formation or in Akt phosphorylation (Table 1 and\nFig. 3b, c). Again, the complete excision of p110a in tumour tissues\nwas confirmed by multiple measures (Supplementary Fig. 12, and\ndata not shown). It has been suggested that p110a and p110b gen-\nerate distinct pools of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (ref. 7). In response to insulin\nor other stimuli, an acute flux of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is produced largely\nby p110a and is efficiently coupled to Akt phosphorylation. In con-\ntrast, p110b has been proposed to generate a basal level of\nPtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with little effect on Akt phosphorylation\n\n7. It was\nshown that Akt phophorylation induced by Pten loss in vitro was\nsensitive to p110b-specific inhibitors7.We propose that it is this basal\nPtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signal that has been enhanced to drive transforma-\ntion and Akt activation by Pten loss in the murine prostate (Fig. 3d).\nAlternatively, the differential effects of p110a and p110b ablationmay\narise because the signal activating PI(3)K is generated by an as yet\nunidentified GPCR or a receptor tyrosine kinase that functions\nthrough p110b.\n\nThus, our data suggest distinct functions for p110b and p110a in\ncell signalling and transformation. We have showed that p110b has\nan important physiological function in metabolic regulation and\nglucose homeostasis, perhaps involving a kinase-independent mech-\nanism. A kinase-independent function of p110b was further sug-\ngested in controlling cell proliferation and trafficking in p110b KO\nMEFs and MEFs reconstituted with a WT or kinase-dead allele of\np110b.

Conditional knockout mice of p110b\nwere generated using the Cre-LoxP system. In brief, the targeting construct was\n\nassembled by isolating a 7.5-kilobase genomic fragment of Pik3cb from 129SvEv\n\nmouse strain and inserting two LoxP sites to flank exon 2 of Pik3cb. The targeting\n\nconstruct was electroporated into embryonic stem (ES) cells of 129SvEv mouse.\n\nES clones carrying floxed Pik3cb were injected into the blastocysts of C57BL/6\n\nmice. Male chimaeras were bred to C57BL/6 females to establish germline trans-\n\nmission of the conditional allele. The resulting heterozygous line (p110b\nflox/1\n\n)\n\nwas intercrossed to yield a homozygous line (p110b\nflox/flox\n\n).\nFor metabolic studies, 8\u201310-week-old male p110b\n\nflox/flox\nlittermates were tail-\n\nvein injected with 75 ml of adenovirus CMV-lacZ and CMV-cre (titre between\n10\n\n10\nand 43 10\n\n10\nplaque-forming unitsml\n\n21\n; University of Iowa Gene Transfer\n\nVector Core). Two weeks after injection of adenoviruses, glucose tolerance test,\n\ninsulin tolerance test, pyruvate challenge and in vivo insulin signalling were\n\nperformed as described previously31. Blood glucose values were determined with\n\nan Accu-Chek AVIVA glucose monitor (Roche). Serum insulin and leptin\n\n(Crystal Chem Inc.), serum-free fatty acids and triacylglycerols (Wako) and\n\nserum cholesterol (Thermo) were measured by ELISA in accordance with the\n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nIt took two steps to generate compound mice for tumour studies. All floxed\n\nmice used were originally in the 129-C57BL/6 background and had been back-\n\ncrossed once to C57BL/6. The probasin Cre mice were in the C57BL/6 back-\n\nground. In step 1, male PbCre4 mice were first crossed to the female Pten\nflox/flox\n\n,\n\np110a\nflox/flox\n\nor p110b\nflox/flox\n\nmice, and the male offspring carrying PbCre4 were\n\nthen crossed to female Pten\nflox/flox\n\n, p110a\nflox/flox\n\nor p110b\nflox/flox\n\nmice to obtain\n\nPten\nflox/flox\n\n; PbCre4 (hereafter termed \u2018Pten\n2/2\n\n\u2019), p110a\nflox/flox\n\n; PbCre4 (here-\n\nafter termed \u2018p110a\n2/2\n\n\u2019) or p110b\nflox/flox\n\n; PbCre4 (hereafter termed \u2018p110b\n2/2\n\n\u2019)\nmice, respectively. We used cohorts of littermates lacking the probasin Cre\n\ntransgene as wild-type controls (Pten\nflox/flox\n\n, p110a\nflox/flox\n\nor p110b\nflox/flox\n\n), and\n\nno significant differences were observed between these groups.\n\nIn step 2, Pten\n2/2\n\nmale mice were crossed with female p110a\nflox/flox\n\nor\n\np110b\nflox/flox\n\nmice, and their male offspring carrying PbCre were crossed further\n\nwith Pten\nflox/wt\n\n; p110a\nflox/wt\n\nor Pten\nflox/wt\n\n; p110b\nflox/wt\n\nlittermates to obtain the\n\ndesired Pten\nflox/flox\n\n; p110a\nflox/flox\n\n; PbCre4 (hereafter termed \u2018Pten\n2/2\n\n;\n\np110a\n2/2\n\n\u2019) or Pten\nflox/flox\n\n; p110b\nflox/flox\n\n; PbCre4 (hereafter termed \u2018Pten\n2/2\n\n;\n\np110b\n2/2\n\n\u2019) compound strains. The resultant Pten\nflox/flox\n\n; p110a\nflox/flox\n\n; PbCre4\n\nor Pten\nflox/flox\n\n; p110b\nwt/wt\n\n; PbCre4 mice from the same litters displayed high-\n\ngrade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia comparable to that of Pten\nflox/flox\n\n;\n\nPbCre4 mice described in step 1, and were used interchangeably as tumour\n\ncontrols. Cohorts of littermates lacking the probasin Cre transgene were used\n\nas wild-type controls showing no significant differences from wild-type controls\n\nin step 1.\n\nAlternatively, in step 2 Pten\n2/2\n\n; p110a\n2/2\n\nor Pten\n2/2\n\n; p110b\n2/2\n\nmales were\n\ncrossed with female littermates of Pten\nflox/lox\n\n; p110a\nflox/lox\n\nor Pten\nflox/flox\n\n;\n\np110b\nflox/flox\n\nto generate larger numbers of the desired compound strains. No\ndifferences were seen in phenotypes in compound animals generated by either\n\nversion of step 2.\n\nPrimary and immortalized MEFs.MEFs were prepared from embryos derived\nfrom intercrossing p110b\n\nflox/1\nheterozygotes at embryonic day 13.5 after fert-\n\nilization. Primary WT or floxed MEFs, and DNp53 immortalized WT or floxed\n\nMEFs were treated with Ade-Cre to generateWT control and p110b-null (bKO)\ncells. Additional control cells used in our study were floxed MEFs without Ade-\n\nCre treatment. bKO1b and bKO1KR lines were generated by introducing\neither HA-tagged WT human p110b or a kinase-inactive mutant K805R into\nbKO MEFs and then treated with Ade-Cre. Genotyping of MEFs was done by\nPCR using primer sets: LLF with LLR, and SLF with LLR (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nGrowth factors and western blotting. Cells were starved either for 2 h or over-\nnight followed by stimulation with insulin (2.5mgml\n\n21\n; Sigma I2767), EGF\n\n(10 ngml\n21\n; Sigma E9644), IGF1 (5 ngml\n\n21\n, Upstate 01-208), LPA (10mM;\n\nSigma L7260) or 10% FBS for various periods as indicated in the corresponding\n\nfigures. Western blot assays were performed as described previously8 with anti-\n\nbodies against PTEN (no. 9552), p110a (no. 4255), phospho-Akt (Ser 473 (no.\n9271) or Thr 308, no. 9275), Akt (no. 9272), phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr 389,\n\nno. 9205), phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (no. 9101), phospho-S6 ribosomal\n\nprotein (Ser 235/Ser 236, no. 2211) and S6 ribosomal protein (no. 2217) (Cell\n\nSignalling), p85 (Upstate 06-195), p110b (Santa Cruz, sc-602), Tubulin and\nVinculin (Sigma T6199 and V9131). Immunofluorescently labelled anti-mouse\n\nIgG (Rockland Immunochemicals 610-132-003) and anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular\n\nProbes) were used to visualize western blots on an Odyssey scanner. The quan-\n\ntification of western blots was performed with Odyssey software version 2.0.\n\nGrowth curves. MEFs were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates and stained\nwith crystal violet at each indicated time point. The dye was extracted with 10%\n\nacetic acid followed by plate reading at 590 nm. The values were normalized to\n\nthe absorbance at day 0. Data shown are the average of at least two independent\n\nexperiments.\n\nCell cycle analysis. Cells were synchronized by starvation in DMEM supple-\nmented with 0.1% FBS for 48 h before being released into the cell cycle by\n\nstimulation with 10% FBS. Cells were pulse-labelled with BrdU at each indicated\n\ntime point and analysed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (BD\n\nBiosciences).\n\nFocus formation assays.MEFs at 40\u201350% confluence were infected with various\nretroviruses: pBabe\u2013Vector, pBabe\u2013HRas-G12V or pBabe\u2013EGFR-Del (DL747\u2013\nE749, A750P) and then cultured for 14\u201321 days forWT, bKO1b and bKO1KR\ncells, but for 30\u201340 days for bKO cells. Confluent monolayers with foci were\nfixed in ethanol and stained with crystal violet.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry. Prostate tissues were processed and\nstained as described previously32. Primary antibody used in immunohistochem-\n\nistry was directed against phospho-Akt (Ser 473) (no. 3787, Cell Signalling).\n\nLipid kinase assays. In vitro lipid kinase assays were performed as described\npreviously8,18. In brief, anti-p110b (Santa Cruz) immunoprecipitates from\nfreshly prepared cell lysates were subjected to an in vitro lipid kinase assay with\n\nphosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids) as the substrate. The phosphorylated\n\nlipids were resolved by thin-layer chromatography, detected by autoradiography\n\nand quantified with Adobe Photoshop.\n\nTransferrin internalization assays. Cells were seeded on 10% poly-(L-lysine)-\ncoated coverslips and grown overnight in DMEM medium supplemented with\n\n10% FBS. The assay was performed as described previously33 with Alexa\n\nFluor555-conjugated human transferrin (Invitrogen), counterstained with 4,6-\n\ndiamidino-2-phenylindole (1 mgml\n21\n; Sigma) and mounted with mounting\n\nmedium (Fisher Scientific). Cells were observed with a Zeiss confocal micro-\n\nscope LSM510META/NLO at 363 magnification, and images were captured\n\nwith Zeiss confocal microscope software 3.2.\n\nLaser capture microdissection and DNA extraction. Laser capture microdis-\nsection was performed as described previously34. Genomic DNA of microdis-\n\nsected prostate epithelium was extracted with phenol/chloroform before PCR\n\nanalysis.\n\nQuantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis. Liver total RNAs were\nextracted with the use of the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The following gene expression\n\nassay probes (Applied Biosystems) were used for real-time RT\u2013PCR quantifica-\n\ntion: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK/Pck1, ID no.\n\nMm00440636_m1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase, ID no. Mm00839363_m1),\n\nfructose bisphosphatase 1 (Fbp1, ID no. Mm00490181_m1), hepatic nuclear factor\n\n4 (Hnf4a, ID no. Mm00433964_m1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-\n\ngenase (GAPDH, catalogue no. 4352339E). Expressionwas normalized tomRNA\n\nfor GAPDH and results were expressed as fold change in mRNA compared with\n\nthe indicated control mice.\n\n31. Taniguchi, C. M. et al.
