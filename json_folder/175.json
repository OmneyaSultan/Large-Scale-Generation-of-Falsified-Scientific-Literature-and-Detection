The aim of this\nstudy was to explore the role of SIRT1 signaling on Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-\ninduced IL-17 and IL-23 production in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs). IL-17 and IL-23 pro-\nduction was significantly increased in LPS-treated cells. LPS treatment also led to the upregulation of\nSIRT1 mRNA and protein expression. LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 upregulation was attenuated by pre-\ntreatment with inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase\n(ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and NF-jB, as well as\nneutralizing antibodies against Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4. Sirtinol treatment (a known SIRT1\ninhibitor) or SIRT1 knockdown by small interfering RNA blocked LPS-stimulated IL-17 and IL-23 expres-\nsion. Further investigation showed that LPS decreased osteoblast markers (i.e., ALP, OPN, and BSP) and\nconcomitantly increased osteoclast markers (i.e., RANKL and M-CSF). This response was attenuated by\ninhibitors of the PI3K, p38, ERK, JNK, NF-jB, and SIRT1 pathways. These findings, for the first time, sug-\ngest that human periodontopathogen P. gingivalis LPS is implicated in periodontal disease bone destruc-\ntion and may mediate IL-17 and IL-23 release from hPDLCs. This process is dependent, at least in part, on\nSIRT1-Akt/PI3K-MAPK-NF-jB signaling.\n\n\ufffd 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nPeriodontitis is a chronic destructive inflammatory disease of\nteeth-supporting tissues [i.e., connective tissue of the periodontal\nligament and alveolar bone]. This inflammatory condition is initi-\nated by a complex bacterial biofilm localized in the subgingival\nenvironment, where Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major causative\npathogen [1]. Elevated P. gingivalis levels are present in periodontal\nlesions and are significantly reduced by successful therapy [2]. P.\ngingivalis modulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,\nsuch as interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a by gingival epithe-\nlial cells [3,4]. Several reports indicate that specific components of\nP. gingivalis, including fimbriae and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in-\nduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production (i.e., IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8,\nand TNF-a) in human and murine monocytes and macrophages\nll rights reserved.\n\naxillofacial Tissue Regenera-\neogi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu,\n6; fax: +82 2 960 1457.\n\ncorresponding author.\n[5,6]. In addition, P. gingivalis LPS leads to periodontal tissue\ndestruction and alveolar bone resorption through IL-6 and IL-8 re-\nlease from human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs; [7]), and\nthese inflammatory cytokines play a role in the destruction and\ndisintegration of the extracellular matrix [8]. We previously re-\nported that hPDLCs may play an important role, as these cells pro-\nduce inflammatory cytokines, including receptor activator of\nnuclear factor-jB ligand (RANKL; [9\u201314]), which is related to bone\nmetabolism in periodontal diseases. However, the mechanisms by\nwhich local immune responses against bacterial virulence factors\nresult in the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues remains to\nbe established.\n\nAmong the inflammatory cytokines implicated in inflammatory\ndisease, much interest is focused on two recently identified cyto-\nkines: IL-23 and IL-17. IL-17 (also known as IL-17A), a pro-inflam-\nmatory cytokine that is regulated by IL-23, is crucial for the\ndevelopment of a novel CD4+ T-cell subset called T-helper 17\n(Th17) cells, which promote tissue inflammation in host-defense\nresponses against infection [15]. Enhanced IL-17 expression is\nreported in various inflammation models, including rheumatoid\narthritis, periodontitis, asthma, and organ rejection [16\u201318]. In\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.05.021\nmailto:eckim@khu.ac.kr\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.05.021\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine\n\n\nY.-D. Park et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 284\u2013293 285\naddition, IL-17 may affect osteoclast resorption indirectly through\nosteoblasts, like other pro-inflammatory cytokines [19,20]. IL-17\nlevels in inflamed gingival tissues of periodontitis are higher than\nthose in healthy control tissues [16,21]. Similarly, the amount of\nIL-17 in gingival crevicular fluid samples is significantly higher in\nperiodontitis patients [22,23]. Furthermore, IL-17RA-deficient mice\nhave enhanced periodontal bone destruction following P. gingivalis\ninfection, suggesting a bone-protective role of IL-17 [24]. IL-23, a\nheterodimeric protein that is composed of the IL-12p40 subunit\nand a specific IL-23p19 subunit, is primarily produced by activated\ndendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages [25]. IL-23, in conjunc-\ntion with IL-1, then contributes to the expansion and maintenance of\nTh17 cells that, once activated, release the cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F,\nIL-22, TNF-a, and IL-6, all of which can induce inflammatory\nresponses [26]. Furthermore, high numbers of IL-17- and IL-23-\nexpressing cells are present in the ileum of Crohn\u2019s disease [27],\nactive uveitis of Bechet\u2019s disease [28], lupus nephritis [29], and\ngingival tissue of periodontitis patients [16].\n\nSIRT1 is a prominent member of the NAD+-dependent enzyme\nfamily and affects a variety of cellular functions ranging from gene\nsilencing, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and differentiation to en-\nergy homeostasis [30\u201332]. Several recent studies implicated SIRT1\nin the regulation of inflammatory responses [33,34]. SIRT1 can also\ninhibit nuclear transcription factor-jB (NF-jB), a master transcrip-\ntion factor involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cyto-\nkines, which enhances cell death in response to the inflammatory\ncytokine TNF-a [35]. However, very little is known regarding\nwhether SIRT1 regulates LPS-induced IL-23 or IL-23 axis signaling,\nparticularly in periodontitis bone destruction.\n\nThis study was designed to gain further knowledge on the im-\npact of P. gingivalis LPS on the regulation of IL-17 and IL-23 produc-\ntion, and homeostasis between osteoblastic and osteoclastic genes\nin hPDLCs. We also investigated potential mechanisms involved in\nthis process, including the role of SIRT1.\nTable 1\nReverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers and conditions.\n\nGene Sequence (50\u201330) Size\n(bp)\n\nTm\n(\ufffdC)\n\nIL-17 Forward: CGATGACTCCTGGGAAGACCTC 490 60\nReverse: GTGTGGGCTCCCCAGAGCTCTTA\n\nIL-23 Forward: GCAGATTCCAAGCCTCAGTC 524 60\nReverse: TTCAACATATGCAGGTCCCA\n\nALP Forward: ACGTGGCTAAGAATGTCATC 475 55\nReverse: CTGGTAGGCGATGTCCTTA\n\nOPN Forward: AATGAAAACGAAGAAAGCGAAG 347 55\nReverse: ATCATAGCCATCGTAGCCTTGT\n\nBSP Forward: TGGAGATGACAGTTCAGAAG 333 52\nReverse: GTACTGGTGCCGTTTATGC\n\nOPG Forward: TGCAGTACGTCAAGCAGGAG 575 56\nReverse: TGACCTCTGTGAAAACAGC\n\nRANKL Forward: GCCAGTGGGAGATGTTAG 486 55\nReverse: TTAGCTGCAAGTTTTCCC\n\nM-CSF Forward: ATGACAGACAGGTGGAACTGCCAGTGTAGAGG 437 60\nReverse: TCACACAACTTCAGTAGGTTCAGGTGA TGGGC\n\nSIRT-1 Forward: GCAACATCTTATGATTGGCACA 820 60\nReverse: AAATACCATCCCTTGACCTGAA\n\nb-Actin Forward: CATGGATGATGATATCGCCGCG 371 55\nReverse: ACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTCG\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Reagents\n\nSirtinol and LPS (from P. gingivalis) were purchased from\nSigma\u2013Aldrich Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO). Human IL-17 ELISA\nKit was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN).\nAffinity purified polyclonal antibodies against mouse TLR2, TLR4,\nIjB-a, NF-jB p65 and b-actin monoclonal antibodies were ob-\ntained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Delaware Avenue, CA).\nAnti-human TLR2 and TLR4 monoclonal antibodies (Abcam, Cam-\nbridge, UK) were used for in vitro neutralization studies in hPDL\ncells. Antibodies (Abs) against phospho-ERK (p-ERK), ERK, phos-\npho-p38 (p-p38), p38, phospho-JNK (p-JNK), and JNK were pur-\nchased from Cell Signaling. Wortmannin was purchased from\nCalbiochem (San Diego, CA).\n\n2.2. Cell culture\n\nImmortalized hPDLCs, transfected with human telomerase cata-\nlytic component (hTERT), were kindly provided by professor Takashi\nTakata (Hiroshima University, Japan) [37]. Cells were cultured in\na-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and\n100 lg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at\n37 \ufffdC.\n\n2.3. Western blot analysis\n\nCells (1 \ufffd 106) from each set of experiments were harvested\nand washed twice in cold tris-buffered saline. Cells were\nsolubilized in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. After 30 min\non ice, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Proteins\n(20 lg) were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE (10% acrylamide), transferred\nto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with specific Abs\n(diluted 1/1000), followed by incubation with secondary HRP-con-\njugated Ab (1/5000). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemilu-\nminescence system according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions\nand exposed to X-ray film. Densitometricanalysis of each blot\nwas performed with a computerized image processing system\n(Quantity One; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).\n\n2.4. RNA isolation and Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR)\n\nCells (5 \ufffd 105) were cultured in 60-mm culture dishes until 70%\nconfluency, and incubated for 24 h in a serum free medium con-\ntaining stimuli as indicated. The total RNA of pulp cells was ex-\ntracted using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg,\nMD) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Then 1 lg RNA\nwas reverse-transcribed for first strand cDNA synthesis (Gibco\nBRL, Rockville, MD). The cDNA was amplified in a final volume of\n20 lL containing 2.5 mM magnesium dicholoride, 1.25 units Ex\nTaq polymerase (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) and 1 lM specific prim-\ners. Amplification was carried out for 30 cycles in a DNA thermal\ncycler. Primer sequences for differentiation markers are detailed\nin Table 1. The PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel\nand stained with ethidium bromide. The intensity of each band\nafter normalization with beta-actin mRNA was quantified on the\nphotographed gels with a densitometer (Quantity One; Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA).\n\n2.5. Measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n\nThe concentrations of IL-17 in the culture supernatants were\ndetermined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nkit according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended procedure. The\nplates were read at 450 nm on a microplate reader (Molecular\nDevices, Sunnyvale, CA).\n\n2.6.

Statistical analysis\n\nDifferences among the groups were analyzed using one-way\nanalysis of variance combined with the Duncan\u2019s multiple range\ntests.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effects of LPS on IL-17, IL-23, and SIRT1 mRNA and protein\nexpression\n\nTo investigate whether LPS could induce IL-17 and IL-23\ncytokines in hPDLCs, cells were stimulated with various LPS\nconcentrations, and cytokine production was measured by reverse\ntranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot-\nting, and ELISA (Fig. 1A\u2013F). IL-17 and IL-23 mRNA and protein\nexpression were upregulated by LPS in a time- and concentra-\ntion-dependent fashion, with cytokine accumulation peaking at\n1 lg/ml 24 h LPS posttreatment (Fig. 1A\u2013D). After 24 h LPS stimu-\nlation, hPDLCs secreted significant amounts of IL-17; a LPS concen-\ntration of 1 lg/ml induced the largest production (Fig. 1E and F).\n\nTo understand the role of SIRT1 in LPS-induced cell signaling\nprocesses, we first assessed the expression of SIRT1 mRNA and pro-\ntein by RT-PCR and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A\u2013D, LPS\ntreatment significantly increased SIRT1 protein and mRNA levels\nin a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a maximal\neffect at 1 lg/ml for 24 h. LPS (1 lg/ml) did not adversely affect cell\nviability (data not shown) and was thus used in subsequent\nexperiments.\n\n3.2. Signaling pathways of LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 expression\n\nTo determine the signaling pathways involved in the upregula-\ntion of IL-17 and IL-23 expression by LPS in hPDLCs, we examined\nthe activation states of Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB. LPS treatment\ninduced phosphorylation of Akt, p38, ERK, and JNK without affect-\ning the total levels of these kinases. In addition, LPS treatment\nincreased the NF-jB p65 nuclear translocation and IjB-a degrada-\ntion in hPDLCs (Fig. 2).\n\nTo further examine the roles of Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB in LPS-in-\nduced IL-17 and IL-23, pharmacological inhibitors of signaling\nintermediates were used. Pretreatment with inhibitors of phospha-\ntidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (LY294002 and wortmannin), p38\n(SB203580), ERK (PD98059), JNK (SP600125), and NF-jB (pyrroli-\ndine dithiocarbamate, PDTC) blocked LPS-induced SIRT1, IL-17,\nand IL-23 expression, and IL-17 secretion in hPDLCs (Fig. 3A\u2013C).\n\nTo determine whether the increased SIRT1 level was associated\nwith LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 expression, hPDLCs were pre-\ntreated with the pharmacological SIRT1 inhibitor sirtinol. After\n1 h sirtinol pretreatment, cells were treated with LPS for 24 h\nand subjected to immunoblot analysis. The data showed that\nLPS-induced SIRT1, IL-17, and IL-23 expression and that IL-17\nsecretion was attenuated by sirtinol pretreatment (Fig. 3A\u2013C).\n\n3.3. Effects of signaling pathway inhibitors on LPS-induced osteogenic\nand osteoclastogenic gene expression\n\nTo investigate the putative mechanism linking IL-17 and IL-23\nto alveolar bone homeostasis, we analyzed the expression pattern\nof osteogenic and osteoclastogenic genes associated with bone-loss\nconditions. As shown in Fig. 4, LPS treatment concomitantly down-\nregulated the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopon-\ntin (OPN), and bone sialoprotein (BSP) mRNA expression, and\nupregulated the expression of nuclear factor j B-ligands (RANKL)\nand macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF), but not\nosteoprotegerin (OPG). Treatment with sirtinol, LY294002 and\nwortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), U0126\n(ERK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and PDTC (NF-jB inhib-\nitor) blocked the effects of LPS on the upregulation of RANKL and\nM-CSF, and downregulation of ALP, OPN, and BSP mRNA expression\n(Fig. 4). The vehicle control was 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\nbecause sirtinol was dissolved in DMSO.\n\n3.4. Functional role of TLR2 and TLR4 on LPS-induced response\n\nSince TLR2 or TLR4 serves as the main mediator of responses to\nLPS, we initially examined whether LPS influenced the expression\nof TLR2 and TLR4 in hPDLCs. Following LPS exposure, TLR2 and\nTRL4 protein levels increased in a time- and concentration-depen-\ndent manner (Fig. 5A and B). To assess the functional involvement\nof TLR2 and TLR4 in LPS-induced cytokine response of hPDLCs, cells\nwere incubated with anti-TLR2 or anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody\n(10 lg/ml) before LPS stimulation. Antibody specificity was\nassessed by incubating with control IgG from non-immunized\n\n\n\nFig. 3.

Cells were preincubated with (A) medium only or with\nwortmannin (WM; PI3K inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), sirtinol (SIRT1 inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 kinase inhibitor), PD98059 (ERK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor),\nPDTC (NF-kB inhibitor), or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 60 min before stimulation with 1 lg/ml P. gingivalis LPS for 1 h.

In addi-\ntion, treatment of cells with anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 antibodies\nblocked LPS-induced SIRT1, IL-17, and IL-23 upregulation, but\nIgG1 and IgG2a did not (Fig. 6A\u2013C). The anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR2\nantibodies also attenuated LPS-induced osteogenic and osteoclas-\ntogenic gene mRNA expression (Fig. 6D).\n3.5. Effect of SIRT1 siRNA on LPS-induced responses\n\nTo further confirm the role of SIRT1 in LPS-induced IL-17, IL-23,\nand osteoblastic and osteoclastogenic gene expression, we knocked\ndown SIRT1 with a specific siRNA. As shown in Fig. 7A, SIRT1 siRNA\nsuccessfully knocked down SIRT1 expression in hPDLCss and\nblocked LPS-induced IL-17 secretion, expression of the mRNAs\nencoding IL-17 and IL-23, osteoblastic genes (ALP, OPN, BSP), and\nosteoclastogenic genes (RANKL and M-CSF), whereas transfection\nof cells with an equivalent amount of nonspecific siRNA had no\neffect (Fig. 7B\u2013E).\n\nTo elucidate the molecular basis of the responses to SIRT1 inhi-\nbition, we examined the effects of SIRT1 siRNA on LPS-induced Akt,\nMAPK, and NF-jB signaling pathways in hPDLCs. As shown in\nFig. 8, SIRT1 siRNA pretreatment decreased LPS-induced phosphor-\nylation of Akt, p38, ERK, and JNK, and the degradation of IjBa and\nthe nuclear translocation of p65 (NF-jB).\n4. Discussion\n\nPeriodontal disease is triggered by potentially hazardous micro-\norganisms, which induce consequent immune-inflammatory re-\nsponses. IL-17 treatment of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs)\nleads to IL-6 production, and IL-8 and intercellular adhesion mole-\ncule (ICAM)-1 expression [37], which may contribute to local tissue\ninflammation. Furthermore, IL-17 induces RANKL expression via\ninduction of prostaglandin E2 production in osteoblasts and is\nreleased by IL-23 stimulation [38,39]. Moreover, both IL-23 and\nIL-27 inhibit bone marrow cell osteoclastogenesis induced by\nM-CSF/soluble RANKL [40]. Whether the IL-23/IL-17 pathway is in-\nvolved in periodontal bone destruction is unclear, although in-\ncreased IL-17 and IL-23 levels are found in gingival tissue and\ncrevicular fluid of patients with periodontitis [16,21\u201323]. There-\nfore, our study was designed to investigate the association be-\ntween periodontal bone loss and production of IL-23 and IL-17\nby the periodontopathogen P. gingivalis LPS in hPDLCs.\n\nAs primary hPDLCs are heterogeneous cell populations with\nvaried proliferative potential, long-term culture of hPDLCs is apt\nto reduce the number of cells with low proliferative potential, so\nthat their primary phenotype is lost [41]. Consequently, reproduc-\nible results are difficult to obtain and the biology and regenerative\nmechanism of hPDLCs is difficult to clarify by using primary cells\n[42]. Therefore, to address this issue, we used immortalized\nhPDLCs, which retain the features of their original primary cells,\n\n\n\nFig. 6. Effect of blocking TLR2 and TLR4 on LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 production (A\u2013C), SIRT1 expression (A and B), and osteoblastic and osteoclastic genes (D). Cells were\npreincubated with or without TLR2 or TLR4 mAbs or isotype control (IC) abs for 60 min before stimulation with 1 lg/ml P. gingivalis LPS for 24 h. Histogram is densitometric\nquantitation of mRNA or protein expression. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. \ufffdStatistically significant difference compared to the control\ngroup, p < 0.05. #Statistically significant difference compared to the LPS-treated group, p < 0.05.\n\n290 Y.-D. Park et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 284\u2013293\nviz., hPDLCs [36]. In addition, Kitagawa et al. [36] demonstrated\nthat F-spondin increased the expressions of ALP, OCN, and BSP\nmRNA, and ALP activity in immortalized hPDLCs. Thus, immortal-\nized this cell line is helpful tools for studying the biology and\nregenerative mechanisms of hPDLCs.\n\nLPS is a well-known endotoxin which elicits a variety of inflam-\nmatory responses. In humans, LPS binds the CD14/TLR4/MD2\nreceptor complex, which triggers the signaling cascade for many\ncell types to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide\n[43]. LPS-treated hPDLCs were found to respond to the endotoxin\nby activation of TLR4 and TLR2, promotion of NF-jB subunit p65\ntranslocation to the nucleus and enhanced expression of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines [13,44]. To examine the role of IL-17 and\nIL-23 signaling in the LPS response, we first analyzed IL-17 and\nIL-23 protein and mRNA levels. Our results indicate that LPS\ninduces IL-17 and IL-23 expression and IL-17 secretion in a time-\nand concentration-dependent manner, which is consistent with\nthe previous finding that LPS stimulates pro-inflammatory cyto-\nkines such as IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 IL-10, TNF-a, and IL-12 in hPDLCs\n[13,44,45]. Following LPS exposure, parallel to IL-17 and IL-23\nupregulation, we detected increased protein and mRNA levels of\nSIRT1. These results are consistent with our previous study, which\nshowed that SIRT1 mRNA and protein is upregulated by LPS and\nheat stress in dental pulp cells [33].\n\nAkt/PI3K, MAPK, and NF-jB pathways play a pivotal role in\npro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine regulation [18,32\u201334].\nOur results demonstrated that LPS activated Akt/PI3K, p38, JNK,\nERKK, and NF-jB pathways in hPDLCs. Based on the results of a\ncytotoxicity assay, we used optimal inhibitor concentrations of\nPI3K (20 lM LY294002 and 100 nM wortmannin), ERK (20 lM\nPD98059), p38 MAPK (20 lM SB203580), JNK (10 lM SP600125),\nand NF-jB (1 mM PDTC) that elicited inhibitory effects without\ntoxicity. Our results showed that SB203580, PD98058, SP600125,\nwortmannin, LY294002, and PDTC downregulated LPS-induced IL-\n17 and IL-23, which suggests that Akt/PI3K, ERK, p38, JNK, and\nNF-jB mediate LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 expression in HDP cells.\nConsistent with our data on hPDLCs, IL-17 produced by activated\nrheumatoid arthritis peripheral blood mononuclear cells is com-\npletely or partly blocked in the presence of the PDTC, wortmannin,\nand LY294002 [18].\n\n\n\nFig. 7. Effects of SIRT1 siRNA on P. gingivalis LPS-induced SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels (A and B), osteoblastic and osteoclastic genes (C), and IL-17 and IL-23 production (D\u2013\nF). Cells were transiently transfected with a control vector or SIRT1 siRNA, followed by 24 h LPS treatment. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.\nHistogram is densitometric quantitation of mRNA or protein expression. \ufffdStatistically significant difference compared to the control group, p < 0.05. #Statistically significant\ndifference compared to the LPS-treated group, p < 0.05.\n\nY.-D. Park et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 284\u2013293 291\nTLR2 and TLR4, transmembrane receptors that transmit the LPS\nsignal to intracellular components in signal transduction path-\nways, play important roles in the immune system [46]. TLR4 is\nassociated with the recognition of Gram-negative bacterial LPS,\nand TLR2 is regarded as the receptor for Gram-positive bacteria\n[47]. Tabeta et al. [48] reported that P. gingivalis LPS stimulates\nhuman gingival fibroblasts to secrete IL-1 and IL-6 via TLR4. In\ncontrast, Zhang et al. [49] found that P. gingivalis LPS could utilize\nboth TLR2 and TLR4 to induce the production of cytokines such as\nTNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 in THP-1 cells. In the present study, we ob-\nserved that TLR4 and TLR2 expression increased in hPDLCs exposed\nto P. gingivalis LPS and that neutralizing anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4\nantibodies specifically inhibited P. gingivalis LPS-induced expres-\nsion and secretion of IL-17 and IL-23, as well as Akt/PI3K activation\nand its downstream pathways, including MAPK and NF-jB. These\nresults suggest that TLR2 and TRL4 play important roles in the\ndefense mechanisms of microorganisms by stimulating a wide\nrepertoire of signal transduction pathways that promote inflam-\nmatory processes.\n\nRecent studies implicated SIRT1 in the regulation of inflamma-\ntory responses [32\u201334]. Resveratrol-induced SIRT1 activation or\nadenoviral-mediated SIRT1 overexpression blocks the expression\nand release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to environ-\nmental stress [50,51]. To assess the role of SIRT1 in IL-17 and IL-23\nexpression in hPDLCs, we tested the effects of SIRT1 inhibition and\ngene silencing. In the present study, we showed that downregulat-\ning SIRT1 expression via SIRT1 siRNA or blocking SIRT1 activity via\nsirtinol prevented LPS-mediated induction of IL-17 and IL-23\nexpression and production. This result is consistent with the previ-\nous finding that inhibition of SIRT1 by sirtinol reduces cytokine\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Effects of SIRT1 siRNA on P. gingivalis LPS-induced Akt, MAPK, and NF-kB\nactivation. Cells were transiently transfected with control vector or SIRT1 siRNA,\nfollowed by 1 h LPS treatment.

Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.\n#Statistically significant difference compared to the LPS-treated group, p < 0.05.\n\n292 Y.-D.

These results suggested that SIRT1 inhibi-\ntion may modulate the inflammatory response to periodontal\npathogens in hPDLCs.\n\nIn the present study, downregulation of SIRT1 expression levels\nby siRNA diminished LPS-stimulated Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB activa-\ntion. This may indicate that SIRT1 plays a modulatory role within\nthe LPS signaling cascade. Reciprocally, we observed inhibitors\nfor Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB blocked LPS-induced SIRT1 mRNA and\nprotein expression. These results suggested that SIRT1 activation\nmay be an important upstream target of Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB\nin the regulation of hPDLCs. Consistent with these findings, we pre-\nviously reported that inhibitors for PI3K, MAPK and NF-jB blocked\nthe mechanical stress-induced SIRT1 mRNA expression in hPDLCs\n[32]. Overall, the above findings suggest that direct functional\ninteraction between SIRT1 and LPS signaling does exist in hPDLCs\nculture models.\n\nPeriodontal inflammation affects the net loss of bone by en-\nhanced resorption and diminished bone formation. hPDLCs have\nosteoblastic properties and express ALP, OPN, and BSP [55].\nMoreover, hPDLCs express RANKL, OPG, and M-CSF [11,14,34],\nwhich contribute to bone metabolism regulation, such as\nosteoclastogenesis. To evaluate hDPLCs differentiation status, we\nanalyzed the mRNA expression of different genes involved in\nosteoblast (ALP, OPN, and BSP) and osteoclast differentiation\n(RANKL, OPG, and M-CSF). Our data demonstrated that LPS down-\nregulated osteoblastic differentiation marker mRNA (ALP, OPN, and\nBSP) and concomitantly upregulated the expression of osteoclast\ndifferentiation markers (RANKL and M-CSF). These results are con-\nsistent with a previous study on the osteoclastic-inducing effects\n[56] and osteoblastic-inhibiting effects of P. gingivalis LPS [57]. In\nthe present study, hPDLCs pretreatment with inhibitors of PI3K,\np38 MAPK, ERK, JNK, NF-jB, anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR2 antibodies,\nsirtinol, and SIRT1 siRNA blocked LPS-induced upregulation of\nosteoclast markers (RANKL and M-CSF) and prevented downregu-\nlation of osteoblast markers (ALP, OPN, and BSP). Furthermore,\nSIRT1 inhibition by sirtinol and SIRT1 siRNA blocked LPS-induced\nactivation of Akt/PI3K, p38, ERK, JNK, and NF-jB. These results sug-\ngest that SIRT1, AKt/PI3K, p38, ERK, JNK, and NF-jB, TLR2, and\nTLR4 pathways are involved in these responses. Further studies\nare needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of action of LPS\non SIRT1 signaling.\n\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that\nSIRT1, Akt/PI3K, MAPK, NF-jB, TLR2, and TLR4 signaling pathways\nare involved in regulating the Th17-related molecules IL-17 and IL-\n23, which are stimulated by P. gingivalis LPS treatment in hPDLCs.\nPharmacological modulation of SIRT1 may be a novel therapeutic\napproach for modulating the inflammatory response and bone\ndestruction associated with periodontal disease.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by Mid-career Researcher Program\nthrough National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded\nby the (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) (No.\n2009-0078526).\nReferences\n\n[1] Haffajee AD, Socransky SS.
