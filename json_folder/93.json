Its action is possibly through an increase in neural cell survival.\nThe mechanism of improved survival rate of neurons by FLXmay relate to the overexpression of some kinases such as Akt protein.\nAkt1 (a serine/threonine kinase) plays a key role in the modulation of cell proliferation and survival. Our study evaluated the\neffects of FLX on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fate and Akt1 phosphorylation levels in MSCs. Evaluation tests included reverse\ntranscriptase polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunocytochemistry assays. Nestin, MAP-2, and \ud835\udefd-tubulin were\ndetected after neurogenesis as neural markers. Ten \ud835\udf07M of FLX upregulated phosphorylation of Akt1 protein in induced hEnSC\nsignificantly. Also FLX did increase viability of these MSCs. Continuous FLX treatment after neurogenesis elevated the survival\nrate of differentiated neural cells probably by enhanced induction of Akt1 phosphorylation. This study addresses a novel role of\nFLX in neurogenesis and differentiated neural cell survival that may contribute to explaining the therapeutic action of fluoxetine\nin regenerative pharmacology.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nRecent works in stem cell biology have opened up new ways\nin therapeutic strategies to replace lost cells with stem cells in\ninjuries. Cell therapy will be an effective strategy for treating\nneurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injuries [1]. How-\never the important part of the successful therapy depends on\ndifferentiation and promoting the survival of implanted cells.\nThe survival rate of stem cells after differentiation and trans-\nplantation is important for the efficacy of cell therapy [2].\nSome factors are involved in the regulation of neurogenesis\nand their survival. Corticosteroids were the first hormones\nfound to have a neurogenesis effect [3]. Neurotransmitters\n\nand growth factors also can affect neurogenesis [4]. Based\non the fact that fluoxetine (FLX) improves brain function,\nresearchers have explored the effect of antidepressants on the\nneurogenesis. FLX was the first selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitor (SSRI) approved for the treatment of depression.\nOn the molecular basis of its clinical efficacy, FLX increases\nserotonin synaptic availability [5]. Increased neurogenesis\nstarted by antidepressants in some manner contributes to\ntheir therapeutic effects [6].These results provide some initial\ninsights, but more work is needed to fully elucidate the SSRI\nactions on stem cell neurogenesis.\n\nTo promote extended survival of transplanted stem cells,\nwe must modulate the properties of the cells. This purpose\n\n\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\nmight be accomplished by overexpressing Akt1 protein which\nis a general mediator of cell survival signal. Akt is a ser-\nine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in the modulation\nof cell proliferation and survival. It is wellknown for its\nantiapoptotic effects against a variety of situations including\noxidative and osmotic stress, irradiation, and ischemic shock\n[7\u201310].\n\nThis study aimed to investigate whether fluoxetine could\ninduce neurogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells and to fur-\nther examine the putative role ofAkt1 and its phosphorylation\nin FLX-mediated effects.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Isolation and Culture of Human Endometrial Stem Cells.\nThis study was carried out in accordance with the Tehran\nUniversity ofMedical Sciences Ethical Committee Law.There\nwas a consent form for each donor that is included in the\nsupplementary data. Here we were using human endometrial\nstem cell (hEnSC) as a source ofmesenchymal stem cell. Stem\ncell was obtained from 30 donors between 25 and 35 years\nold in the gynecology department as described previously\n[11]. Briefly, the biopsies from endometrium were dissected\nand then treated with collagenase (Sigma, USA) for 45min.\nIsolated cells were suspended in phosphate buffered saline\n(PBS, Sigma, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine\nserum (FBS; Gibco, UK), 0.2mM EDTA (Sigma, USA),\n100U/mL penicillin, and 0.1mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco,\nUK).The cells were layered on Ficoll Paque (Sigma,USA) and\ncentrifuged at 400 g for 35min at 4\u2218C. EnSCs were retrieved\nfrom the buffy coat layer, washed in PBS, and then kept in\nDMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, UK). In the passage two, the\nCD146+, CD105+, and CD90+ cells were isolated from total\ncells [12] by the fluorescent analyzer cell sorter (FACS).\n\n2.2. Mesenchymal Stem Cells Differentiation. Human EnSCs\nwere placed on collagen precoated plates with DMEM low-\nglucose medium.The cultures were kept in a humidified 10%\nCO\n2\natmosphere at 37\u2218C for 10 days.Themedia were replaced\n\nwith freshmedia every 3 d. Stem cells that have grown to 70%\nconfluence were pretreated with 1\ud835\udf07M dimethyl-sulfoxide\n(DMSO, Sigma, USA) and then were treated with fluoxetine\n(1, 2, 5, and 10 \ud835\udf07M,Sigma,USA). Treatmentwith 1\ud835\udf07Mretinoic\nacid (RA, Sigma, USA) and dH\n\n2\nO was done as positive\n\nand negative controls in order. Also hEnSCs cultured in\nFLX treated media containing 10 \ud835\udf07Mphosphatidylinositol-3-\nkinase (PI3-K) inhibitor (LY294002, Promega, USA) served\nas control cells to determine the Akt role. After treatment for\n10 d, cells were subjected to examining the Akt1 phosphoryla-\ntion bywestern blot and for specificmarkers of neural cells via\nreverse transcriptase PCR and immunocytochemistry assays.\nIn each experiment, a nontreated group was tested.\n\n2.3. Reverse Transcriptase PCR Analysis for Neural Specific\nMarkers. For collection of total RNA from treated hEnSCs,\nwe used an Isogen kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). RNA quantity\nandpuritywere determined by spectrophotometry (Beckman\n\nDU-65). Standard reverse transcription was performed using\nthe AMV kit (Takara Biomedicals, Ohtsu, Japan) with 1 \ud835\udf07g\nRNA and 0.5 \ud835\udf07g oligo-dT per reaction, according to the man-\nufacturer\u2019s instructions. Reaction mixtures included 2.5\ud835\udf07L\ncDNA, 1x PCR buffer (AMS TM, Cinnagen, Iran), 200\ud835\udf07M\ndNTPs, 0.5 \ud835\udf07M of each of forward and reverse primers\n(Table 1), and 1U Taq DNA polymerase. Polymerase chain\nreactions were performed at 94\u2218C for 1min, 30 cycles 94\u2218C\nfor 30 s, 55\u201363\u2218C for 30 s, and 72\u2218C for 30 s, and 72\u2218C for\n10min. Amplified DNA fragments were electrophoresed on\n1.5% agarose gel.Thegelswere stainedwith ethidiumbromide\n(10 \ud835\udf07g/mL) and photographed on a UV transilluminator\n(Uvidoc, UK).\n\n2.4. Neural Markers Immunostaining. The hEnSCs treated\nwith FLX and FLX + 10 \ud835\udf07M PI3-K inhibitor (LY294002,\nPromega, USA) were fixed by incubation in 9% paraformal-\ndehyde for 20min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100\nfor 10min as described previously [1]. The cells were then\nreacted with primary antibodies for Nestin (Sigma, USA),\nMAP-2 (Sigma, USA), \ud835\udefd-tubulin-III (Chemicon, USA), and\nCD11b as a glial marker (Millipore, USA) at 4\u2218C for 12 h,\nwashed with PBS and reacted with the fluorescent isothio-\ncyanate (FITC) conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma,USA)\nat room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the cells were washed\nwith PBS three times, and DAPI was used for DNA staining.\n\n2.5. Detection of Akt1 Phosphorylation via Western Blotting.\nAfter FLX treatment, the cell lysates were collected and\nprotein concentration was determined by using a protein\nassay kit (Bio-Rad, USA). Total cell extracts containing\nequal amounts of protein in sample buffer were subjected\nto WB analysis as described previously [13]. Briefly, the\nsamples were boiled for 5min and then separated by 12%\nsodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophore-\nsis (SDS-PAGE). After that, the gel was transferred onto\npolyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane for blotting.\nThe membrane was first blocked by incubation in bovine\nalbumin at room temperature for 2 h and then incubated\nwith anti-Akt1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, USA)\nand anti-phospho-Akt1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology,\nUSA) for 2 h at room temperature, washed for 3 times\nwith tris buffer containing Tween-20 and incubated at room\ntemperature with HRP conjugated secondary antibody for\n2 h. The membrane was washed 5 times with tris buffer, and\nthen specific bands were quantified using a ChemiImager\nSystem (Alpha Innotech Corporation). Anti-\ud835\udefd actin antibody\n(Abcam, UK) was used as an internal control.\n\n2.6. Viability Test (MTT) in Neural Differentiated Cells.\nMTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium\nbromide) assay is a useful colorimetric test for detection\nof cell viability. MTT is for measuring the activity of cel-\nlular enzymes that reduce the yellow tetrazolium dye, to\nits insoluble formazan, giving a purple color. Differentiated\nmesenchymal stem cells were tested for their survival time in\nthe presence or absence of FLX. The EnSCs were plated into\n96 well enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates,\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 3\n\nTable 1: Primers used for specific neuronal genes expression.\n\nTarget genes Primer sequences Accession number\n\nNestin F: 5\n\udba0\udc20-GCCCTGACCACTCCAGTTTA-3\udba0\udc20 NM:051373\n\nR: 5\udba0\udc20-GGAGTCCTGGATTTCCTTCC-3\udba0\udc20\n\nMap-2 F: 5\n\udba0\udc20-CCATTTGCAACAGGAAGACAC-3\udba0\udc20 NM:002374.3\n\nR: 5\udba0\udc20-CAGCTCAAATGCTTTGCAACTAT-3\udba0\udc20\n\n\u0392-tubulin F: 5\n\udba0\udc20-ATGTACGAAGACGACGAGGAG-3\udba0\udc20 NM:BC:003021\n\nR: 5\udba0\udc20-GTATCCCCGAAAATATAAACACA-3\udba0\udc20\n\n\ud835\udefd-actin F: 5\n\udba0\udc20-AAGAGAGGCATCCTGACCCT-3\udba0\udc20\n\nR: 5\udba0\udc20-ACATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAAGC-3\udba0\udc20\n\nand the differentiation process was repeated as described\npreviously in Section 2.2. After the differentiation for replac-\ning the culture media, FLX was added to three of the wells\nand PBS was used as a negative control in three other\nwells. Culture plates were incubated for one week. During\nincubation (7 d), culture media were replaced with medium,\ncontaining FLX, FLX + LY294002, and PBS. Cell viability was\nassessed by MTT assay kit (Biotium, Hayward, USA). The\nMTT reagent (10 \ud835\udf07L) was added to the wells and incubated\nfor 3 h. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was\nremoved and 100 \ud835\udf07L DMSO was added into each well. To\ndissolve the formazan crystals, the supernatant was pipetted\nseveral times. Absorbance was measured on an ELISA plate\nreader at a wavelength of 540 nm.\n\n2.7. Labeling Cell with 5-Bromo-20-deoxyuridine. One \ud835\udf07M\nBrdU was added to the cultures for 6 h on the 8th day of\nFLX induction. The cells were observed on the 9th day of\nBrdU labeling and then fixed on the 10th day of development\nand stained for BrdU and Nestin with anti-BrdUmonoclonal\nantibody (Sigma, St. Louis) overnight at 4\u2218C and labeled\nwith secondary antibody conjugated with Rhodamine for 120\nminutes at room temperature. BrdU and Nestin positive cells\nwere counted in 10 microscopic fields. The percentage and\nstandard deviation of double stained cells among all Nestin\npositive cells were calculated.\n\n2.8. Statistical Analyses. Data shownwere expressed asmeans\n\u00b1 S.D. from data obtained in three independent experi-\nments. MTT and western blot results are obtained from six\nindependent experiments. ANOVA was used to compare\nthe effects of all treatments. Differences of viability within\nexperimental groups were determined by theMann-Whitney\ntest. Differences were considered statistically significant at\n\ud835\udc43 \u2264 0.05.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Human Endometrial Stem Cell Culture. Human EnSCs\nanalysis by FACS showed thatmore than 90%of the cells were\nCD146+, CD105+, and CD90+ (Figure 1). This test confirms\nthe true isolation of stem cells from the lining womb. To\ndetermine whether the hEnSCs could respond to FLX or not,\nwe treated the stem cells with 1\u201310 \ud835\udf07g serial concentrations of\n\nFLX over a period of 10 d on collagen precoated and DMSO\npretreated plates. In this work, human EnSCs with spindle\nshaped morphology were cultured (Figure 2(a)). After 10 d,\nfibroblast-like cells with spindle-shapemorphology appeared\non culture dishes (Figure 2(b)). Considering the role of FLX,\nwe investigated its effect on the stem cell differentiation.\nDendrite and axon formation and also neurite outgrowth\nthat are phenotypic changes into neural fate were obvious\n(Figure 2(c)), and it was comparable with retinoic acid effects\nas a positive control (Figure 2(d)).\n\n3.2. Expression of Differential Neural Genes. The in vitro study\nis conducted to determine that the neurogenesis regulating\neffect could be replicated in cell culture system. One week\nafter the treatment of hEnSCs, we examined the neural\nmarkers by RT-PCR. RT-PCR analysis was indicative of the\nexpression of nestin,map-2, and \ud835\udefd-tubulin genes as shown in\nFigure 3.\n\n3.3. Immunostaining of Neuronal Induced Specific Markers.\nFluoxetine treated and differentiatedmesenchymal stem cells\nwere visualized by the staining of some neuronal markers.\nImmunocytochemistry was used to analyze theNestin,MAP-\n2, and \ud835\udefd-tubulin proteins. The result showed that these\nproteins were detected after treatment in 10 d (Figure 4(a)).\nAlso a group of cells that were treated with LY294002 as\na phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor did not\nexpress the neural markers even after 10 d treatment by FLX\n(Figure 4(b)).\n\n3.4. Overexpression of Phosphorylated Akt1. Phosphorylation\nof Akt1 in FLX-treated mesenchymal stem cells as detected\nby western blot was higher than non-FLX-treated stem cells.\nAlso LY294002 as a PI3-K inhibitor inhibited the phosphory-\nlation of Akt1 significantly (Figure 5).\n\n3.5. Viability of FLX Treated Cells. The effect of FLX on the\nsurvival period of the differentiated stem cells was observed\ndirectly and investigated byMTT assay. As shown in Figure 6,\nFLX treatment affects the cell survival rate significantly (\ud835\udc43 <\n0.05) higher than all other groups. While the retinoic acid\nstrongly suppressed cell survival in this assay, the suppressive\neffect of FLX on differentiated stem cells was very low.\nThe continuance of FLX treatment extended the time and\n\n\n\n4 BioMed Research International\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nCD90\n\n0 102 103 104 105\n\nNegative\nPositive\n\n(a)\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nCD105\n\n0 102 103 104 105\n\nNegative\nPositive\n\n(b)\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nCD146\n0 102 103 104 105\n\nNegative\nPositive\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 1: Characterization of human endometrial stem cells via fluorescent analyzer cell sorter (FACS).

At\nthe molecular levels, FLX increases synaptic availability of\nserotonin [14]. It has been shown that FLX could inhibit\nor activate PI3k/Akt or ERK1/2 pathways depending on the\ncell types and their function [15\u201317]. So it could have a dual\nrole in the cancer therapy and cell therapy in regenerative\nmedicine. For this purpose, we selected the Akt signaling to\ndetermine its role in mesenchymal stem cell proliferation,\ndifferentiation, and survival.\n\nFirst, our in vitro study was conducted to determine the\npossibility of neurogenesis by FLX in the mesenchymal stem\ncell system (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Our results demonstrated\nthat hEnSCs could be induced to differentiate into neurons in\nthe presence of FLX (Figure 2(c)) as was seen in cells treated\nwith retinoic acid (Figure 2(d)). High concentrations of FLX\nhave nonserotoninergic effects on cells [5]. Nonserotonin-\nergic targets of fluoxetine that mediate its other effects are\nlikely to have a lower binding affinity or lower availability for\nFLX. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 is known to be due to a\nnonserotoninergic effect of FLX [18]. Lee et al. (2008) showed\nthat liver cytochrome P450-dependent ROS formation is\nresponsible for cyclin-A downregulation and inhibition of\n\n\n\n6 BioMed Research International\n\nNestin\n\nDAPI DAPI DAPI DAPI\n\n\ud835\udefd-TubulinMAP-2 CD11b\n\n(a)\n\nDAPI DAPI\n\nNestin\n\nDAPI\n\n\ud835\udefd-TubulinMAP-2\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: Immunostaining of hEnSCs differential markers.

However, this induction did not occur in\nthe brain and suggested a tissue-specific response [20]. It\nhas been demonstrated that the SSRIs interact with the eag\nvoltage-gated K\n\n1\nchannel [21], and voltage-gated potassium\n\nchannels play a functional role in the development of human\nneural progenitor cells and differentiation of neurons [22].\nAlso studies by deOliveira and colleagues in 2012 showed that\neag potassium channel expression in the rat hippocampus has\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 7\n\nTreatment after 1 week\n\nMTT of FLX treated SCs\n\nC\nel\n\nl s\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl r\nat\n\ne \n(%\n\n)\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nFigure 6: MTT shows EnSCs differentiated neural cell viability rate\nin the presence of FLX, FLX + LY294002, LY294002, and retinoic\nacid after one week (\ud835\udc43 \u2264 0.05). The numbers from the left side are\nas follows: (1) 1 \ud835\udf07M FLX, (2) 5 \ud835\udf07M FLX, (3) 10 \ud835\udf07M FLX, (4) 10 \ud835\udf07M\nFLX + 10\ud835\udf07M LY294002, (5) 10\ud835\udf07M LY294002, (6) 1\ud835\udf07M retinoic\nacid, (7) neural differentiated cells without FLX supplement, and (8)\nundifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nbeen associated with neural cell survival and transient brain\nischemia [23].\n\nIn our experiment, fluoxetine-induced hEnSCs displayed\nneuronal morphology with axon formation and neurite\noutgrowth and expressed Nestin and other neuronal specific\nmolecular markers by the reverse transcriptase polymerase\nchain reaction (Figure 3) and immunocytochemistry (Fig-\nure 4(a)) assays. EnSCs cultured in serum-free DMEM/F12\nmedium could not differentiate or even proliferated con-\nstantly. These findings indicate FLX-induced EnSCs may\nprovide a stem-cell-based way to generate neuronal cells for\nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This finding\ncould determine that the endometrial stem cells express sero-\ntonin receptors. In neuropharmacology, it may be beneficial\nto study the effect of the different antidepressants on the\nneurogenesis since this provides insights into the regulation\nof stem cell proliferation.\n\nRegeneration of neurons that undergo cell death soon\nafter injury is the main goal of all cell-based therapies. From\nthe point that neurogenesis has the capacity to enhance\nbrain repair and/or spinal cord repair after ischemia and/or\ntrauma by replacement of dead cells or seriously injured cells\nFLX neurogenesis could lead to recovery of these cells. FLX\nwould appear to be a candidate as a neurogenesis factor. Our\nexperiment showed that the hEnSCs expressed neural cell\nmarkers after FLX treatment, but there was no expression of\nCD11b marker that is a specific glial marker (Figure 4(a)).\nThis is an important point because glial scar formation that\noccurs following CNS injuries is an important obstacle of\nneuroregeneration. FLX could introduce a regenerative prod-\nuct in neuronal injuries and find its position in regenerative\npharmacology.\n\nMany groups have examined the potential of neu-\nron replacement from embryonic stem cells [24], induced\npluripotent stem cells (iPS) [25, 26], and cord blood derived\n\nstem cells. Endometrial stem cells have demonstrated supe-\nrior potential. They expand rapidly and they have fewer\ntechnical and ethical problems so they have great potential\nas therapeutic agents and autologous grafts [2]. Our team\nhas previously shown that the endometrial stem cells could\nbe differentiated successfully into other lineages of cells\nespecially neural cells [1, 11]. It represents a progress in the\ndevelopment of a new source of neurons.\n\nWe further confirmed the protective mechanisms of Akt1\nphosphorylation as a survival signaling that introduces this\npathway as a potential target for stem cell survival after dif-\nferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (Figure 6). PI3k/Akt\nis the important cell survival pathways and phosphorylation\nof Akt mediates anti-apoptosis in many kinds of cells [27]. In\n2003, Kim et al. have shown that the Akt activation results in\nphosphorylation and then inactivation of the pro-apoptotic\nprotein glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3b), thus extending\nthe cell survival period [28]. In support of the role of Akt1\nphosphorylation, we found that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002\nin the concentration of 10 \ud835\udf07M decreased the FLX mediated\nAkt phosphorylation (Figure 5), differentiation (Figure 4(b)),\nand the viability of neuronal differentiated cells (Figure 6).\nThis suggests a key role for activating Akt1 in the protection\nof mesenchymal stem cell from the precocious death. Also\nwe have labeled the hEnSCs with BrdU to obtain more exact\ncell proliferation rate (Figure 7(a)). The FLX treated stem\ncells that were labeled with BrdU showed double-staining for\nboth BrdU and Nestin on the 10th day. Cells acquiring Nestin\npositive phenotype seemed to go through cell cycles enough\nto dilute the BrdU label to the non-detectable levels. In our\nexperiment, BrdUwas added on the 8th day of induction, and\nabout half of nestin positive cells carried BrdU-label on the\n10th day (Figure 7(b)). In cultures that FLX was absent about\n70% of Nestin positive cells carried BrdU-label.\n\nIn 2006, Frebel and Wiese confirmed the neuronal sur-\nvival and differentiation implicated PI3-K/AKT in synaptic\nplasticity, learning, and memory in the mammalian brain\n[29].\n\nAlthough this finding supports the neurogenesis role of\nSSRIs, it has been suggested that excessive neurogenesis is\nnot beneficial and could result in inappropriate migration\ninto existing neural networks. Scharfman and Hen believe\nthat this manner could cause some pathological conditions\nas epilepsy [30], but previously Rush et al. reporting that\nSSRIs could lose their effect after long-term use [31]. This\nhas been called relapse during maintenance treatment. A\npossible mechanism underlying this effect is the weakness\nof neurogenesis because of excessive stimulation. So it is\npossible that long-term SSRI therapy might affect PI3/Akt\npathway and its activation that leads to cognitive functions\nby disrupting the normal regulation of neurogenesis.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion our data argue with fluoxetine effect on\nmesenchymal stem cell neurogenesis and its role in the\nphosphorylation of Akt1 in the differentiated cells to increase\nthe survival rate of differentiated cells.\n\n\n\n8 BioMed Research International\n\n(a)\n\nNestin BrdU\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7: Endometrial stem cells labeled by BrdU (a).
