However, clinical studies of human solid tumors have not\nbeen reported to investigate relationship between these proteins.\nMethods: Expression and localization of Kaiso and p120ctn were examined in 196 lung cancer spec-\nimens (including 55 cases of paired lymph node metastases and 80 cases with complete follow-up\nrecords) by immunohistochemistry. Three lung cancer cell lines, BE1, SPC, and A549 were used to estab-\nlish p120ctn stably ablated or overexpressed cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirm\np120ctn bind Kaiso in lung cancer tissue and cell lines. Localization and expression levels of Kaiso were\ndetected via immunofluorescence, cytoplasmic vs. nuclear fractionation Western blot analysis and reverse\ntranscription-polymerase chain reaction.\nResults: Cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was evident in 115 (58.7%), and abnormal p120ctn expression was\nnoted in 168 (85.7%). Cytoplasmic Kaiso and abnormal p120ctn expressions were associated with higher\ndegree of malignancy (high-stage and lymph node metastases, all P < 0.05). Abnormal p120ctn and cyto-\nplasmic Kaiso expressions were higher in matched autologous nodal metastases than in primary growths.\nThe lung cancer-related 5-year survival rate was significantly lower in patients who were cytoplasmic\nKaiso-positive (22.9%; P = 0.029) or abnormal p120ctn expression (20.6%; P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis\nshowed abnormal p120ctn expression was an independent factor defining the clinicopathological char-\nacters of patients. Cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was correlated with cytoplasmic p120ctn, they formed\n\nKaiso\u2013p120ctn complex in lung cancer tissues and cell lines. In addition, p120ctn ablation and overex-\npression altered Kaiso subcellular localization and protein level. Although both isoforms can regulate\nsubcellular localization and protein levels of Kaiso, we found that only p120ctn isoform 3, but not isoform\n1, directly interacts with Kaiso.\nConclusion: p120ctn and Kaiso might co-participate in the progression and lymph node metastasis of lung\n\nexpr\ncancer. p120ctn regulates\n\n. Introduction\n\nIt is known that primary lung cancer is one of the most malig-\nant solid tumors, and that its range of abilities in invasion and\netastasis is very wide. Dysfunction of adhesion molecules and\nmpairment of cell adhesion may be the initial steps of such tumor\nrogression [1\u20133]. Of these molecules, p120-catenin (p120ctn) may\nlay an important role in tumor progression and metastasis due\no its core function in cadherin turnover and cell migration [4\u20139].\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author at: Department of Pathology, College of Basic Medical\nciences and First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, North 2nd Road 92,\neping Ward, Shenyang 110001, China.

All rights reserved.\n\nIn most human tumors, p120ctn levels are reduced or even elimi-\nnated [5]. We have reported previously that abnormal expression\nof p120ctn (reduction of p120ctn isoforms 1 and 3) is associated\nwith lymph node metastasis in lung cancer cells [10\u201312].\n\np120ctn is an Armadillo protein first identified as a prominent\ntyrosine kinase substrate implicated in cell transformation by Src\n[13], and in ligand-induced receptor signaling through various tyro-\nsine kinase receptors [14,15]. p120ctn binds to the juxtamembrane\ndomain (JMD) of E-cadherin [6,16], where it modulates cell\u2013cell\nadhesion by regulating cadherin turnover and stability at the cell\n\nsurface [7\u20139]. Additionally, p120ctn modulates the activities of the\nRhoA, Rac and Cdc42 GTPases, which are the key mediators of\ncytoskeletal organization [17\u201319]. Furthermore, recent evidence\nhas revealed that nuclear p120ctn acts to relieve transcriptional\nrepression mediated by Kaiso, a member of the broad complex,\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcan\nmailto:wangeh@hotmail.com\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2009.06.013\n\n\n2 Cance\n\nt\n[\n\nB\nfi\nv\nd\nd\ns\nb\nt\n[\nd\nm\nn\na\nc\na\nc\nm\n[\np\n\ni\ns\nd\np\nt\nt\nl\ns\ni\ne\np\np\n\nt\nt\np\nw\nc\nf\nm\nt\nt\nK\np\na\n\n2\n\n2\n\na\ni\nC\n1\na\no\np\nf\nO\nA\np\n\n2.2.3. p120ctn cDNA plasmids and transfection\nFollowing Dr. Reynolds\u2019 method [7], mouse p120ctn isoform\n06 S.-D. Dai et al. / Lung\n\nramtrak, bric a\u2019 brac/pox virus and zinc finger family (BTB/POZ)\n20].\n\nKaiso contains an amino-terminal, protein\u2013protein interaction\nTB/POZ domain and a carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding C2H2 zinc\nnger domain [20]. Interaction between p120ctn and Kaiso occurs\nia the Arm repeats 1\u20137 of p120ctn and a noncontiguous Kaiso\nomain flanking the carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding zinc finger\nomain. This close physical juxtaposition of the p120ctn-binding\nite of Kaiso with its DNA-binding motif may explain why DNA\ninding of Kaiso is inhibited by nuclear p120ctn [21,22]. It is shown\nhat nuclear p120ctn can modulate non-canonical Wnt signaling\n23], and, along with T cell factor (TCF)/\ufffd-catenin complexes, coor-\ninately regulate canonical Wnt gene targets such as cyclin D1 and\nmp-7 by Kaiso [24,25]. There is mounting evidence that Kaiso is a\n\nuclear protein that plays a role in transcription repression [23\u201326]\nnd Kaiso is frequently detected in the nuclei of various mammalian\nell lines. However, immunohistochemical study of human normal\nnd tumor tissues show that Kaiso is predominantly localized in the\nytoplasm rather than in cell nuclei. Interestingly, Kaiso\u2019s cytoplas-\nic localization almost always coincided with cytoplasmic p120ctn\n\n27]. Thus, it remains a question that whether Kaiso interacts with\n120ctn in cytoplasm.\n\nThe human p120ctn gene comprises 21 exons, potentially encod-\nng up to 32 protein isoforms as the result of alternative product\nplicing. All p120ctn isoforms share the central Armadillo repeat\nomain but have a divergent N- and C-terminal end [6]. Human\n120ctn isoforms, designated from 1 to 4, differ from each other by\nhe start codon used. In our previous study, we determined that only\nwo isoforms (isoforms 1 and 3) expressed in normal and cancerous\nung tissues [10] and the roles of these two isoforms on invasion are\nomewhat different [28]. Because p120ctn is expressed as multiple\nsoforms with different capacities to bind to the cytoskeleton or to\nnter the nucleus [29\u201332], these isoforms might have a different\notential to modulate the function of Kaiso in vivo. We also try to\nrovide some experimental data to clarify this issue in this study.\n\nTo data, little clinicopathological report has referred to the rela-\nionship between Kaiso and p120ctn expression in human solid\numors. In this study, we examined the expression patterns and\nrognostic significance of p120ctn and Kaiso expression in patients\nith lung cancer. Meanwhile, Kaiso and p120ctn expressions in 55\n\nases of lymph node metastases were probed to investigate dif-\nerences between primary lung cancers and paired lymph node\n\netastases. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to confirm\nhe binding between p120ctn and Kaiso in lung cancer tissues and\nhree lung cancer cell lines. To investigate the effect of p120ctn on\naiso, we depleted total p120ctn expression and overexpressed two\n120ctn isoforms in lung cancer cell lines to evaluate the expression\nnd subcellular localization of Kaiso.\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1. Tissue samples\n\nLung cancer tissues from 196 patients with primary lung cancer\nnd normal from 20 of these patients were obtained follow-\nng surgical resection at the First Clinical College affiliated with\nhina Medical University between 2001 and 2005. Among the\n96 cases, the lymph node metastases of 55 patients were avail-\nble. All patients had not received radiotherapy, chemotherapy\nr immunotherapy before the operation. The average age of the\n\natients was 57.24 years (from 20 to 81 years). The ratio of male to\n\nemale was 1.87:1. Based on the classification of the World Health\nrganization [33] and the TNM stage revised by International Union\ngainst Cancer (UICC) in 2002 [34], we classified the patients with\nrimary lung cancer into the following groups: (1) 81 squamous\nr 67 (2010) 205\u2013215\n\ncell carcinomas, with 27 cases at stage I, 23 cases at stage II, 35\ncases at stage III, and 2 cases at stage IV; 14 cases were highly dif-\nferentiated, 33 cases were moderately differentiated, and 40 cases\nwere undifferentiated; and 49 cases with lymph node metasta-\nsis. (2) 115 adenocarcinomas, with 33 cases at stage I, 23 cases\nat stage II, 48 cases at stage III, and 5 cases at stage IV; 31 cases\nwere highly differentiated, 27 cases were moderately differenti-\nated, and 51 cases were undifferentiated; and 75 cases with lymph\nnode metastasis. A total of 55 samples (24 squamous cell carcino-\nmas, 31 adenocarcinomas) with autologous nodal metastasis were\nused as paired samples to perform immunohistochemical analysis.\n20 cases of tumor samples (including primary cancer and lymph\nnode metastases cancer tissues) were quickly frozen in deep freeze\nrefrigerator until protein extraction. Lymph node status was deter-\nmined by routine pathological examination of dissected pulmonary\nhilar and mediastinal and intrapulmonary lymph nodes. In addi-\ntion, immunohistochemistry was completed on 80 cases of primary\nNSCLC paraffin specimens, which had complete follow-up records.\nThis study was conducted under the regulations of the Institutional\nReview Board of China Medical University. Informed consent was\nobtained prior to surgery from all enrolled patients.\n\n2.2. Cell culture, plasmid construction and transfection\n\n2.2.1. Cell culture\nThe human pulmonary giant cell cancer cell line BE1, which\n\nexpresses high levels of p120ctn, kindly was provided by Dr Jie\nZheng of Department of Pathology, Peking University Health Sci-\nence Center (Beijing, China). Human lung adenocarcinoma cell line\nA549 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection\n(Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), containing 10% fetal calf serum\n(Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), and\n100 IU/ml streptomycin (Sigma).\n\n2.2.2. p120ctn siRNA plasmids and transfection\nFor the production of the p120ctn-siRNA (GeneBank#: 001331)\n\nplasmids used in the experiments, sense and anti-sense oligonu-\ncleotides were annealed and inserted between BamHI and HindIII\nsites of the pGCsi vector by Shanghai GeneChem (Shanghai\nGeneChem Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). The sequences of the three\ndouble-stranded oligonucleotides were as follows:\n\nA: 5\u2032-GGATCACAGTCACCTTCTA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-TAGAAGGTGACTGTGATCC-3\u2032\n\nB: 5\u2032-GCACTTGTATTACAGACAA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-TTGTCTGTAATACAAGTGC-3\u2032\n\nC: 5\u2032-GGATAACAAGATTGCCATA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-TATGGCAATCTTGTTATCC-3\u2032\n\nThe BE1 was stably transfected with the p120ctn-siRNA\nplasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. A non-specific scrambled p120ctn-\nsiRNA plasmid (5\u2032-GG TAG AGA GAC AGT CTC GC-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GC GAG\nACT GTC TCT CTA CC-3\u2032) was used as a negative control. Selec-\ntion was accomplished with G418 (Invitrogen) at a concentration\nof 0.3 mg/ml. Drug-resistant cells were tested for the absence of\np120ctn expression by Western blot and reverse transcription-PCR.\n1A and p120ctn isoform 3A cDNA (a gift from Dr. Reynolds, Van-\nderbilt University, Nashville, USA) were stably transfected using\nLipofectamine 2000 into human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.\nThe stably transfected cells were named A549-1A and A549-3A,\nrespectively. The empty plasmid was used as a negative control.\n\n\n\nCance\n\n2\n\na\nI\ni\nn\nw\n\n2\n\na\nF\nT\na\na\nd\nF\ni\n\nd\nC\nt\na\nt\n4\nc\nc\nA\nw\no\nf\n\u201c\nt\nw\no\nm\nF\nt\n3\nt\nT\na\ns\nn\na\n\n2\n\nv\nw\nm\nm\no\no\nC\nm\nL\n4\nr\no\nj\n(\nS\n\nS.-D.

Meridian Rd., Rockford, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\nnstructions. Antibodies against \ufffd-tubulin (B-7, Santa Cruz Biotech-\nology, Inc.) and Lamin B1 (8D-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)\nere used in control experiments.\n\n.4. Immunohistochemical staining and evaluation\n\nImmunochemistry was performed using the ultrasensitive\nvidin\u2013biotin\u2013peroxidase complex method (Maixin Biotechnology,\nuzhou, Fujian, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nhe antibodies used were mouse anti-human Kaiso monoclonal\nntibody (clone 6F, dilution 1:400, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY, USA)\nnd mouse anti-human p120ctn monoclonal antibody (clone 15D2,\nilution 1:400, BD Transduction Laboratories. Lexington KY, USA).\nor the negative control, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used\nn place of the primary antibodies.\n\nThe percentage of immunoreactive tumor cells was indepen-\nently assessed by two observers (S.D.D and Q.W.) on all sections.\nases with discrepancies were jointly re-evaluated by the inves-\nigators, and a consensus was obtained. Positive samples were\nnalyzed semi-quantitative in at low magnification (\u00d7100) to iden-\nify areas where Kaiso/p120ctn was evenly stained. We counted\n00 tumor cells and calculated the percentage of positively staining\nells. Staining scores were determined by the percentage of positive\nells per slide for membranous and cytoplasmic staining separately.\ns proposed previously [12,35,36], normal expression was defined\nhen over 90% of the tumor cells showed cell membrane staining\n\nf p120ctn. When less than 90% of the tumor cells were stained\nor p120ctn at the cell membrane, the sample was labeled with\nreduced membranous expression\u201d. When more than 10% of the\numor cells stained for cytoplasmic p120ctn expression, the sample\nas labeled with \u201cectopic cytoplasmic expression\u201d. A designation\n\nf either \u201creduced membranous expression\u201d or \u201cectopic cytoplas-\nic expression\u201d was defined as abnormal expression of p120ctn.\n\nor evaluation of the staining of Kaiso in tissue sections, we use\nhe criteria as follows: 0: less than 25%; 1: 26\u201350%; 2: 51\u201375%; and\n: more than 75%. The staining intensity was categorized by rela-\nive intensity as follows: 1 (weak); 2 (intermediate) and 3 (strong).\nhe proportion and intensity scores were then multiplied to obtain\ntotal score. Score less than 1 was considered as negative, while\n\ncores of 2 or more were considered as positive. Cases were scored\nuclear positive when \u22655% of the cells reacted with the anti-Kaiso\nntibody.\n\n.5. Immunofluorescent staining\n\nImmunofluorescent staining was performed as described pre-\niously [10,36]. Briefly, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed\nith ice-cold 100% methanol for 15 min at \u221220 \u25e6C, followed by per-\neabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100. Kaiso was detected using two\nouse monoclonal antibodies (6F and 12H, each at a concentration\n\nf 4 \ufffdg/ml. Upstate, Lake Placid, NY and Santa Cruz Biotechnol-\ngy, Inc. respectively), and a polyclonal antibody (C-18, Santa\nruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and p120ctn was detected using mouse\nonoclonal antibodies (clone 15D2, BD Transduction Laboratories,\n\nexington KY, USA). Primary antibodies were applied overnight at\n\u25e6C followed by incubation with secondary antibody conjugated to\nhodamine/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled at a dilution\nf 1:100 (Beijing Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co. Bei-\n\ning, China). The nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide\nPI, 50 \ufffdg/ml, Sigma)/4, 6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:200,\nigma). The cells were examined with an Olympus IX51 fluorescent\nr 67 (2010) 205\u2013215 207\n\nmicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and images were recorded\nwith a CoolPIX 5400 camera (Nikon, Japan).\n\n2.6. RT-PCR analysis\n\nTotal RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).\ncDNA was prepared using the RNA PCR Kit (AMV) Version\n3.0 (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Dalian, Liaoning, China), according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PCR was carried out with the\nfollowing primers: Kaiso, 5\u2032-TGCCTATTATAACAGAGTCTTT-3\u2032 and\n5\u2032-AGTAGG TGTGATATTTGTTAAAG-3\u2032. p120ctn, 5\u2032-TGCCCTGCTG-\nGATTTGTCTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGAGTGGTCCCATCATCTG-3\u2032. \ufffd-actin, 5\u2032-\nAGAGCTACGAGCTGCCTGAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGTACTTGCGCTCAGGAGGA-\n3\u2032. After electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, the PCR product\nbands were visualized using BioImaging Systems with Labworks\nImage Acquisition and Analysis Software (UVP Inc., Upland, CA,\nUSA). The relative mRNA levels were normalized to the relative\namount of \ufffd-actin mRNA.\n\n2.7. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis\n\nCells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS followed by incuba-\ntion on ice with lysis buffer containing 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM Tris,\n150 Mm NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml leu-\npeptin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mM\nEDTA for 5 min. Cells were harvested from the plates, and trans-\nferred to a 1.5 ml tube. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 g for\n5 min at 4 \u25e6C and the supernatant transferred to a new tube. Lysates\nwere quantified by Bradford assay and equal amounts of total pro-\ntein were used for immunoprecipitation with the anti-p120ctn\n(mAb 15D2, BD Transduction Laboratories. Lexington KY, USA; mAb\n6H11, a gift from Dr. Reynolds, Vanderbilt University, Nashville,\nUSA) or anti-Kaiso pAb (a gift from Dr. Juliet M. Daniel, Department\nof Biology, McMaster University). The immunocomplexes were then\nsubjected to SDS-PAGE.\n\nAfter SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred from the gel to a\nnitrocellulose membrane using the Hoeffer semi-dry transfer appa-\nratus (Amersham/Pharmacia, San Francisco, CA). The membrane\nwas then briefly blocked at room temperature with 3% milk in TBS\npH 7.4 before incubating at 4 \u25e6C overnight with anti-Kaiso mAb (a\ngift from Dr. Juliet M. Daniel, Department of Biology, McMaster Uni-\nversity) used at 2 \ufffdg/ml in 3% milk-TBS. The primary antibodies\nwere removed by washing with TBS and the membranes incu-\nbated for 2 h at RT with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse\nsecondary antibody, diluted 1:40,000 in 3% milk-TBS. Membranes\nwere finally rinsed five times with water, once with TBS pH 7.4 for\n5 min, and processed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)\nsystem (Amersham/Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocols.\n\n2.8.

According to our evaluation criteria,\nhey were judged as negative expression. The positive rate of cyto-\nlasmic Kaiso expression in lung cancer tissue was 58.7% (115/196),\nignificantly higher than that in normal bronchial epithelial cells\nP < 0.001). We also examined the relationship between cytoplas-\n\nic Kaiso expression and clinicopathological factors (Table 1). We\nound that cytoplasmic Kaiso expression occurred more frequently\nn samples with advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis\nP = 0.004, P < 0.001, respectively), while no significant associations\nere found with regard to age, sex, histological type or differen-\n\niation (Table 1). Cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was significantly\nigher in stages II + III + IV lung cancers than in stage I (P = 0.004,\nable 1). In 124 cases with lymph node metastasis, 85 (68.5%)\nhowed cytoplasmic Kaiso expression, and 39 (31.5%) showed no\naiso expression. While in 72 cases without lymph node metasta-\nis, 30 (41.7%) showed cytoplasmic Kaiso expression, and 42 (58.4%)\nhowed no Kaiso expression. There was a significant correlation\netween cytoplasmic Kaiso expression and lymph node metastasis\nP < 0.001, Table 1). Nuclear staining of Kaiso was seen in occa-\nional tumor cells but only with a 5.61% (11/196) positive expression\nate and not associated with any clinicopathological features of\nung cancer (data not shown). In the 55 paired comparison sam-\n\nles, the positive rate of cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was 72.7%\n40/55) in primary sites and 90.9% (50/55) in lymph node metasta-\nis lesions.

(For interpretation of t\nf the article.)\nr 67 (2010) 205\u2013215\n\nExpression of p120ctn occurs mainly in the cell membrane of\nnormal bronchial epithelium (Fig. 1C). Of 196 lung cancers, 28\n(14.29%) showed normal or preserved membranous expression\nonly, and 168 (85.71%) showed abnormal expression, includ-\ning reduced membranous expression, preserved membranous\nexpression accompanied with ectopic cytoplasmic expression,\nand reduced or absent membranous expression together with\nectopic cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 2A and E). Next, we examined\nassociations between abnormal expression of p120ctn and clini-\ncopathological factors (Table 1). We found that abnormal p120ctn\nexpression occurred more frequently in samples with advanced\ntumor stage and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.016, P < 0.001, respec-\ntively), while no significant association was found with regard to\nage, sex, histological type and differentiation (Table 1).\n\nThe expression of p120ctn in the 55 cases for which paired data\nwere available is summarized in Table 2. Abnormal p120ctn expres-\nsion (reduced membranous expression and/or ectopic cytoplasmic\nexpression) was detected in 81.8% (45/55) of primary sites and\n96.36% (53/55) in the lymph node metastases. Lymph node metas-\ntases showed significantly higher abnormal p120ctn expression,\ncompared to primary tumors (P = 0.002) (Table 2B).\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2, Kaiso and p120ctn often exhibited cytoplas-\nmic co-localization not only in primary lesions but also in lympha\nnode metastases. The immunohistochemical staining results of\nconsecutive sections showed that p120ctn ectopic cytoplasmic\nexpression frequently accompanied with cytoplasmic Kaiso expres-\nsion. We confirmed this observation widely existed in lung cancer\ntissues regardless of clinical and histological features (such as\nhistological type and lymph node metastasis status). Next, we car-\n\nried out statistic analysis to confirm the significantly relationship\nbetween cytoplasmic Kaiso expression and ectopic cytoplasmic\np120ctn expression. Of 196 primary lung cancers, cytoplasmic Kaiso\nexpression correlates with ectopic cytoplasmic p120ctn expression\n(Kappa = 0.269, P < 0.001; Table 2A). The same was true for pri-\n\ncells.

Discussion\n\nKaiso is a nuclear protein that plays a role in transcription\n\nrepression [23\u201325,37,38]. It belongs to the BTB/POZ (Broad Com-\nplex, Tramtrak, Bric a\u2019 brac/Pox virus and Zinc finger) family\nof proteins [39].

Among the BTB/POZ proteins, Kaiso appears to be\nnique in possessing dual specificity, recognizing both sequence-\npecific consensus sites and methylated CpG dinucleotides\n21,41\u201343].\n\nIn this study, we found that cytoplasmic Kaiso expression corre-\nate with ectopic cytoplasmic p120ctn expression in lung cancer\ny immunohistochemistry. Next, co-immunoprecipitation assay\nlearly confirmed that Kaiso and p120ctn coassociated with each\nther in cytoplasm of lung cancer cells. Immunohistochemical\ntudy demonstrated that all 13 lung cancer tissues utilized in the co-\nmmunoprecipitation assay only with synergistically cytoplasmic\naiso and p120ctn expression. No nuclear staining can be detected\n\nn these tissues. This is apparently the only report directly reveals\naiso\u2013p120ctn complex exists in cytoplasm.\n\nThe relationships between the expression of p120ctn and Kaiso,\ns well as their correlation with clinical and pathological factors of\nancer, are poorly defined [44,45]. Herein, we found that Kaiso cyto-\nlasmic expression and p120ctn abnormal expression were more\npparent in tumors with higher degree of malignancy (high-stage,\nodal metastasis) and significantly correlated with poor progno-\nis of the patients. Moreover, immunohistochemical results of 55\naired cases of lung cancer demonstrated that abnormal p120ctn\nxpression and cytoplasmic Kaiso expression were significantly\nigher in lymph node metastasis than that in primary cancer. In\nddition, Cox model multivariate analysis reveals that abnormal\n120ctn expression is the major and independent factors defin-\n\nng the clinicopathological characters of patients while cytoplasmic\naiso may be an independent factor affecting prognosis, with a P-\nalue of 0.062. It seems important to collect more patient follow-up\necords to clarify this correlation between Kaiso expression and\npatient\u2019s clinical response. Kaiso may exert an oncogenic func-\n\nion in the cytoplasm of lung cancer cells. It may therefore be\northwhile in the future to analyze the effect of Kaiso on cell\nroliferation and transformation by Kaiso overexpression or knock-\nown. Our p120ctn knockdown results obtained from SPC cells\n\nsiRNA-SPC) showed that p120ctn ablation increased Kaiso local-\nzation in nucleus, suggesting p120ctn takes part in Kaiso export\nrom nucleus. It has been reported that no nuclear export signals\nNES) existed in Kaiso while two NES presented in p120ctn [46].\nonsidering the close relationship between Kaiso and p120ctn,\nxtract, compare to A549 cells. Lower, p120ctn mAb 6H11, which recognize only the\nforms of p120ctn, coprecipitated Kaiso from whole cell lysates. (For interpretation\nthe article.)\n\nit is plausible that p120ctn participates in Kaiso exit from the\nnucleus. A functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) is present\nupstream of the zinc finger domain in Kaiso and Kaiso enters the\nnucleus by the classical importin-\ufffd/\ufffd pathway [26]. However, it is\nstill unknown whether p120ctn plays a role in the entry of Kaiso\ninto the nucleus. Our data obtained from p120ctn knockdown BE1\ncells (siRNA-BE1) suggested that p120ctn could assist the entry\nof Kaiso into the nucleus. We also noticed that results got from\nthese two cell lines were somewhat contradictory. This discrep-\nancy may be due to different cell lines employed in this study, most\nlikely the initial p120ctn levels. As shown in Fig. 5B, BE1 cell lines\nexpress high levels of p120ctn (more isoform 1 than isoform 3) and\nSPC cell lines express middle levels of p120ctn (more isoform 3\nthan isoform 1). The details still need us to address in our future\nresearch.\n\nThe results got from stably overexpressed p120ctn isoforms 1A\nand 3A cells (designated A549-1A and A549-3A cells) demonstrate\nthat both of these two isoforms overexpression could increase Kaiso\nexpression in cytoplasm and nucleus. But difference also can be\nfound, p120ctn isoform 3 seems exert more effort on Kaiso\u2019s sub-\ncellular localization. Our binding studies further suggest that only\np120ctn isoform 3 directly binds to Kaiso. This result consistents\nwith report by Daniel and Reynolds [20]. In that study, they found\nthat Kaiso might only directly bind with p120ctn isoform 3 but\ndid not absolute exclude the possible binding between Kaiso and\np120ctn isoform 1, for cell lines employed in their study express\nvery low levels of p120ctn isoform 1. This possible interaction can\nbe eliminated by our result of co-immunoprecipitation assay, for\np120ctn isoform 1 had been significantly upregulated in A549-\n1A cells. How p120ctn isoform 1 affects the localization of Kaiso,\nalthough they did not directly interact, is an interesting problem to\nclarify.\n\nOur study showed that p120ctn depletion or overexpression did\nnot influence Kaiso transcription, but did influence Kaiso protein\nexpression. These results demonstrate that p120ctn only regulates\nKaiso at the protein level, rather than by affecting Kaiso gene tran-\n\nscription. Park et al. [47] have demonstrated that Frodo depletion\n(Frodo-morpholino [Frodo-MO] injection) resulted in significantly\ndecreased p120ctn levels, while, in contrast, the amount of Kaiso\nprotein remained unchanged. This apparently contradictory find-\nings of two different studies could be explained by the fact that,\n\n\n\n2 Cance\n\ni\nc\nm\n[\n\n5\n\np\no\ns\nm\na\no\nu\np\nK\n\nC\n\nr\n\nA\n\nc\n1\nt\nU\nc\n\nS\nW\n\nR\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n14 S.-D.

Conclusion\n\nOur data showed that abnormal p120ctn expression and cyto-\nlasmic Kaiso expression significantly correlated to higher degree\nf malignancy (high-stage, nodal metastasis) and poor progno-\nis of the NSCLC patients. Abnormal p120ctn expression is the\najor and independent factor defining the clinicopathological char-\n\ncters of patients. Kaiso\u2013p120ctn complex exists in cytoplasm\nf lung cancer cells. Although both p120ctn isoforms can reg-\nlate subcellular localization and protein levels of Kaiso, only\n120ctn isoform 3, but not isoform 1, directly interacts with\naiso.\n\nonflict of interest statement\n\nNone of the authors of this manuscript have a financial interest\nelated to this work.\n\ncknowledgement\n\nWe sincerely thank Dr. Albert B.
