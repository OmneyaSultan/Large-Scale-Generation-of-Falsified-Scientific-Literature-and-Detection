Although\nIL-13 through its binding to IL-4 receptor a (IL-4Ra/IL-13Ra1 uses the canonical signal transducer and\nactivator of transcription 6 (STAT6)-signaling pathway to mediate these tissue responses, recent studies\nhave demonstrated that other signaling pathways may also be involved in. In the present study, whether\nIL-13 induces an activation of nuclear factor (NF)-jB, inflammatory transcription factor, was investigated\nin human bronchial smooth muscle cells (hBSMCs). Methods: Nuclear proteins were extracted from cul-\ntured hBSMCs treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a (10 ng/mL) or IL-13 (100 ng/mL), and assayed\nfor activated NF-jB and STAT6 by Western blotting. Result: Treatments with TNF-a and IL-13 induced a\ntranslocation of NF-jB to nuclei in hBSMCs. In addition, coincubation with BMS-345541 (0.3 lM), an\ninhibitor of NF-jB (IjB) kinase (IKK) inhibitor, markedly inhibited the translocation of NF-jB. Conclusion:\nOur results suggest for the first time that IL-13 activates NF-jB in hBSMCs.\n\n\ufffd 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nT helper 2 (Th2) cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and\nIL-13 are important mediators of bronchial asthma, a complex\nchronic disease of the airways, which is characterized by airway\ninflammation, airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness\n(AHR). In murine models of the asthmatic response, IL-13 has been\nshown to be both necessary and sufficient for the generation of\nasthma-like deleterious tissue alterations [1\u20134]. The mechanisms\nof these responses have not been fully defined. However, because\nIL-13 induces a greater number of genes in airway smooth muscle\nas compared with other lung cell types, including smooth muscle\nmyosin light chain (MLC), phospholipase A2 and IL-13 receptor\na1 (IL-13Ra1), airway smooth muscle cells have the capacity to re-\nspond to direct stimulation by IL-13 [5].\n\nIL-13 binds to a polymeric receptor that contains IL-4Ra and IL-\n13Ra1 subunits. The majority of the studies of this receptor have\nfocused on its ability to induce signal transducer and activator of\ntranscription 6 (STAT6) tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent\nsignaling. In murine models, IL-13 has been shown to mediate\nmany of its asthma-relevant responses through the activation of\nthe STAT6 pathway in bronchial epithelial cells [6]. However, other\nsignal transduction pathways also contribute to the pathogenesis\nof asthma-like Th2 responses including airway hyperresponsive-\nll rights reserved.\nness and inflammation [7,8]. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase\n(ERK) 1/2 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation is re-\nquired for optimal IL-13 stimulation of specific chemokines, matrix\nmetalloproteinases (MMPs), and protease inhibitors in the murine\nlung [9].\n\nThe nuclear transcription factor NF-jB, typical of p50 and p65\nheterodimer, regulates over 150 genes involved in immune and\ninflammatory responses. Current evidence suggests an essential\nrole in NF-jB overactivation for increased expression of many\ninflammatory genes and for airway inflammation in asthma\n[9,10]. One well established mechanism of NF-jB suppression is\nthe export of nuclear NF-jB by inhibitor of NF-jB (IjB) a, thereby\nrapidly repressing NF-jB activation [11]. In general, NF-jB has\nbeen known to be activated through phosphorylation and degrada-\ntion of IjBa by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. However, it is re-\nported that NF-jB is activated by not only TNF-a but also IL-1b,\nUV-light and stress and has an important role in the immune re-\nsponse including inflammation [12\u201314].\n\nWe hypothesized that NF-jB plays a critical role in the patho-\ngenesis of IL-13-induced signal transduction. To test this hypothe-\nsis, we investigated whether IL-13 induces an activation of NF-jB\nin human bronchial smooth muscle cells (hBSMCs). As the results,\nboth TNF-a and IL-13 induced activations of NF-jB and STAT6,\nrespectively. Interestingly, IL-13 also induced an activation of NF-\njB, which was demonstrated by the NF-jB translocation to nuclei.\nThese phenomena were significantly inhibited by combination\nwith BMS-345541, IjB kinase (IKK) inhibitor. Therefore, our results\n\nmailto:chiba@hoshi.ac.jp\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\nK.

Chemicals\n\nAll biochemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased\nfrom commercial suppliers: rhTNF-a (Peprotech, Paris, France),\nrhIL-13 (Peprotech, Paris, France) and BMS-345541 (Sigma, MO,\nUSA).\n\n2.2. Cell culture\n\nHuman bronchial smooth muscle cells (hBSMCs, Cambrex, MD,\nUSA) were maintained in SmBM (Cambrex) medium supplemented\nwith 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mg/mL hFGF-B, 0.5 mg/mL\nhEGF, 5 mg/mL insulin and gentamycin/amphotericin B. The cells\nplated at a density of 2.7 \ufffd 104 per one well of a 6-well dish in\nFBS. Cells were serum deprived for 24 h using serum-free medium,\nwhich consists of SmBM supplemented with gentamycin/ampho-\ntericin B. The culture technique was used in experiments involving\nstimulation with 10 ng/mL TNF-a, 100 ng/mL IL-13 or sterile phos-\nphate buffered saline (PBS) as vehicle control for 30 min or 1 h.\nBMS-345541, IKK inhibitor, was coincubated with TNF-a or IL-13.\n\n2.3.

Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation\nat 14,000g for 20 s at 4 \ufffdC. Proteins were extracted from nuclei by\nincubation at 4 \ufffdC with vigorous vortexing in buffer (420 mM NaCl,\n20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM\nDTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2.5 lg/ml leupeptin, and 5 lg/ml aprotinin).\nNuclear debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000g for\n30 min at 4 \ufffdC, and the supernatant extract was collected and\nstored at \u201385 \ufffdC until use.\n\n2.4. Western blot analyses\n\nTo determine the levels of p65 in nucleus of hBSMCs and the\nphosphorylated levels of STAT6 in hBSMCs, the samples (10 mg\nof total protein per lane) were subjected to 10 or 7.5% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE),\nand the proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a\npoly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. After blocking with\n3% skim milk or 3% gelatin, the PVDF membrane was incubated\nwith polyclonal rabbit anti-NF-jB p65 (1:1000 dilution; Biolegend,\nSan Diego, CA, USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-STAT6 (1:1000 dilution;\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA), or polyclonal rabbit anti-\nphosphorylated STAT6 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz).\nThen the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-\nconjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500 dilution; Amersham\nBiosciences, Co., NJ, USA), detected by an enhanced chemilumines-\ncent system (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by a densitom-\netry system. Detection of house-keeping gene was also performed\non the same membrane by using polyclonal rabbit anti-histone H1\n(1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz), or monoclonal mouse anti-b-actin\n(1:5000 dilution; Santa Cruz) to confirm the same amount of pro-\nteins loaded.\n***\n\nt       IL-13\n(100 ng/mL)\n\n   TNF-\n(10 ng/mL)\n\nced by TNF-a (10 ng/mL, 1 h) or IL-13 (100 ng/mL, 1 h) in cultured human bronchial\nted STAT6 by immunoblottings.

A value of p < 0.05 was considered as significant.\n\n3. Result\n\nTo determine whether TNF-a and IL-13 are capable of activating\nSTAT6 and NF-jB in hBSMCs, the levels of STAT6 phosphorylation\nand nuclear translocation of p65 were assessed by\nimmunoblottings.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, IL-13 caused distinct phosphorylation of\nSTAT6 in the hBSMCs: the level of phosphorylated STAT6 in the\nIL-13 (100 ng/mL)-treated cells was significantly increased as com-\npared with that in the vehicle-treated control cells (p < 0.001). On\nthe other hand, TNF-a (10 ng/mL) had no effect on the level of\nSTAT6 phosphorylation (Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 2 shows the effects of TNF-a and IL-13 on the level of nucle-\nar p65 in hBSMCs. As widely reported in various types of cells, TNF-\na (10 ng/mL) caused a significant increase in nuclear p65 level\n(Fig. 2; p < 0.01), i.e., translocation of p65 to nuclei, in hBSMCs.\nInterestingly, a significant increase in nuclear p65 was also ob-\nserved in the cells treated with 100 ng/mL of IL-13 (Fig. 2;\np < 0.05), suggesting that IL-13 is capable of activating not only\nSTAT6 but also NF-jB in hBSMCs.\n\nNext, the effect of an IjB kinase (IKK) inhibitor, BMS-345541, on\nthe IL-13-induced translocation of p65 was investigated to deter-\nmine the role of IKK in the IL-13-induced activation of NF-jB. As\nshown in Fig. 3, the TNF-a-induced translocation of p65 was com-\npletely blocked by BMS-345541 (0.3 lM; p < 0.01).

Discussion\n\nIL-13 is a Th2 cytokine that has emerged as a critical regulator\nof inflammatory immune responses, with key roles in asthma\nand parasite immunity [15,16]. IL-13 can be detected in the bron-\nchial tissue [17], nasal lavage fluid [18], and induced sputum [17]\nof asthmatics. Following segmental allergen challenge, bronchoal-\nveolar lavage (BAL) fluid contains IL-13 mRNA [19] and IL-13 pro-\ntein [20], indicating that the cytokine is generated in the lung in\nresponse to respiratory provocation. Transgene pulmonary overex-\npression of IL-13 in mice is associated with several key pathologi-\ncal features of airways inflammation and remodeling, also\nobserved in patients with chronic severe asthma, including lym-\nphocyte and eosinophil accumulation, mucus cell metaplasia, sub-\nepithelial fibrosis and AHR [1]. Several studies indicate that IL-13\nmay cause AHR independently of inflammation and it is plausible\nthat the effect may result from a direct effect on airway smooth\nmuscle (ASM). ASM cells express functional IL-13 receptors and\nIL-13 is also linked to an augmented ASM contractility in rabbit\ntracheal strips [21,22].\n\nIL-13 first binds to the IL-13Ra1 chain on the surface of cells. IL-\n4Ra is recruited upon IL-13 interaction with IL-13Ra1, to form the\nhigh affinity receptor complex [23]. Heterodimerization of cell sur-\nface IL-13Ra1 and IL-4Ra receptor chains initiates IL-13 signaling\nvia recruitment of janus kinase (JAK) 1, JAK2 and tyrosine kinase\n(Tyk) 2, resulting in the phosphorylation of STAT6, a critical step\nin IL-13 and IL-4 dependent signaling [24].\n\nThe present study demonstrated for the first time that not only\nTNF-a (10 ng/mL) but also IL-13 (100 ng/mL) induces translocation\np65\n\nHistone H1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nN\nuc\n\nle\nar\n\n p\n65\n\n / \nH\n\nis\nto\n\nne\n H\n\n1\n\nCont      IL-13\n(100 ng/mL)\n\n   TNF-\n(10 ng/mL)\n\n- + -- +BMS-345541 (0.3 \u00b5M)\n-\n+\n\n***\n\n*\n\n++ #\n\nFig. 3.

Putative mechanisms of activation of signal transducer and activator of\ntranscription 6 (STAT6) and NF-jB by IL-13 and TNF-a in hBSMCs. The current\nfindings suggest that, in addition to the activation of STAT6 pathway, IL-13 also\nactivate NF-jB via an activation of IjB kinase (IKK, although the signaling between\nIL-13 receptors and IKK is not yet clear now.\n\nK. Goto et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 96\u201399 99\nof NF-jB to nuclei in hBSMCs. A complex composed of IKKs (IKKa,\nIKKb and IKKc) is an essential component in NF-jB-signaling\nmechanisms participating in IjBa phosphorylation. Although IKKa\nand IKKb are catalytic subunits, IKKc is a regulatory subunit. IKKb\nis essential for activation of the classical NF-jB pathway through\nphosphorylation of serine residues 32 and 36 of IjBa, resulting\nin the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IjBa by the\n26S proteasome. The degradation of IjBa exposes a nuclear trans-\nlocation sequence facilitating translocation of NF-jB to the nu-\ncleus. In spite of treatment with TNF-a or IL-13, the expression\nof total cellular p65 failed to show any change. Therefore, it is\nour judgment that upregulation of p65 in nuclei occurred by trans-\nlocation of NF-jB. Svetlana et al. [25] had demonstrated an activa-\ntion of NF-jB in mice when IL-13 was overexpressed in lung\nepithelia. In addition, Il-13-induced eosinophilia, inflammation,\nfibrosis, airway obstruction and alveolar remodeling were inhib-\nited by interference with NF-jB activation [25]. In our works, IL-\n13 also activated NF-jB, and IL-13-induced translocation of NF-\njB to nuclei was completely inhibited by BMS-345541 (0.3 lM),\nIKK inhibitor in hBSMCs. Because the TNF-a induced activation of\nNF-jB is dependent on IKKb, we suggested that BMS-345541\n(0.3 lM) was perfectly inhibited IKK activity. Therefore, our result\nindicated that IL-13 activates NF-jB via IKKb.\n\nIn conclusion, we suggest for the first time that IL-13 activates\nNF-jB via an activation of IKK in hBSMCs (Fig. 4). Therefore, be-\ncause the inhibition of NF-jB activity suppressed not only TNF-a\ninduced signaling but also IL-13 induced signaling partly, NF-jB\ninhibitor can be a therapeutic target for bronchial asthma.\nReferences\n\n[1] Zhu Z, Homer RJ, Wang Z, Chen Q, Geba GP, Wang J, et al.
