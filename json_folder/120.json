Here we have investigated the\nrole of these proteins in biofilm formation, virulence\nfactor synthesis and virulence of P. aeruginosa. Muta-\ntion of PA4108 and PA4781 led to an increase in the\nlevel of cyclic-di-GMP in P. aeruginosa, consistent\nwith the predicted activity of the encoded proteins as\ncyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterases. Mutation of both\ngenes led to reduced swarming motility but had dif-\nfering effects on production of the virulence factors\npyocyanin, pyoverdin and ExoS. Mutation of PA2572\nhad no effect on cyclic-di-GMP levels and did not\ninfluence swarming motility. However, PA2572 had a\nnegative influence on swarming that was cryptic and\nwas revealed only after removal of an uncharacter-\nized C-terminal domain. Mutation of PA4108, PA4781\nand PA2572 had distinct effects on biofilm formation\nand architecture of P. aeruginosa. All three proteins\ncontributed to virulence of P. aeruginosa to larvae of\nthe Greater Wax moth Galleria mellonella.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe nucleotide cyclic di-GMP [bis-(3\u2032-5\u2032)-cyclic di-\nguanosine monophosphate] is a second messenger in\nbacteria that regulates a range of functions including\n\ndevelopmental transitions, polysaccharide synthesis,\nadhesion, biofilm formation, the synthesis of virulence\nfactors and virulence in bacterial pathogens (R\u00f6mling\net al., 2005; Jenal and Malone, 2006; Ryan et al., 2006a;\nCotter and Stibitz, 2007). The level of cyclic di-GMP in\nbacterial cells is influenced by both synthesis and degra-\ndation. The GGDEF protein domain synthesizes cyclic\ndi-GMP, whereas EAL and HD-GYP domains are involved\nin cyclic di-GMP hydrolysis (Paul et al., 2004; Christen\net al., 2005; Ryjenkov et al., 2005; Schmidt et al., 2005;\nTamayo et al., 2005; Ryan et al., 2006b). GGDEF and\nEAL domains were first linked to cyclic di-GMP turnover\nthrough studies of the regulation of cellulose synthesis in\nGluconacetobacter xylinus (Tal et al., 1998). Subse-\nquently, a number of reports have described the role of\nGGDEF/EAL domain proteins in the control of different\ncellular functions in diverse bacteria and the enzymatic\nactivity of the two domains has been established. In con-\ntrast, comparatively little is known about the role of\nHD-GYP domain proteins in bacteria, although bioinfor-\nmatic studies indicate that genes encoding proteins with\nthis domain occur in many genomic sequences represent-\ning all major classes of bacteria (Galperin, 2005).\n\nStudies of the function and role of the HD-GYP domain\nhave thus far focused on the regulatory protein RpfG from\nthe plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris. RpfG is\nrequired for full virulence of X. campestris and acts to\npositively regulate the synthesis of virulence factors such\nas extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccha-\nride, positively regulate motility, but negatively regulate\nadherence and biofilm formation (Slater et al., 2000; Dow\net al., 2003; Crossman and Dow, 2004; Dow et al., 2006;\nRyan et al., 2007). The isolated HD-GYP domain of RpfG\ncan hydrolyse cyclic di-GMP to GMP via a linear interme-\ndiate (Ryan et al., 2006b). Mutation of the HD residues\ncomprising the presumed catalytic diad of the HD-GYP\ndomain abolishes both the regulatory activity and enzy-\nmatic activity against cyclic di-GMP (Ryan et al., 2006b).\n\nThe work in this paper had the overall aim of broaden-\ning our understanding of the cellular function of HD-GYP\ndomain proteins by examination of their role in the human\npathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The P. aeruginosa\ngenome encodes two proteins (PA4108, PA4781) with an\nHD-GYP domain and a third protein PA2572, which con-\ntains a variant HD-GYP domain (specifically YN-GYP). It\nis not known whether all three proteins are capable of\n\nReceived 4 September, 2008; accepted 5 November, 2008. *For\ncorrespondence. E-mail m.dow@ucc.ie; Tel.

The expression of PA4108,\nPA4781 and PA2572 is substantially increased during\nco-culture of P. aeruginosa with human epithelial cells\n(Ichikawa et al., 2000; Chugani and Greenberg, 2007)\nand PA2572 and PA4781 are induced by mucopurulent\nfluid from cystic fibrosis patients (Wolfgang et al., 2004).\nThese observations raise the question as to whether\nthese proteins act to regulate factors associated with the\nvirulence of P. aeruginosa, an issue we address here. Our\nfindings indicate that PA4108 and PA4781 are cyclic\ndi-GMP phosphodiesterases that regulate the synthesis\nand/or secretion of the virulence determinants pyocyanin,\npyoverdin and ExoS as well as having a positive effect on\nswarming. In contrast, PA2572, which is inactive in cyclic\ndi-GMP hydrolysis, has a cryptic negative influence on\nswarming. Mutations of PA4108, PA4781 and PA2572\nhave distinct effects on the synthesis of different virulence\ndeterminants and on biofilm formation and architecture\nbut all mutants have reduced virulence to larvae of the\nGreater Wax Moth Galleria mellonella.\n\nResults\n\nDomain organization of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781\n\nThe HD-GYP domain in PA2572 and PA4781 is found\nin association with an N-terminal CheY-like response\nreceiver (REC) regulatory domain. PA2572 additionally\nhas an uncharacterized C-terminal extension that is\nabsent from PA4781 and from RpfG of X. campestris.\nPA4108 has an HD-GYP domain with additional\nN-terminal and C-terminal domains that are uncharacter-\nized. The presence of the REC domain suggests that\nPA2572 and PA4781 are elements within two component\nregulatory systems. Although PA2572 is adjacent to a\ngene (PA2571) encoding a sensor kinase, no gene encod-\ning a sensor kinase is found within the genomic vicinity of\nPA4781, which appears therefore to be an \u2018orphan\u2019\nregulator.\n\nAnalysis of the enzymatic activities of the HD-GYP\ndomains of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 by expression\nin Xanthomonas campestris\n\nAs outlined in Introduction, mutation of rpfG in X. campes-\ntris leads to a substantial reduction in the synthesis of the\nextracellular enzymes endoglucanase, endomannanase\nand protease. Expression of the isolated HD-GYP domain\nof RpfG in the rpfG mutant background restores enzyme\nproduction to near wild-type levels. This effect, which is\nalso seen with this domain carrying a C-terminal His6 tag,\ndepends upon the HD diad and the ability to degrade\ncyclic di-GMP (Ryan et al., 2006b). Expression in the\n\nX. campestris rpfG mutant was used to analyse the enzy-\nmatic activities of the isolated HD-GYP domains of\nPA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 that had C-terminal His6\ntags. HD-GYP domains from both PA4108 and PA4781\nwere able to restore production of endoglucanase,\nendomannanase and protease towards wild-type levels\n(Fig. 1A\u2013C). In contrast, no effect was seen with the\nYN-GYP domain of PA2572 (Fig. 1A\u2013C). Western analy-\nsis with antisera against the His6 tag showed that all the\ndomains were expressed (Fig. 1D).\n\nThe effects of expression of the various HD-GYP\ndomains on the cellular level of cyclic di-GMP in\nX. campestris were also determined. The levels of the\nnucleotide were elevated in the rpfG mutant compared\nwith the wild-type X. campestris strain 8004 (Fig. 2;\nFig. S1). Expression of the HD-GYP domains of RpfG,\nPA4108 and PA4781 caused a reduction in the level,\nalthough expression of the YN-GYP domain of PA2572\nhad no effect (Fig. 2). The absence of any effect with the\nYN-GYP variant domain suggested that this does not\nhave any enzymatic activity against cyclic di-GMP. This\ncontention was further examined by assessment of the\neffects of alteration of the conserved H231 and D232\nresidues of RpfG to Y and N residues respectively. These\nchanges (H231Y, D232N) were introduced by site-\ndirected mutagenic PCR into the construct expressing\nHD-GYPHis6 (see Experimental procedures). Western\nanalysis with antisera against the His6 tag showed that\nthe variant protein was expressed to the same level as the\nwild-type (Fig. S2). However, these alterations in the HD\ndiad eliminated the regulatory activity of the HD-GYPHis6\ndomain in restoring extracellular enzyme synthesis\n(Fig. S2).\n\nTaken together, these findings suggest that the\nHD-GYP domains of PA4108 and PA4781 have cyclic\ndi-GMP phosphodiesterase activity but that the YN-GYP\ndomain of PA2572 is inactive. Unfortunately, it was not\npossible to purify sufficient protein to examine these pro-\nposed enzymatic activities directly.\n\nPhenotypic effects of mutation of genes encoding\nHD-GYP domain proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nSpecific disruption of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 was\ncarried out using pEX18-Gm as described in Experimen-\ntal procedures. The mutant strains were tested for the\ncellular level of cyclic di-GMP and for production of factors\nor phenotypes that have been associated with P. aerugi-\nnosa virulence. Mutation of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781\nhad no effect on growth in minimal M9 medium or\ncomplex LB medium. Mutation of PA4108 and PA4781\ngave rise to increased levels of cyclic di-GMP (Fig. 3),\nconsistent with the role of the HD-GYP domain in cyclic\ndi-GMP degradation. In contrast, there was no discernible\n\nHD-GYP domain proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1127\n\n\u00a9 2008 The Authors\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2008 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 11, 1126\u20131136\n\n\n\ndifference in the level of cyclic di-GMP between the\nPA2572 mutant and the wild-type (Fig. 3). Introduction of\nthe PA4108 and PA4781 genes cloned in pBBRMCS1-Cm\ninto the appropriate mutants reduced cyclic di-GMP levels\nto wild-type (Fig. 3).\n\nMutation of PA4108 and PA4781 led to reduction in both\nswarming and twitching motility (Fig. 4C and data not\nshown), whereas mutation of PA2572 had no effect on\neither form of motility. All strains showed wild-type swim-\nming motility. Introduction of PA4108 and PA4781 genes\ninto the appropriate mutants restored wild-type swarming\nand twitching motility (Fig. 4C and data not shown).\n\nMutation of PA4108, PA4781 and PA2572 had different\neffects on the production of the phenazine, pyocyanin, the\nsiderophore pyoverdine and rhamnolipid (Fig. 4; Fig. S3).\nMutation of PA4781 led to an increase in pyoverdine\n\nproduction, whereas mutation of PA2572 led to a reduc-\ntion and mutation of PA4108 had no significant effect\n(Fig. 4A). In contrast, only mutation of PA4108 had a\nsignificant effect on pyocyanin production, which was\nreduced compared with wild-type (Fig. 4B). The produc-\ntion of rhamnolipid was elevated in the PA2572 mutant but\nwas at wild-type level in both the PA4108 and PA4781\nmutant strains (Fig. S3). Mutation of PA4108 but not\nPA2572 or PA4781 led to reduction in the extracellular\nlevels of the Type III-secreted effector ExoS (Fig. 5A).\nIntroduction of the cloned PA4108 into the PA4108 mutant\nrestored ExoS levels to wild-type (Fig. 5B). Overall, these\nresults indicated that PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 have\ndistinct regulatory effects on production of certain viru-\nlence factors in P. aeruginosa, although PA4108 and\nPA4781 have the same influence on motility.\n\nFig. 1. Analysis of the ability of the HD-GYP domains of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 to regulate of production of extracellular enzymes in\nX. campestris. DNA encoding the different HD-GYP domains with a C-terminal His6 tag was cloned into pLAFR3 and constructs introduced\ninto the rpfG mutant of X. campestris. The relative level of mannanase (A) and endoglucanase (B) in culture supernatants of different bacterial\nstrains was measured after growth in NYGB medium to an OD at 600 nm of 2.0 and compared with that of the wild-type X. campestris strain\n8004. Values given are the means and standard errors of triplicate measurements. (C) The relative level of protease production was assessed\nby zones of clearing around bacterial colonies grown on skimmed milk agar plates. The HD-GYP domain of PA4108 and PA4781 but not\nPA2572 restored production of the three enzyme activities to near levels of the X. campestris wild-type strain 8004. Western blot analysis with\nan anti-His6 antiserum (D) showed that all protein domains were expressed in X. campestris.

P. Ryan et al.\n\n\u00a9 2008 The Authors\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2008 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 11, 1126\u20131136\n\n\n\nMutations of genes encoding different HD-GYP domain\nproteins have distinct effects on biofilm formation in\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nThe effect of mutation of PA4108, PA4781 and PA2572 on\nbiofilm formation in P. aeruginosa was assessed using\nbacteria growing in flow cells (see Experimental proce-\ndures). In FAB medium, wild-type P. aeruginosa devel-\noped characteristic mushroom structures with a stalk and\ncap (Fig. 6A). The PA2572 mutant formed similar struc-\ntures, but unlike the wild-type, had central hollowing of the\nstalk with a region that was devoid of bacteria, as seen by\nstaining with either the live stain Syto9 (Fig. 6B) or dead\nstain propidium iodide (data not shown). The PA4108\nmutant produced a flatter biofilm than wild-type with\nsmaller mushroom structures and reduced biomass\n(Fig. 6C; Fig. S4E). The PA4781 mutant produced a\nbiofilm with little heterogeneity that covered a large\npercentage of the surface and encompassed a few\nmushroom-like structures (Fig. 6D). Introduction of cloned\nPA2572, PA4108 or PA4781 genes into the appropriate\nmutant strains restored the formation of mushroom struc-\ntures similar to those of the wild-type in each case\n(Fig. S4). These differences in architecture of the biofilms\nformed by the different mutants provide further support for\nthe notion that PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 have distinct\nregulatory actions.\n\nMutation of genes encoding HD-GYP domain proteins\ninfluences virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nThe virulence of different strains of P. aeruginosa to larvae\nof G. mellonella were assessed as described in Experi-\n\nmental procedures, using 10 larvae at each inoculum\nlevel. The minimum inoculum of the wild-type required to\nkill all 10 larvae was 12 \ufffd 3 cfu (n = 9). For strains with\nmutation of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781, a higher level\nof bacteria was required to kill all 10 larvae, indicating a\nreduction in virulence. The minimum inoculum level (cfu)\nwas 1000 for the PA2572 mutant, 1100 for the PA4108\nmutant and 745 for the PA4781 mutant. Complemented\nPA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 strains had wild-type levels\nof virulence, with minimum inoculum level between 10\nand 15 cfu. All values are the means of quadruplicate\nmeasurements. The whole experiment was repeated\ntwice with essentially the same result. These findings\nindicated that all three HD-GYP domain proteins contrib-\nute to virulence in the Galleria model.\n\nA cryptic regulatory activity of the YN-GYP domain\nprotein PA2572\n\nIn some cases functions of domains within modular pro-\nteins may be cryptic and may only be revealed by analysis\nof the phenotypes of multiple transposon insertions in\neach gene or by the generation of specific deletion\nmutants (Kulesekara et al., 2006; Tarutina et al., 2006). A\npreliminary indication of such a cryptic activity of the\nYN-GYP domain of PA2572 was provided by the analysis\nof the motility phenotypes of four mutants with transposon\ninsertions in different sites in PA2572 (Jacobs et al., 2003;\nFig. 7A, which is a gene of 1344 nt. Although transposon\ninsertions at positions 113, 615 and 928 did not influence\nswarming or twitching, the insertion at position 1107 (in\nstrain 16841) led to a reduction in both types of motility\n(Fig. 7B and C; Fig. S5). All transposon mutants showed\nwild-type swimming motility, however (Fig. S5). The inser-\n\nFig. 2.

Elevated levels of extractable\nnucleotide were seen after mutation of PA4108 and PA4781, but\nnot PA2572. Introduction of the cloned PA4108 and PA4781 genes\ninto the appropriate mutants reduced cyclic di-GMP levels to\nwild-type.\n\nHD-GYP domain proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1129\n\n\u00a9 2008 The Authors\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2008 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 11, 1126\u20131136\n\n\n\ntion affecting swarming and twitching is within the region\nof PA2572 encoding the uncharacterized C-terminal\nextension. Introduction of the wild-type PA2572 gene\ncloned in pBBRMCS5-GmR into strain 16841 did not\nrestore wild-type motility (data not shown). These findings\nsuggested that truncation of PA2572 had revealed a\ndominant negative regulatory activity of the protein on\nP. aeruginosa twitching and swarming motility. Although\nthe insertion in strain 16841 led to a reduction in motility,\nthere was no effect on the production of pyocyanin,\npyoverdin or rhamnolipid (data not shown).\n\nThe YN-GYP domain has a dominant negative\neffect on swarming motility\n\nThe hypothesis that the truncated PA2572 has a dominant\nnegative effect on motility was further tested by experi-\nments in which the effects of expression of a truncated\nprotein with only REC and YN-GYP domains (encoded\nby nucleotides 1\u20131110) were examined. Constructs\n\nexpressing a protein with both REC and YN-GYP domains\ncloned in pBBRMCS5-GmR or the REC and YN-GYP\ndomains with a His6 tag cloned into pLAFR3 (see Experi-\nmental procedures) were introduced into the wild-type\nstrains mPAO1 and PAO1. This resulted in a negative\neffect on swarming and twitching in both strains (Fig. 8).\nThese effects were also seen when the construct cloned\nin pBBRMCS5-Gm was introduced into strain 8166\n(Fig. S6), which has a transposon insertion at position 113\nof PA2572 (Fig. 7A). In contrast, expression of either\nthe REC domain alone, the YN-GYP domain with the\nC-terminal extension (both with His6 tags) or of the\nYN-GYP domain alone had no effect on swarming motility\n(Fig. S7A and data not shown). Western analysis with\nantisera against the His6 tag showed that the different\nproteins were however expressed (Fig. S7B). Taken\ntogether, these results support the view that PA2572 has\na cryptic dominant negative effect on motility and indicate\nthat this action requires both the REC and YN-GYP\ndomains.\n\nFig. 4.

Mutation of either PA4108 or\nPA4781 leads to a reduction in motility associated with\nelevated cellular levels of cyclic di-GMP. Observations\nfrom a range of bacteria have similarly linked lower levels\nof the nucleotide with motile behaviour and higher cellular\nlevels with sessile behaviour and biofilm formation (Simm\net al., 2004). This apparently common action of PA4108\nand PA4781 in regulation of motility contrasts with distinct\neffects of mutation of PA4108 and PA4781 on biofilm\narchitecture and the synthesis of virulence determinants;\nmutation of PA4108 has different effects to mutation of\nPA4781 on the synthesis of pyoverdin and pyocyanin and\nonly mutation of PA4108 influences the levels of the type\nIII-secreted effector ExoS. The mechanistic basis for\nthese apparently diverse actions of HD-GYP domain pro-\nteins remains obscure.\n\nAn enzymatically inactive HD-GYP domain has a\nregulatory role\n\nA number of lines of evidence indicate that the YN-GYP\ndomain of PA2572 has no activity as a cyclic di-GMP\nphosphodiesterase. Expression of PA2572, the YN-GYP\ndomain attached to the uncharacterized C-terminal\ndomain or the isolated YN-GYP domain did not restore\nextracellular enzyme activity to the rpfG mutant of\n\nFig. 5.

Furthermore, the H231Y, D232N alteration in the\npresumed catalytic diad of the HD-GYP domain of RpfG\nabolished the regulatory effect on extracellular enzyme\nsynthesis in X. campestris. Nevertheless, mutation of\n\nPA2572 influenced biofilm architecture and caused over-\nproduction of rhamnolipid. Boles and colleagues (2005)\nhave demonstrated that rhamnolipids mediate formation\nof hollows or cavities within the centre of P. aeruginosa\nbiofilms and have proposed that this is associated with the\nprocess of bacterial detachment. It is therefore plausible\nthat the hollowing of the stalk of the mushroom produced\nby the PA2572 mutant is a consequence of the over-\nproduction of rhamnolipid by this strain.\n\nFurther to this, a cryptic regulatory role for the YN-GYP\ndomain on swarming was revealed through the use of\nmultiple transposon mutants within PA2572 and by\nexpression of the different domain combinations in the\nwild-type P. aeruginosa. Although the complete loss of\nPA2572 has no apparent effect on swarming, the loss of\nthe C-terminal domain results in a protein with a dominant\n\nFig. 7.

A similar reduction in swarming was seen in P. aeruginosa\nPAO1 carrying a construct expressing the C-terminally truncated\nPA2572 protein with a His6 tag, cloned in pLAFR3.\n\n1132 R. P. Ryan et al.\n\n\u00a9 2008 The Authors\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2008 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 11, 1126\u20131136\n\nhttp://www.gs.washington.edu/labs/manoil\n\n\nnegative effect. This construct also had no enzymatic\nactivity against cyclic di-GMP as assessed by heterolo-\ngous expression in X. campestris. As pointed out by\nKulesekara and colleagues (2006), analysis of the phe-\nnotypic effects of expressing such truncated proteins may\nor may not represent regulatory functions that occur\nduring the biological function of the full-length protein. The\nmechanism(s) by which the YN-GYP domain exerts these\neffects are unknown, but it is plausible that this involves\nprotein\u2013protein interactions. Yeast two-hybrid analysis\nhas revealed physical interactions between the HD-GYP\ndomain of RpfG from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri\nand a range of proteins including several with a GGDEF\ndomain as well as other regulators (Andrade et al., 2006).\nAlthough the biological relevance of such interactions has\nyet to be tested, these observations suggest a scenario\nwhereby the YN-GYP domain could modulate the activity\nof a subset of GGDEF domain proteins or other regulators\n(Andrade et al., 2006) with a consequent negative effect\non swarming. It is also possible that the YN-GYP domain\ninterferes with the action of the HD-GYP domain proteins\nPA4108 and PA4718, which have opposite effects on\nswarming to (truncated) PA2572.\n\nConservation of the C-terminal domain of PA2572 in\nother HD-GYP domain proteins\n\nOur results are consistent with a model in which the\nC-terminal domain of PA2572 acts to inhibit the function of\nthe YN-GYP domain in regulation of swarming, although\nthey give no clues as to the mechanism of inhibition or\nhow this is relieved to allow the proposed action of the\ndomain. Examination of the databases using BLASTP\nindicated that proteins with the same domain structure as\nPA2572, including the C-terminal domain, occur in a wide\nrange of bacteria including other Pseudomonas spp.,\nBurkholderia spp. and Vibrio cholerae. Many of these\nproteins have variations in the HD motif that include HG,\nHN, HE and HQ in addition to YN, which appears to be\nrestricted to the pseudomonads. It remains to be deter-\nmined if these proteins with alteration of the HD diad have\nenzymatic activity against cyclic di-GMP.\n\nThe finding that an enzymatically inactive HD-GYP\ndomain can have a regulatory activity has parallels in\nstudies of GGDEF and EAL domains, where variations in\nthe amino acids within the GGDEF and EAL motifs occur\nnaturally in some proteins. Domains with sequences that\nare divergent from the consensus may have lost enzy-\nmatic activity, but may still play a regulatory role. In the\nGGDEF-EAL domain proteins CC3396 from Caulobacter\ncrescentus and FimX from P. aeruginosa, binding of GTP\nto an enzymatically inactive GGDEF domain acts to regu-\nlate the activity of the EAL domain in cyclic di-GMP\nhydrolysis (Christen et al., 2005; Kazmierczak et al.,\n\n2006). Similar considerations may apply to inactive EAL\ndomains (Schmidt et al., 2005), which perhaps can bind\ncyclic di-GMP. As well as intramolecular effects, enzymati-\ncally inactive EAL or GGDEF domains could conceivably\nregulate cellular processes through intermolecular inter-\nactions with other proteins or other molecules, in a fashion\ninfluenced by the binding of cyclic di-GMP or GTP.\n\nHD-GYP domain proteins regulate virulence of\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nMutation of PA2572, PA4108 and PA4781 led to a reduc-\ntion in bacterial virulence in the larvae of G. mellonella. In\nP. aeruginosa strain PA14, the type III-secreted effectors\nExoT and ExoU have a significant role in G. mellonella\nkilling, although translocation of ExoT or ExoU alone is\nsufficient to give near wild-type levels of killing. (P. aerugi-\nnosa PA14 has no exoS gene). As far as we are aware,\nthe role of ExoS in virulence of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to\nG. mellonella has not yet been established. Although\nmutation of PA4108 leads to a reduction in the levels of\nExoS we cannot infer a causal relationship to the reduc-\ntion of killing; the processes that contribute to virulence\nthat are regulated by the HD-GYP domain proteins in\nbacteria within the host are unknown.\n\nThese observations add to a body of work that indicates\na role for proteins with GGDEF and/or EAL domain, and\nby inference cyclic di-GMP, in the regulation of virulence\nand virulence factor synthesis in P. aeruginosa as well as\nin a number of human, animal and plant pathogens includ-\ning Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp. and Xanthomonas\ncampestris (Hisert et al., 2005; Tischler and Camilli, 2005;\nKulesekara et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2007). As with\nP. aeruginosa, the genomes of many of these bacteria\nencode between 1 and 4 HD-GYP domain proteins,\nalthough they are absent in Salmonella spp. and E. coli\nand more highly represented in Vibrio spp., where V. chol-\nerae has 9 and V. vulnificus has 15. HD-GYP domain\nproteins are also found in a number of other bacterial\npathogens of animals including Clostridium perfringens,\nBordetella bronchiseptica and Treponema denticola.\nWhether these proteins play a significant role in the viru-\nlence of these diverse pathogenic bacteria remains to be\ndetermined.\n\nExperimental procedures\n\nBacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditions\n\nThe bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are\nlisted in Table S1. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were\nroutinely cultured in Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) broth. Xanthomonas\ncampestris strains were routinely grown in NYGB medium,\nwhich comprises Bacteriological Peptone (Oxoid, Basing-\nstoke, UK), 5 g l-1; yeast extract (Difco), 3 g l-1 and glycerol,\n\nHD-GYP domain proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1133\n\n\u00a9 2008 The Authors\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2008 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 11, 1126\u20131136\n\n\n\n20 g l-1. Antibiotics rifampicin (Rif), tetracycline (Tc), chloram-\nphenicol (Cm) and gentamycin (Gm) were added where\nappropriate.\n\nConstruction and complementation of PA2572, PA4108\nand PA4781 mutants\n\nMutants were created by the disruption of gene with the use\nof the suicide plasmid pEX18Gm (see Table S1). Briefly, an\ninternal fragment of each of the genes was amplified using\nthe primers detailed in Table S2 and was cloned into the\nTOPO (Invitrogen) vector. This fragment was excised with\nEcoRI and ligated into the suicide plasmid pEX18Gm cut with\nthe same enzyme. This construct was introduced into PAO1\nby electroporation. Mutants were selected by plating on LB\nagar medium containing gentamicin (20 mg ml-1). Candidate\nstrains were analysed by colony PCR using the primers\ndetailed in Table S2 to confirm disruption of the PA2572,\nPA4108 and PA4781 gene by integration of the suicide\nvector. Complementing clones were constructed in\npBBRMCS3 using DNA fragments amplified using primers\ndetailed in Table S2.\n\nExpression of the HD-GYP domains of P. aeruginosa\nproteins in Xanthomonas campestris\n\nDNA fragments encoding the HD-GYP domain from PA2572,\nPA4108 and PA4781 with a C-terminal His6-tag were ampli-\nfied by PCR by using chromosomal DNA of P. aeruginosa\nstrain PAO1, as template with primers carrying restriction\nsites for BamHI and HindIII (see Table S2). These amplified\nfragments were cloned into the TOPO (Invitrogen) vector.\nThe appropriate DNA fragments were excised from these\nconstructs using BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pLAFR3\nthat had been cut with the same enzymes so that expression\nis under control of the lac promoter of the vector. Constructs\nwere introduced into X. campestris wild-type or rpfG mutant\nby triparental mating using the helper plasmid pRK2073.\nProcedures used for Western analysis to examine protein\nexpression levels using an anti-His6 antibody are described\nin Supporting Information.\n\nPhenotypic analyses\n\nMethods used for assay of extracellular enzyme activities in\nX. campestris, and for assays in of motility, pyoverdine, pyo-\ncyanin, rhamnolipid and ExoS production in P. aeruginosa\nare given in Supporting Information. Virulence of P. aerugi-\nnosa to larvae of G. mellonella was tested as described pre-\nviously (Miyata et al., 2003). Bacterial suspensions from a\ndilution series were inoculated into larvae, with 10 larvae\nused for each inoculum level. The minimum inoculum\nrequired to kill all 10 larvae was determined for each strain.\nAdditional details are given in the Supporting Information.\n\nCultivation and imaging of biofilms\n\nBiofilms were grown in flow chambers with individual channel\ndimensions of 1 \u00a5 4 \u00a5 40 mm. The flow system was\n\nassembled and prepared as described by Sternberg and\nTolker-Nielsen (2005). The flow chambers were inoculated by\ninjecting 350 ml of overnight culture diluted to an OD600 of 0.01\ninto each flow channel with a syringe. After inoculation, flow\nchannels were left without flow for 1 h, after which medium\nflow at a linear rate of 0.2 mm s-1 was started using a Watson\nMarlow 205S peristaltic pump.\n\nAll microscopic observations and image acquisitions were\nperformed on an LSM510 confocal laser scanning micro-\nscope (CLSM) (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with\ndetectors and filter sets for monitoring Syto9 fluorescence.\nSimulated three-dimensional images, shadow projections\nand sections were generated using the Imaris software\npackage (Bitplane AG, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland).\n\nDetection and quantification of cyclic di-GMP\n\nThe method for detection and quantification of cyclic di-GMP\nfrom X. campestris or P. aeruginosa strains was adapted\nfrom Simm and colleagues (2004; 2005).

(C) Western\nblot analysis with an anti-His6 antiserum shows that all\nvariant proteins are expressed in X. campestris. Lanes: 1,\nrpfG (pLAFR3); 2, rpfG (HD-GYPHis6); 3, rpfG (YD-\nGYPHis6); 4, rpfG (YN-GYPHis6).\nFig. S3. Mutation of PA2752 but not PA4108 or PA4781 has\nan effect on the production of rhamnolipid in culture super-\nnatants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The level of rhamno-\nlipid in culture supernatants of strains grown in PPGAS\nmedium was measured as described by Boles and col-\nleagues (2005). Complementation of the PA2572 mutant\nreduces rhamnolipid production back to wild-type levels.\nFig. S4. Biofilm architectures of complemented PA2572,\nPA4108 and PA4781 mutants are similar to the wild-type\nP. aeruginosa. Images are of 4-day-old biofilms in flow cells in\nFAB medium. (A) P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type; (B) comple-\nmented PA2572 mutant; (C) complemented PA4108 mutant;\nand (D) complemented PA4781 mutant. For these experi-\nments, P. aeruginosa was visualized with Syto9, as described\nin Experimental procedures. Scale bars = 20 mm. (E)\nBiomass of biofilms produced by different strains of P. aerugi-\nnosa as measured using COMSTAT. Values are means \ufffd SD\nof 13 measurements.\nFig. S5. Motility phenotypes of P. aeruginosa mPAO1 and\nderived mutants with transposon insertion at different loca-\ntions within PA2572, which has 1344 nt. (A and B) Swimming\nbehaviour of the mutants is indistinguishable from the wild-\ntype mPAO1 on (A) Eiken medium with 0.3% agar or (B) CAA\nmedium with 0.3% agar. (C) Swarming motility on CAA\nmedium solidified with 0.6% agar at pH 7.4 is affected only in\nstrain 16841, which has the transposon insertion located at\n\nnt 1107. (D) Twitching motility on CAA medium solidified with\n0.5% agar at pH 7.4 is also only affected in strain 16841.\nFig. S6. The negative influence of expression of PA2572\nwith a Cterminal truncation on swarming motility is also seen\nin a PA2572 mutant background. Swarming motility (A and B)\nand swimming motility (C and D) were assessed in the\nP. aeruginosa wild-type mPA01 and mutant strain 8166,\nthese strains carrying the cloning vector pBBRMCS5\n(labelled as vector) and these strains carrying a construct\nexpressing the C-terminally truncated PA2572 protein\n(labelled as Insert). Introduction of pTRUN into mPA01 and\nstrain 8166 influences swarming motility over that seen with\nthe vector control (A and B) but has no effect on swimming\ncompared with a vector control (C and D). Note that the\npBBRMCS5 vector alone has an influence on both forms of\nmotility. Shown are representatives of swimming and swarm-\ning plates after 18 h of incubation.\nFig. S7. Expression of the isolated REC domain of PA2572\nin mPAO1 does not influence swarming motility. (A) The REC\ndomain of PA2572 expressed using pBBRMCS-5 does not\ngive the swarming-negative phenotype in a P. aeruginosa\nmPAO1 or in strain 8166 (shown). Introduction of the REC\ndomain with a His6 tag expressed using pLAFR3 gave the\nsame result. This contrasts with the effects seen with expres-\nsion of REC-YN-GYP (the truncated PA2572) using pTRUN,\nwhich gives substantially reduced swarming (see Fig. S5).\n(B) Western blot analysis with an anti-His6 antiserum shows\nthat both the REC domain and REC-YN-GYP domain\nproteins are expressed in mPAO1. Lanes: 1, mPAO1\n(pBBRMCS); 2, mPAO1 (pLAFR3); 3, mPAO1 (pRECHis6);\n4, mPAO1 (pTRUNHis6).\nTable S1. Strains and plasmids.\nTable S2.
