Nasal immunization with 25k-hagA-MBP induced high\nlevels of 25k-hagA-specific serum IgG, serum IgA, and salivary IgA antibodies in a Toll-like receptor 4\n(TLR4)-dependent manner. These antibody responses were maintained for at least 1 year after immunization.\nAnalysis of cytokine responses showed that nasal administration of 25k-hagA-MBP induced antigen-specific\nCD4\ufffd T cells producing interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-5, but not gamma interferon (IFN-\ufffd), in the spleen and\ncervical lymph nodes (CLNs). Furthermore, increased numbers of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd, but not CD11c\ufffd CD11b\ufffd\n\nor CD11c\ufffd B220\ufffd, dendritic cells with upregulated expression of CD80, CD86, CD40, and major histocom-\npatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules were noted in the spleen, CLNs, and nasopharynx-associated\nlymphoreticular tissues (NALT). Interestingly, when 25k-hagA-MBP or cholera toxin (CT) was given intra-\nnasally to enable examination of their presence in neuronal tissues, the amounts of 25k-hagA-MBP were\nsignificantly lower than those of CT. Importantly, mice given 25k-hagA-MBP nasally showed a significant\nreduction in alveolar bone loss caused by oral infection with P. gingivalis, even 1 year after the immunization.\nThese results suggest that 25k-hagA-MBP administered nasally would be an effective and safe mucosal vaccine\nagainst P. gingivalis infection and may be an important tool for the prevention of chronic periodontitis in\nhumans.\n\nChronic periodontitis is a common oral inflammatory dis-\nease that causes the breakdown of periodontal tissues, includ-\ning resorption of alveolar bone and tooth loss (7). Further-\nmore, recent studies have demonstrated that periodontitis is\nmuch more than a localized oral infection: it may cause ad-\nverse changes in systemic physiology, such as cardiovascular\ndisease, diabetes, and osteoporosis (2, 9, 15, 23, 28, 38, 39, 45).\nHence, prevention of periodontitis is important for both oral\nand systemic health.\n\nSubgingival Gram-negative bacteria are associated with the\nonset and progression of chronic periodontitis; populations of\na few opportunistic pathogens, including Porphyromonas gin-\ngivalis, are increased during development from a healthy site to\na diseased site (7, 22). Molecules such as fimbriae, aggregation\nfactors, lipopolysaccharides, and numerous proteolytic en-\nzymes responsible for colonization have been identified as vir-\nulence factors (22, 37). Hemagglutinin, which is known to be\nlocated on the cell surface and in vesicles of P. gingivalis, has\nbeen proposed to mediate bacterial attachment to, and pene-\n\ntration of, host cells and may also agglutinate and lyse eryth-\nrocytes in order to take up heme, an absolute requirement for\nthe growth of the bacterium (6, 8, 41). Multiple hemagglutinin\ngenes have been cloned from P. gingivalis by functional screen-\ning (35, 42, 44, 49). Among these, hemagglutinin A (HagA) has\nbeen thought to contain the functional domain of hemagglu-\ntinin and to be a potentially useful immunogen that elicits a\nprotective immune response against subsequent colonization\nby P. gingivalis (30). The hagA gene is 7,887 bp long and\nencodes a protein of 2,628 amino acids, with a molecular mass\nof 283.3 kDa (17). This gene has four large, contiguous direct\nrepeats, and the repeat unit is believed to contain the hemag-\nglutinin domain (17). Previous studies have demonstrated the\nmolecular cloning of a 200-kDa antigenic protein (200-k AP)\nfrom P. gingivalis and have shown that 200-k AP is identical to\nHagA (10, 19). Furthermore, the DNA sequence of a subclone\nencoding the 25-kDa antigenic region of 200-k AP (25k-hagA)\nis identical to that of the first repeat of hagA (10). These\nstudies suggest that 25k-hagA may be a useful vaccine antigen\n(Ag) for the prevention of periodontitis caused by P. gingivalis\ninfection.\n\nMaltose-binding protein (MBP) is a high-affinity maltose/\nmaltodextrin-binding protein responsible for the capture and\ntransport of maltodextrins from the periplasmic space in\nGram-negative bacteria (4). MBP is used as a fusion partner\nfor recombinant protein expression to improve the yield and to\n\n* Corresponding author.

Further-\nmore, the stability and solubility of a passenger protein can be\nimproved by fusing it to MBP (12). Recently, MBP was used as\na chaperone component in various vaccines and was shown to\nenhance antigen-specific immune responses (32, 46, 48, 51, 52).\nIn this regard, a previous in vitro study has shown that MBP\ninduces dendritic cell (DC) activation and increases I\ufffd\ufffd phos-\nphorylation in treated cells. Furthermore, phosphorylation of\nI\ufffd\ufffd is largely abrogated by the addition of antibodies against\ntoll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (11). These findings suggest that\nMBP stimulates DCs via TLR4, and this may account for the\nadjuvanticity of MBP.\n\nIn the present study, we assessed the potential of a fusion\nprotein consisting of the 25-kDa antigenic region of P. gingi-\nvalis HagA and MBP (25k-hagA-MBP) as a nasal vaccine for\nthe prevention of oral infection with P. gingivalis. The results\nsuggest that nasal 25k-hagA-MBP is a practical, effective, and\nsafe vaccine candidate for the induction of protective immunity\nagainst alveolar bone loss caused by P. gingivalis infection.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nMice. BALB/c mice and Toll-like receptor 4 gene-disrupted (TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd)\nBALB/c mice were purchased from Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The\nmice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions at the experimental facil-\nity of the Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo. All mice were\nrandomly assigned to control or experimental groups of 4 to 6 mice each and\nwere provided ad libitum access to sterile food and water. They were used at the\nage of 8 to 12 weeks in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of\nLaboratory Animals (Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo).\n\nAntigen. Plasmid pMD157, encoding the 25k-hagA-MBP fusion protein, was\nconstructed as described previously (25). Briefly, plasmid pMD101, encoding\n200-k AP (19), was partially digested with HaeIII, methylated, and ligated with\nEcoRI polylinkers. Plasmid vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,\nMA), which carries the MBP gene, was digested with EcoRI. Both digested\nDNAs were ligated with T4 DNA ligase and were then transformed into Esch-\nerichia coli K-12 cells. The constructed clones were screened by Western blot\nanalysis with antibodies against recombinant 200-k AP and MBP. 25k-hagA-\nMBP and MBP-free 25k-hagA were purified to homogeneity utilizing amylase\nresin affinity chromatography (New England Biolabs). The purity of the pro-\nteins was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electro-\nphoresis (SDS-PAGE), and no contaminating protein bands were noted.\nFurthermore, the possible presence of residual endotoxin in the preparation\nwas assessed with a Pyrochrome Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) kit (As-\nsociates of Cape Cod Inc., Woods Hole, MA). 25k-hagA-MBP and 25k-hagA\ncontained as little as 0.3 pg of endotoxin, which did not induce cell activation\nin vitro (data not shown). Cholera toxin (CT) was obtained from List Bio-\nlogical Laboratories (Campbell, CA).\n\nImmunization and sample collection. Mice were immunized nasally on days 0,\n7, and 14 with a 10-\ufffdl aliquot (5 \ufffdl per nostril) of phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS) containing 20 \ufffdg of either 25k-hagA, 25k-hagA-MBP, or MBP. In some\nexperiments, mice were given 20 \ufffdg of 25k-hagA plus 1 \ufffdg of CT (as a mucosal\nadjuvant) nasally. Serum and saliva samples were collected from each group, as\ndescribed elsewhere (56), in order to examine 25k-hagA-specific antibody re-\nsponses.\n\nDetection of antigen-specific antibody responses. Antibody titers in serum and\nsaliva were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).\nBriefly, plates were coated with 25k-hagA (5 \ufffdg/ml) or a sonicated extract of P.\ngingivalis (5 \ufffd 108 cells/ml) and were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine\nserum albumin. After blocking, serial dilutions of serum or saliva samples were\nadded in duplicate. The starting dilution of serum was 1:25, while that of saliva\nwas 1:21. The plates were incubated for 4 h at room temperature, washed, and\nthen incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse heavy\nchain \ufffd-, \ufffd1-, \ufffd2a-, \ufffd2b-, \ufffd3-, or \ufffd-specific antibodies (Southern Biotechnology\nAssociates, Birmingham, AL) at 4\u00b0C for 20 h. Finally, 2,2\t-azino-bis(3-ethyl-\nbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) with H2O2 (Moss, Inc., Pasadena, MD) was\nadded for color development. Endpoint titers were expressed as the reciprocal\nlog2 of the last dilution giving an optical density at 415 nm of 0.1 greater than that\nof nonimmunized control samples after 15 min of incubation.\n\nAssessment of antibody-forming cells. Single-cell suspensions were obtained\nfrom the salivary gland 7 days after the last immunization. Briefly, salivary glands\nwere carefully excised, teased apart, and dissociated using 0.3 mg/ml collagenase\n(Nitta Gelatin Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in RPMI 1640 (Wako Pure Chemical\nIndustries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Mononuclear cells were obtained at the interface\nof the 50% and 75% layers of a discontinuous Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare\nUK, Ltd., Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) (36). To assess numbers of antigen-\nspecific antibody-forming cells, an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay\nwas performed as described previously (57). Briefly, 96-well nitrocellulose plates\n(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were coated with 25k-hagA (5 \ufffdg/ml),\nincubated for 20 h at 4\u00b0C, and then washed extensively before being blocked with\nRPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 30 min, the blocking solution\nwas discarded, and cell suspensions at various dilutions were added to wells and\nincubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 in moist air. The cells were washed and\nthen incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse heavy\nchain \ufffd-specific antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates) at 4\u00b0C for 20 h.\nFollowing incubation, the plates were washed with PBS and were developed by\nthe addition to each well of 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole dissolved in 0.1 M sodium\nacetate buffer containing H2O2 (Moss). Plates were incubated at room temper-\nature for 25 min and were washed with water, and antibody-forming cells were\nthen counted with the aid of a stereomicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n25k-hagA-specific CD4\ufffd T cell responses. CD4\ufffd T cells from spleens and\ncervical lymph nodes (CLNs) were isolated 7 days after the last immunization by\nusing the IMag system (BD Biosciences) as described elsewhere (18). Briefly,\nmononuclear cells were mixed with anti-CD4 antibodies and were incubated at\n4\u00b0C for 30 min, after which CD4\ufffd T cells were separated using a magnet. The\npurity of CD4\ufffd T cells was determined by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD\nBiosciences) and was routinely \n90%. The CD4\ufffd T cells (2.0 \ufffd 106/ml) were\nthen cultured with 5 \ufffdg/ml of 25k-hagA in the presence of T cell-depleted,\nmitomycin-treated splenic feeder cells (2.5 \ufffd 106 cells) in RPMI 1640 medium\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 \ufffdM 2-mercaptoethanol, 15 mM\nHEPES, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 \ufffdg/ml of streptomycin, and 10 U/ml of\nrecombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2). Cultures were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C\nunder 5% CO2 in air. To measure 25k-hagA-specific cell proliferation, 1.0 \ufffdCi of\n[3H]thymidine was added to the culture 18 h before harvesting, and incorporated\nradioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Culture supernatants were\nharvested after 5 days of incubation. The levels of IL-4, IL-5, and gamma\ninterferon (IFN-\ufffd) in the culture supernatants were determined using commer-\ncially available assay kits (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL) in accor-\ndance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nDC analysis. Dendritic cell (DC)-enriched cell populations were isolated from\nspleens, CLNs, and nasopharynx-associated lymphoreticular tissues (NALT) 7\ndays after the last immunization, as described previously (26). Briefly, lymphoid\ntissues were digested with collagenase D (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,\nGermany) and DNase I (Roche) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal\nbovine serum albumin, with continuous stirring at 37\u00b0C for 45 to 90 min. EDTA\nwas added (final concentration, 10 mM), and the cell suspension was incubated\nfor an additional 5 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were spun through a 15.5% Accudenz\n(Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) solution to enrich for\nDCs. DC-enriched cell populations were analyzed for the expression of various\ncell surface molecules by using fluorescence-labeled antibodies. The purity of\nCD11c\ufffd cells was routinely \n50%. Aliquots of mononuclear cells (0.2 \ufffd 106 to\n1.0 \ufffd 106 cells) isolated from various tissues were stained with fluorescein\nisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD80, CD86, CD40, or I-Ad\n\nmonoclonal antibodies; phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-mouse CD11c monoclo-\nnal antibodies; and Alexa-labeled anti-mouse B220, CD11b, and CD8\ufffd mono-\nclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences). Samples were then subjected to fluores-\ncence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis (BD Biosciences).\n\nOral infection. Mice were orally infected with P. gingivalis as described previ-\nously (1, 14, 33), with minor modifications. Briefly, mice were given ad libitum\naccess to deionized water containing sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Sulfatrim;\nGoldline Laboratories, Fort Lauderdale, FL) at 10 ml per pint for 10 days. This\nwas followed by a 3-day antibiotic-free period. Mice were then administered 109\n\nCFU of P. gingivalis suspended in 100 \ufffdl of PBS with 2% carboxymethylcellulose\nvia oral topical application. Mice were inoculated 5 times a week (from Monday\nto Friday) for 3 weeks, for a total of 15 inoculations. Control groups included\nsham-infected mice, which received antibiotic pretreatment and carboxymethyl-\ncellulose without P. gingivalis.\n\nMeasurement of alveolar bone loss. Forty-seven days after the first gavage,\nmice were euthanized using CO2 for assessment of alveolar bone loss. Horizontal\nbone loss around the maxillary molars was assessed using a morphometric\nmethod as described previously (29). Briefly, skulls were defleshed after 10 min\nof treatment in boiling water under 15-lb/in2 pressure, immersed overnight in 3%\n\n896 DU ET AL. INFECT.

The distance from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar bone\ncrest (ABC) was measured at a total of 14 buccal sites per mouse. Measurements\nwere made under a dissecting microscope (magnification, \ufffd50) fitted with a\nvideo image marker measurement system (VHX-100; Keyence, Osaka, Japan)\nstandardized to give measurements in micrometers. Bone measurements were\nperformed a total of three times by two evaluators using a random and blinded\nprotocol.\n\nDistribution of 25k-hagA-MBP. The 25k-hagA-MBP protein and CT were\nlabeled with acridinium ester (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) in accor-\ndance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Mice were given acridinium ester-\nlabeled 25k-hagA-MBP (10 \ufffdg and 20 \ufffdg) or acridinium ester-labeled CT (1 \ufffdg\nand 5 \ufffdg) via the nasal route. All nasal applications were given in a final volume\nof 10 \ufffdl (5 \ufffdl per nostril) to na\u00efve mice. At 24 h after administration, mice were\nsacrificed, and the olfactory nerves and epithelium (ON/E), olfactory bulbs (OB),\nand brains were removed as described previously (54). Each tissue was homog-\nenized; the homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 \ufffd g for 10 min; and the\nsupernatants were tested for light activity by a luminometer (ARVO MX; Per-\nkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA).\n\nStatistics. Data are expressed as means \ufffd standard errors (SE) and were\ncompared using an unpaired Student t test.\n\nRESULTS\n\nNasal 25k-hagA-MBP elicits long-term antibody responses\nin a TLR4-dependent manner. In an initial study, mice were\n\nimmunized nasally with various amounts (10, 20, and 50 \ufffdg) of\n25k-hagA-MBP or 25k-hagA in order to determine optimal\nconcentrations for the induction of antibody responses. All of\nthe dosages of 25k-hagA failed to induce 25k-specific serum\nIgG or IgA antibody responses that were above the dilution\ncutoff (log2 of 5) used in our experiments. In contrast, 20 \ufffdg of\n25k-hagA-MBP induced high 25k-hagA-specific serum anti-\nbody titers that were comparable to those induced by 50 \ufffdg of\nthe fusion protein (data not shown). Therefore, 20 \ufffdg of 25k-\nhagA-MBP was used throughout this study. The time course of\nanti-25k-hagA-specific serum antibody responses is shown in\nFig. 1A. Mice immunized nasally with 25k-hagA-MBP showed\nsignificant levels of serum IgG and IgA antibodies. Further-\nmore, the serum IgG and IgA antibody responses induced by\n25k-hagA-MBP persisted for at least 1 year. As expected, ad-\nministration of MBP alone or PBS did not induce 25k-hagA-\nspecific antibody responses (data not shown). To provide a\ndirect comparison of antibody responses to 25k-hagA-MBP,\nmice were given 25k-hagA plus CT as the adjuvant nasally.\nInterestingly, serum anti-25k-hagA IgG and IgA antibody ti-\nters induced by 25k-hagA-MBP were comparable to those in-\nduced by 25k-hagA plus CT (Fig. 1B).

In addition, IgA anti-25k-\nhagA antibodies in saliva were maintained for 1 year, although\nthe responses decreased gradually from day 28 (Fig. 2B). As\nexpected, nasal delivery of 25k-hagA, MBP alone, or PBS\nfailed to elicit 25k-hagA-specific antibody titers in the starting\ndilution (log2 of 1) used in these experiments. Analysis of\nantibody-forming cells confirmed the results described above\nby revealing high numbers of IgA antibody-forming cells in\nsalivary glands following nasal administration of 25k-hagA-\nMBP and by showing low numbers of antibody-forming cells\nin the salivary glands of mice given 25k-hagA alone [(170 \ufffd\n\n16) \ufffd 106 cells for 25k-hagA-MBP versus (34 \ufffd 21) \ufffd 106\n\ncells for 25k-hagA].\nTo test the possibility that MBP adjuvanticity is mediated via\n\nsignaling through TLR4, we examined antibody responses in\nTLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice. To this end, TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice were immunized\nnasally with 25k-hagA-MBP or 25k-hagA by using an immuni-\nzation regimen identical to that described above. As expected,\nonly low 25k-hagA-specific serum IgG antibody responses, and\nno detectable serum IgA antibody responses, were induced in\nTLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice on day 21, while nasal administration to\nTLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice resulted in the induction of high IgG and IgA\nantibody responses. Furthermore, nasal immunization of\nTLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice with 25k-hagA-MBP failed to elicit anti-25k-\nhagA IgA antibodies in the saliva (Fig. 3). Although we con-\ntinued to examine antibody levels until day 49, the responses in\nthe TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mouse group did not change (data not shown).\nAs expected, nasal immunization of TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice with 25k-\nhagA failed to induce 25k-hagA-specific serum IgG, serum\n\nFIG. 2. 25k-hagA-specific IgA antibody response in saliva.

Taken together, these\nresults indicate that 25k-hagA-MBP is a potential nasal vaccine\nfor the induction of Ag-specific mucosal and systemic antibody\nresponses and that signaling through TLR4 is involved in, and\nis necessary for, the mucosal adjuvanticity of MBP.\n\n25k-hagA-specific CD4\ufffd T cell responses. Since nasal im-\nmunization with 25k-hagA-MBP elicited 25k-hagA-specific an-\ntibody responses in both mucosal and systemic compartments,\nit was important to establish the nature of the CD4\ufffd T cell\nhelp supporting the 25k-hagA-specific antibody responses.\nWhen CD4\ufffd T cells from the spleens or CLNs (which are\ndraining lymph nodes of the maxillofacial mucosal compart-\nments) of immunized mice were restimulated with 25k-hagA in\nvitro, significant levels of proliferative responses were induced\n(Fig. 4A).\n\nAnalysis of the cytokine responses revealed that 25k-hagA-\nspecific CD4\ufffd T cells from the spleen and CLNs produced\nhigh levels of IL-4 and IL-5 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, CD4\ufffd T cells\n\nfrom immunized mice had an impaired ability to produce\nIFN-\ufffd (data not shown). These results clearly show that nasal\nadministration of 25k-hagA-MBP induces Th2-type cytokine\nresponses to support antigen-specific mucosal IgA, as well as\nserum IgG and IgA, antibody responses.\n\nNasal administration of 25k-hagA-MBP expands CD11c\ufffd\n\nCD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in mucosal and systemic lymphoid tissues. We\nnext investigated the frequency of CD11c\ufffd DCs in various\nmucosal and systemic lymphoid tissues. Our results showed\nlarge increases in the percentages of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in\nthe spleens, CLNs, and NALT of mice given nasal 25k-hagA-\nMBP relative to those in mice given 25k-hagA. In contrast, the\nproportions of CD11c\ufffd CD11b\ufffd DCs and CD11c\ufffd B220\ufffd\n\nDCs were not altered (Fig. 5). Furthermore, these expanded\nDCs expressed greater numbers of costimulatory molecules\n(CD40, CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex\nclass II [MHC II]) than DCs from mice given 25k-hagA (Table\n1). The activation of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs by 25k-hagA-MBP\nwas due to the adjuvanticity of MBP, because nasal adminis-\ntration of MBP induced this DC subset (Fig. 5 and Table 1).\n\nSince some activated T cells can also express CD11c, the\nproportions of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs were reevaluated with\nMHC class II. The results showed that the percentages of\nMHC class IIhigh CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in CD11c\ufffd cells of the spleens,\nCLNs, and NALT of mice given nasal 25k-hagA-MBP or MBP\nalone were higher than those for mice given 25k-hagA (Table\n2). Taken together, these results indicate that nasal adminis-\ntration of 25k-hagA-MBP preferentially expands CD11c\ufffd\n\nCD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs and also induces their activation in both mucosal\ninductive and systemic lymphoid tissues.\n\nNasal 25k-hagA-MBP reduces alveolar bone loss caused by\noral infection with P. gingivalis. Since nasal 25k-hagA-MBP\nelicited long-term antigen-specific antibody responses in sera\nand saliva, we sought to determine whether these antibodies\nwere protective. Thus, mice given 25k-hagA-MBP were in-\nfected orally with P. gingivalis. Mice immunized with 25k-\nhagA-MBP or 25k-hagA plus CT showed a significant reduc-\ntion in alveolar bone loss caused by P. gingivalis infection 7 days\n\nFIG. 3. 25k-hagA-specific serum IgG and IgA and salivary IgA\nantibody responses in TLR4\ufffd/\ufffd mice.

The results indicated\nthat the levels of serum IgG, serum IgA, and salivary IgA\nantibodies to both 25k-hagA and P. gingivalis were identical\nbefore and after infection (Fig. 6C and D). These results indi-\ncate that specific antibodies induced by nasal 25k-hagA-MBP\nprovide protection against P. gingivalis infection.

Significantly lower levels of\n25k-hagA-MBP accumulation were observed in the ON/E, OB,\n\nand brain samples isolated from the group given 25k-hagA-\nMBP nasally than from the group given CT (Fig. 7). These\nresults indicate that nasal administration of 25k-hagA-MBP\ndoes not target neuronal tissues.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPrevious studies have shown that hagA has four large, con-\ntiguous direct repeats, and the repeat unit is thought to contain\nthe hemagglutinin domain (17, 43). Furthermore, the DNA\nsequence of 25k-hagA is identical to that of the first repeat of\nhagA (10). These findings have led to the consideration of\n25k-hagA as a candidate Ag for the development of human\nvaccines. Our present study explored the potential of 25k-\nhagA-MBP as a nasal vaccine by using it as a model system\nwith which to study the nature and kinetics of 25k-hagA-MBP-\ninduced Ag-specific antibody responses and their protective\nability against oral infection by P. gingivalis. In the initial study,\n25k-hagA was administered nasally for the investigation of\nAg-specific antibody responses. The results demonstrated that\n\nTABLE 2.

Indeed, numerous\nstudies have demonstrated that nasal administration of pro-\nteins is only weakly immunogenic and requires appropriate\nAg delivery systems for the induction of sufficient immune\nresponses in both mucosal and systemic compartments (21,\n31, 58).\n\nMBP has been widely used as a chaperone component in\nvaccines and has been shown to enhance Ag-specific humoral\nand cellular immune responses (32, 46, 48, 51, 52). Thus, in the\npresent study, we assessed the potential of a nasal vaccine,\n25k-hagA fused to MBP, to induce an immune response after\nhost challenge. We have demonstrated that nasal administra-\ntion of 25k-hagA-MBP induces high levels of 25k-hagA-spe-\ncific serum IgG, serum IgA, and salivary IgA antibody re-\nsponses that are comparable to those induced by 25k-hagA\nplus an established mucosal adjuvant, CT. Furthermore, these\nantibodies persist for at least 1 year. Induction of antibody\nresponses is associated with elevated numbers of activated\nCD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in both mucosal and systemic lymphoid\ntissues. Thus, increased proportions of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs\nwith upregulated expression of MHC II, CD40, CD80, and\nCD86 molecules in NALT, CLNs, and the spleen were noted in\nmice given 25k-hagA-MBP. Furthermore, 25k-hagA-MBP in-\nduced CD4\ufffd T cells producing predominantly Th2 cytokines\n(IL-4 and IL-5), as well as IgG1 and IgG2b responses. Impor-\ntantly, mice given 25k-hagA-MBP were significantly protected\nagainst alveolar bone loss caused by oral infection with P.\ngingivalis, even 1 year after immunization. Interestingly, how-\never, our separate study has shown that when 25k-hagA mixed\nwith MBP was given nasally to mice, no detectable antibody\ntiters were induced (Y. Du et al., unpublished observations).\nThus, unlike other adjuvants, MBP should be fused to the\ntarget antigen. These studies demonstrate that MBP is an\neffective adjuvant for nasal immunization and that when used\n\nas a fusion partner for 25k-hagA, it facilitates the development\nof a long-term protective antibody response.\n\nA previous study confirmed by Western immunoblotting that\noral immunization with recombinant avirulent Salmonella en-\nterica serovar Typhimurium expressing HagA induces HagA-\nspecific serum antibody responses (30). In addition, a hen egg\nyolk antibody (IgY) against a truncated HagA protein has been\ndeveloped (53). However, none of these studies have quanti-\ntatively evaluated the immunogenicity as well as the protective\nefficacy of HagA vaccines. Thus, our results are the first to\nshow that a nasal vaccine combining MBP and 25k-hagA in-\nduces a long-term protective antibody response against oral\ninfection with P. gingivalis.\n\nIt is well known that CD4\ufffd T cells and their derived Th\ncytokines are essential for the induction of Ag-specific anti-\nbody responses. We found that CD4\ufffd T cells from the spleens\nand CLNs of mice immunized nasally with 25k-hagA-MBP\nsecreted IL-4 and IL-5 in response to stimulation with 25k-\nhagA. On the other hand, no detectable IFN-\ufffd production was\nfound. IgG subclass responses confirmed the cytokine profile,\nshowing that 25k-hagA-MBP elicited anti-25k-hagA IgG1 and\nIgG2b antibodies. These results suggest that the adjuvant ac-\ntivity of nasally administered MBP is mediated by IL-4-pro-\nducing Th2-type CD4\ufffd T cells. However, a previous study has\nshown that intraperitoneal immunization with a Rickettsia tsut-\nsugamushi antigen fused with MBP induces IFN-\ufffd-producing\nTh1-type responses (48). The basis for the different T helper\ncytokine patterns induced by MBP is not known. One possible\nexplanation is the route of immunization. In this regard, it has\nbeen shown that DCs freshly isolated from Peyer\u2019s patches, but\nnot from the spleen, induce the differentiation of Th2 cells\n(24). Furthermore, single-cell reverse transcription-PCR (RT-\nPCR) analysis revealed high numbers of Th2 cytokine-specific\nmRNA molecules expressed by CD4\ufffd T cells in nasal passages,\nwhile CD4\ufffd T cells with a Th0 profile were present in NALT\n(20). Moreover, although CT is known to induce Th2 cells that\nsecrete high levels of IL-4 when it is given via mucosal routes\n(59), parenteral administration of CT elicited both Th1- and\nTh2-type cytokine responses (55). Thus, immunization via mu-\ncosal routes, such as the nasal or oral route, may favor the\ninduction of Th2-type responses. However, in a previous study,\nnasal immunization with P. gingivalis fimbrial protein plus CT\ninduced both Th1- and Th2-type cytokine responses in CD4\ufffd\n\nT cells of the nasal passage and submandibular glands (60). It\nmay be that the combination of nasal immunization and MBP\nis a particularly effective vaccine regimen for the induction of\nTh2-type cytokine responses.\n\nAlternatively, the effects of MBP on CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs\nmay particularly induce Th2-type responses. CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd\n\nDCs are nonmigrating resident DCs derived from a precursor,\ndistinct from monocytes, that continuously seed the lymphoid\norgans from the bone marrow. This DC subset has in common\nwith other DCs the ability to take up exogenous antigens and\nto process them for presentation on MHC class II molecules\n(50). It is known that DCs play a critical role in directing the\ndifferentiation of CD4\ufffd T cells into either Th1 or Th2 cells (3).\nIn this regard, previous studies have demonstrated that nasal\nadministration of a DNA plasmid encoding the Flt3 ligand as\nan adjuvant stimulates CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs, which, in turn,\nlead to Th2 responses (13, 27). In support of this, our separate\n\nFIG. 7.

These\nfindings suggest that MBP as a mucosal adjuvant stimulates\nCD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs, which enhance Th2 cytokine responses.\nHowever, as described above, intraperitoneal immunization\nwith a Rickettsia tsutsugamushi antigen fused with MBP in-\nduces IFN-\ufffd-producing Th1-type responses (48). It may be\nthat the phenotype of DCs induced by nasal administration of\nMBP is distinct from that of DCs induced by intraperitoneal\nadministration of MBP. This would explain why nasal but not\nparenteral immunization induces Th2 responses. This interest-\ning possibility is currently under investigation in our labora-\ntory.\n\nIt should be noted that nasal immunization of TLR4-defi-\ncient mice with 25k-hagA-MBP induced only low levels of\n25k-hagA-specific serum IgG antibody responses. Neither se-\nrum IgA nor salivary IgA antibodies against 25k-hagA were\ndetected. In this regard, a previous study has shown that MBP\ninnately activates NF-\ufffdB-mediated cytokine signaling path-\nways via TLR4 (11). To further support this, one of our sep-\narate studies has demonstrated that CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs\nwere not activated in TLR4-deficient mice after nasal immu-\nnization with 25k-hagA-MBP (Du et al., unpublished). These\nfindings suggest that MBP as an adjuvant stimulates CD11c\ufffd\n\nCD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in a TLR4-dependent manner for the induction\nof 25k-hagA-specific Th2-type cytokine responses in both mu-\ncosal and systemic compartments with subsequent serum IgG\nand IgA and mucosal IgA antibody responses.\n\nNasal administration of vaccines has been widely used for\nmucosal immunization because it delivers the antigen directly\nto nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissues without the influ-\nence of enzymes and acids in the gastrointestinal tract. How-\never, previous studies have shown that nasally administered CT\nor adenovirus vectors accumulate in the ON/E regions via the\nGM1 ganglioside (34, 54). Furthermore, CT as an adjuvant\nredirects coadministered protein Ag into these neuronal tis-\nsues (54). A clinical study suggested a strong association be-\ntween nasal influenza vaccine and Bell\u2019s palsy (40). These\nfindings raise concerns about a potential role of GM1-binding\nmolecules that target neural tissues, including the central ner-\nvous system, in nasal immunization. However, another study\nhas provided evidence that deposition of CT via the olfactory\ntissues does not lead to obvious pathological changes in brain\ntissues after nasal administration (16). Although the exact bi-\nological and pathological significance of vaccine deposition in\nthe central nervous system is uncertain, we also investigated\nthe distribution of 25k-hagA-MBP in ON/E and OB after nasal\nimmunization. Interestingly, 25k-hagA-MBP accumulations in\nthe ON/E, OB, and brain were significantly lower than those of\nCT. The biological effects of residual 25k-hagA-MBP on the\nneural tissues needs to be elucidated in the next study. Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that nasal administration of\nMBP as a chaperone component in vaccines is safer than that\nof GM1-binding molecules in terms of the potential threat\nposed by vaccines trafficking in neural tissues, including the\ncentral nervous system.\n\nIn summary, the fusion protein containing 25k-hagA and\nMBP provides a very effective means of eliciting IL-4- and\nIL-5-producing Th2-type CD4\ufffd T cells for the induction of\nserum IgG, serum IgA, and mucosal IgA antibody responses.\n\nThe mechanisms responsible for the effects of MBP are medi-\nated by increased levels of CD11c\ufffd CD8\ufffd\ufffd DCs in a TLR4-\ndependent manner. Finally, 25k-hagA-specific immune re-\nsponses induced by 25k-hagA-MBP provide protective\nimmunity against alveolar bone loss caused by P. gingivalis\ninfection. These findings suggest that nasal administration of\n25k-hagA-MBP effectively elicits protective levels of antibod-\nies against 25k-hagA and may be an effective and safe nasal\nvaccine for the immunization of humans against P. gingivalis\ninfection.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Mitsuo Hayakawa for help with the antigen preparation.\nThis work was supported by grants-in-aid for scientific research\n\n(22592102, 22390398, and 22791816) from the Japan Society for the\nPromotion of Science and by an \u201cAcademic Frontier\u201d Project for\nPrivate Universities matching fund subsidy from the Ministry of Edu-\ncation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, 2007\u20132011.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
