In the current study the effect of\nadiponectin on CCL2, -3, -4, and -5 and their corresponding receptors CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 has been\nanalyzed. Adiponectin elevates mRNA and protein of the CC chemokines in primary human monocytes.\nSimultaneously the surface abundance of CCR2 and CCR5 is reduced while CCR1 is not affected. Down-\nregulation of CCR2 by adiponectin is blocked by a CCR2 antagonist although expression of the CCL2 reg-\nulated genes CCR2 and TGF-beta 1 is not altered in the adiponectin-incubated monocytes. CCL2, -3, and -5\nconcentrations measured in supernatants of monocytes of normal-weight (NW), overweight (OW), and\ntype 2 diabetic (T2D) patients positively correlate with BMI and are increased in obesity and T2D. In con-\ntrast CCL4 is similarly abundant in the supernatants of all of these monocytes. The degree of adiponectin-\nmediated induction of the chemokines CCL3, -4, and -5 negatively correlates with their basal levels and\nupregulation of CCL3 and CCL5 is significantly impaired in OW and T2D cells. Serum concentrations of\nthese chemokines are almost equal in the three groups and do not correlate with the levels in monocyte\nsupernatants. In conclusion these data demonstrate that adiponectin stimulates release of CCL2 to CCL5\nin primary human monocytes, and induction in cells of overweight probands is partly impaired. Adipo-\nnectin also lowers surface abundance of CCR2 and CCR5 and downregulation of CCR2 seems to depend on\nautocrine/paracrine effects of CCL2.\n\n\ufffd 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nChemokines of the CC family attract mononuclear cells to sites\nof inflammation [1]. CCL2 (Chemokine CC Motif Ligand 2, also\nknown as Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1, MCP-1) is the\nmost extensively studied chemokine so far [1]. CCL2 deficiency is\nassociated with a higher susceptibility to infections and impaired\nimmune response [2,3]. However, concentrations of this chemo-\nkine are also increased in metabolic diseases and contribute to sys-\ntemic and tissue inflammation [4]. In atherosclerotic lesions higher\nCCL2 production promotes infiltration of monocytes thereby accel-\nerating foam cell formation [5]. In obesity CCL2 attracts monocytes\nto fat tissues increasing local and systemic inflammation [6]. CCL2\nmRNA expression is also found induced in peripheral monocytes of\ntype 2 diabetic patients [7]. CCL2 is the ligand of the G-protein cou-\npled receptor CCR2 whose expression is increased in monocytes of\nhypercholesterolemic and type 2 diabetes patients [8,9]. Blockage\nll rights reserved.\n\nx: +49 941 944 7019.\nburg.de (C. Buechler).\nof CCR2 or CCR2 deficiency protects from obesity, inflammation,\nand insulin resistance in rodent models of obesity [6,10].\n\nThe role of other CC chemokines including Macrophage Inflam-\nmatory Protein (MIP)-1a (CCL3), MIP-1b (CCL4), and CCL5 (Regu-\nlated on Activation Normal T-cell Expressed And Secreted,\nRANTES), and their corresponding receptors CCR1 (CCL3, CCL5)\nand CCR5 (CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5) has been less well characterized\nin metabolic diseases [1]. These chemokines are all released by\nmonocytes and their synthesis is enhanced by lipopolysaccharide\nstimulation [11]. Systemic CCL5 is increased in serum of type 2 dia-\nbetes patients [12]. Similar to CCL2 this chemokine enhances the\nrecruitment of blood monocytes to adipose tissue. Furthermore,\nCCL5 protects adipose tissue resident macrophages from apoptosis\nthereby further elevating fat inflammation [13]. In contrast CCL3\ndeficiency is not associated with altered accumulation of macro-\nphages in adipose tissue [14]. CCL4 has been mainly analyzed for\nits role in autoimmune diseases and it protects from insulitis [15].\n\nAdiponectin is an adipocyte-derived adipokine with immuno-\nregulatory, antidiabetic, and antiatherosclerotic properties\n[16,17]. Adiponectin exerts anti-inflammatory effects in activated\nmonocytes and suppression of LPS-mediated IL-6 and CXCL8\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.08.017\nmailto:christa.buechler@klinik.uni-regensburg.de\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.08.017\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n574 M. Neumeier et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 573\u2013580\nsynthesis has been shown [18,19]. In non-stimulated cells these\nproteins are even induced by adiponectin suggesting an immuno-\nregulatory function of this adipokine [20,21]. Upregulation of\nCCL2 by adiponectin has been demonstrated in cultured human\nmicrovascular endothelial cells, colonic epithelial cells, and mono-\ncytes/macrophages [20\u201322]. Adiponectin mediated induction of\nthis chemokine is even essential for the appropriate expression\nof CCL2 in response to Listeria monocytogenes infection and im-\nmune defense [23].\n\nSo far it has not been analysed whether chemokine receptors\nare altered upon adiponectin incubation. Monocytes express\nCCR1, CCR2, and CCR5, and mRNA expression is reduced upon\nLPS treatment [24]. LPS further induces internalisation and subse-\nquent degradation of CCR2 [25]. Short-term incubation of mono-\ncytes with CCL2 causes rapid CCR2 internalization but prolonged\nincubation with this chemokine induces CCR2 expression [26,27].\nTherefore, it may be speculated that at least abundance of CCR2\nis altered in adiponectin-treated monocytes because of paracrine/\nautocrine effects due to increased CCL2 concentrations.\n\nIn the current study it was analysed whether adiponectin regu-\nlates CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 and their corresponding receptors\nCCR1, -2, and -5 in primary human monocytes.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Subjects\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee\nand the investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the\nDeclaration of Helsinki (1997). Each proband gave written in-\nformed consent to participate in the study.\n\nMonocytes were isolated from the blood of 11 male T2D pa-\ntients, 12 male controls with a BMI > 25 kg/m2 (overweight control\ngroup, OW) and 10 male controls with a BMI 6 25 kg/m2 (normal-\nweight controls, NW). T2D patients were treated with drugs like\nmetformin. Further two patients were treated with ACE inhibitors,\none patient with lipid lowering drugs, and two patients with b-\nblockers. In the OW group one patient was treated with lipid low-\nering drugs. In the NW group one patient got ACE inhibitors and\none patient was treated with lipid lowering drugs. The characteris-\ntics of the study group are summarized in Table 1. This cohort in-\ncludes patient samples of recently described study groups [28,29].\n\n2.2. Material\n\nRecombinant human adiponectin expressed in a mammalian\ncell line, CCL2-, CCL3-, CCL4-, and CCL5 ELISAs were from R&D Sys-\ntems (Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). Antibodies to detect\nCCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 by flow cytometry were from R&D Systems\nTable 1\nAnthropometrical and biochemical characteristics of the study groups used for the isolatio\n\nT2D OW\n\nProbands (n) n = 11 n = 12\nAge 62 (42\u201376) 56 (4\nBMI (kg/m2) 32.7 (27.3\u201345.9) 30.4 (\nWHR 1.07 (0.91\u20131.10) 1.00 (\nGlucose (mg/dl) 143 (100\u2013171) 105 (\n\nChemokine and adiponectin serum concentrations\n\nCCL2 (pg/ml) 30.5 (13.0\u201370.1) 25.0 (\nCCL3 (pg/ml) 325.6 (0.5\u2013788.5) 326.1\nCCL4 (pg/ml) 19.8 (14.5\u201339.7) 30.5 (\nCCL5 (ng/ml) 55.0 (7.5\u2013120.0) 64.7 (\nAdiponectin (lg/ml) 1.6 (0.6\u20133.8) 2.5 (1\n\nBody mass index (BMI), normal-weight controls (NW), overweight controls (OW), type\nSignificance of T2D versus OW = 1, of OW versus NW = 2, of T2D versus NW = 3.\n(Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). Immunoblot analysis was\ndone using antibodies for CCR1, -2 and -5 from Biozol (Eching, Ger-\nmany). Anti-mouse PE-conjugated IgG antibody was from DAKO\n(Glostrup, Denmark). CCR2 antagonist RS-102895 was from Sigma\nBioscience (Deisenhofen, Germany) and 20 lM were used.\n\n2.3. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\n\nReal-time PCR was performed using LightCycler FastStart DNA\nMaster SYBR Green I from Roche (Mannheim, Germany) as described\nelsewhere [21,30]. The primer sequences are listed in Table 2. Data\nwere normalized to b-actin mRNA levels. The specificity of the PCRs\nwas confirmed by sequencing of the PCR fragments (Geneart,\nRegensburg, Germany).\n\n2.4. Isolation and culture of primary blood monocytes\n\nPeripheral blood leukocytes were isolated from 40 ml of whole\nblood using Vacutainer CPT systems (Becton Dickinson, Franklin\nLakes, NJ) as described [31]. Primary human monocytes were puri-\nfied by magnetic separation with CD14 beads (Miltenyi Biotec,\nBergisch Gladbach, Germany). Serum was coagulated with Throm-\nborel S (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and CaCl2 (Calbiochem-\nMerck, Darmstadt, Germany) and was dialyzed two times against\nphosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h each. Flow cytometry anal-\nysis revealed that about 95% of the isolated cells were monocytes\n[31]. 3 \ufffd 106 monocytes were cultivated in 3 ml RPMI supple-\nmented with 10% autologous serum for 24 h. Subsequently, the\nmedium was replaced with 1 ml fresh medium. For adiponectin\nstimulation monocytes were incubated for 24 h with 10 lg/ml\nadiponectin until indicated otherwise. Cells and supernatants were\ncollected 24 h later and used for ELISA and western blot analysis.\n\n2.5. Elisa\n\nELISAs were performed as recommended by the distributor.\nSupernatants were diluted 10-fold to measure CCL2, 4-fold to mea-\nsure CCL3, 2-fold to measure CCL4, and 5-fold to measure CCL5.\nCCL5 serum levels are in the ng/ml range and concentrations added\nto the monocyte culture medium were subtracted before perform-\ning calculations. Serum was used undiluted for CCL2 and CCL4\ndeterminations, 2-fold diluted for CCL3 and 100-fold diluted for\nCCL5 determinations.\n\n2.6. Immunoblot\n\nCells were solubilized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis\nbuffer.

Flow cytometry\n\nMonocytes of four (CCR1 measurement) to six (CCR2 and CCR5\nanalysis) different donors were isolated and 5 \ufffd 106 cells were cul-\ntivated on petriPERM dishes (Sarstedt, N\u00fcrnbrecht, Germany) for\n24 h as described above. Medium was replaced and cells were\nincubated with or without recombinant adiponectin (10 lg/ml)\nfor 24 h. For cell removal, petriPERM dishes were placed on a cold\nmetal block for 10 min and cells were collected in cold PBS. After\ncentrifugation, cells were incubated on ice for 1 h with 25 lg/ml\nCCR1, CCR2 or CCR5 antibody or the respective isotypes, IgG1 (iso-\ntype for CCR2 and CCR5 antibodies) and IgG2b (isotype for CCR1\nantibodies). Following, cells were washed with cold PBS, resus-\npended in 100 ll ice-cold PBS and incubated with anti-mouse\nR0439 PE-conjugated antibody (1:50-fold diluted) for 45 min on\nice in the dark. Subsequently cells were washed with ice-cold\nFig. 1.

Statis-\ntical differences were analyzed by two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U\nTest or Students\u0301 t-test for paired samples and a value of p < 0.05\nwas regarded as significant. The Spearman-Rho correlation was\ncalculated using the PASW Statistics 17.0 software.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Adiponectin upregulates chemokine mRNA and protein in human\nmonocytes\n\nMonocytes were isolated from the blood of two normal-weight\ndonors and were incubated with different concentrations of adipo-\nnectin for 24 h. Release of CCL2, -3, -4 and -5 was dose-depen-\ndently increased when 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 lg/ml adiponectin\nwere used (Fig. 1A\u2013D). Higher concentrations of 12.5 and 15 lg/\nml did not further elevate CCL3 and CCL4 whereas CCL2 and\nCCL5 even tended to be decreased (Fig. 1A\u2013D). Therefore, 10 lg/\nml adiponectin was used for further studies.\n\nChemokines were measured in the supernatants of monocytes\nisolated from the blood of eight normal-weight donors and subse-\nquently cultivated with or without 10 lg/ml adiponectin for 24 h.\nCCL3, -4, and -5 were all significantly increased in the supernatants\nof adiponectin-treated cells (Fig. 2B\u2013D), as well as CCL2 which has\nalready been described to be induced by adiponectin [17]\n) CCL2, (B) CCL3, (C) CCL4, and (D) CCL5 in the supernatants of monocytes incubated\no independent experiments are shown as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean.\n\n\n\nFig. 2.

CCL3 was significantly more induced than CCL2 and CCL5\nand tended to be more efficiently upregulated compared to CCL4\nwhereas the effect of adiponectin on CCL2, CCL4, and CCL5 was sim-\nilar (Fig. 2E). The mRNA expression of these chemokines was ana-\nlysed by real-time RT-PCR in monocytes isolated from the blood\nof five different donors and was found significantly enhanced in\nthe adiponectin-incubated cells (p = 0.034 for CCL2, p = 0.017 for\nCCL3, p = 0.026 for CCL4 and p = 0.030 for CCL5). The effect on\nCCL3 mRNA levels was higher compared to CCL5 induction (Fig. 2F).\n\n3.2. Adiponectin lowers abundance of chemokine receptors on the cell\nsurface\n\nSurface abundance of CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 was analysed by\nflow cytometry and representative results are shown in Fig. 3A.\nIn monocytes of four different donors incubated with adiponectin\nfor 24 h surface levels of CCR1 were not altered (Fig. 3B). CCR2\nand CCR5 were significantly reduced when monocytes of six differ-\nent donors were analysed and CCR2 was significantly more sup-\npressed than CCR5 (Fig. 3B). When monocytes of three different\ndonors were preincubated with the CCR2 receptor antagonist RS-\n102895 for 2 h adiponectin-mediated downregulation of CCR2\nwas abrogated (Fig. 3C). Further, this antagonist significantly re-\nduced surface CCR2 abundance (Fig. 3C). Chemokine receptor pro-\ntein was analysed in the cell lysates of monocytes of 10 donors\n(Fig. 3D and data not shown) and were not reduced upon adiponec-\ntin incubation (Fig. 3E). Chemokine receptor mRNA expression was\ndetermined in monocytes of eight different donors and was not\nsignificantly changed (Fig. 3F).\n\n3.3. Chemokine levels in cells of normal-weight, overweight, and type\n2 diabetes patients\n\nChemokine levels were also measured in the supernatants of\nmonocytes isolated from the blood of normal-weight controls\n(NW, 10 donors), overweight donors (OW, 12 donors), and T2D pa-\ntients (11 donors) (Table 1). The levels of CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5\nwere all increased in cells of OW and T2D probands compared to\nNW (Fig. 4A, B and D). CCL5 was even higher in the supernatants\nof T2D compared to OW cells (Fig. 4D). CCL4, however, was simi-\nlarly concentrated in the supernatants of all of these cells\n(Fig. 4C). Because chemokine levels were highly variable the\nlog(10) levels were used for further calculations and a positive cor-\nrelation of logCCL2 (r = 0.576, p < 0.001), logCCL3 (r = 0.578,\np = 0.001) and logCCL5 (r = 0.686, p < 0.001) but not logCCL4\n(r = 0.217, p = 0.225) with BMI was identified (Fig. 4E\u2013H). Further-\nmore, levels of all chemokine were correlated to each other even\nwhen adjusted for BMI (Table 3) but not to systemic adiponectin\nconcentrations (data not shown).\n\n3.4. Effect of adiponectin on chemokine levels in cells of normal-\nweight, overweight, and type 2 diabetes patients\n\nThe effect of adiponectin to induce these chemokines was also\ntested. Here, induction of CCL3 and CCL5 was significantly impaired\nin monocytes of OW compared to NW donors (p = 0.009 for CCL3\nand p = 0.036 for CCL5) and in cells of T2D compared to NW mono-\ncytes (p < 0.001 for CCL3 and p = 0.006 for CCL5). Adiponectin-med-\niated upregulation of the chemokines was similar in OW and T2D\nmonocytes (Fig. 5A and B). The degrees of adiponectin-induced\nupregulation of CCL3 and CCL5 showed a strong negative correlation\nto BMI (r = \ufffd0.599, p < 0.001 for CCL3 and r = \ufffd0.399, p = 0.021 for\nCCL5) and were positively correlated to each other (r = 0.668,\np < 0.001) suggesting that similar regulatory pathways are involved\n(Fig. 5C and data not shown). The latter association was even highly\nsignificant after adjusting for BMI (r = 0.638, p < 0.001). The degree\nof adiponectin-induced upregulation of CCL4 was negatively associ-\nated with basal logCCL4 levels (r = \ufffd0.720, p < 0.001, Fig. 5D).\nUpregulation of CCL2 by adiponectin was neither associated with\nits basal levels nor BMI of the blood donors.\n\n\n\nFig. 3.

Systemic levels of CCL2,\nCCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 did not correlate with age, BMI, waist to\nhip ratio, serum adiponectin or fasting glucose of the patients.\nThere was a modest positive correlation of systemic CCL3 and\nCCL5 (r = 0.386, p = 0.026).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn the current study we confirmed previous data showing that\nadiponectin upregulates CCL2 in primary human monocytes\n[20,32]. Further, induction of CCL2 mRNA is demonstrated suggest-\ning that transcriptional mechanisms are involved. Besides CCL2,\nthe mRNA and protein levels of the chemokines CCL3, -4, and -5\nare also significantly induced by adiponectin. CCL2 is the ligand\nof CCR2, CCL3 and CCL5 are ligands of CCR1 whereas CCL3, CCL4,\nand CCL5 bind to CCR5 [1]. Neither mRNA nor total protein levels\nof these receptors are altered by adiponectin incubation. However,\nsurface abundance of CCR2 is about 4-fold reduced and CCR5 is\nabout 2-fold lower in adiponectin incubated cells. CCR1 surface\nlevels are not reduced by adiponectin. Lower surface levels of at\nleast CCR2 seem to be secondary effects of ligand binding because\nits downregulation by adiponectin is completely blocked by a CCR2\nantagonist. Reduced numbers of cell-surface localized chemokine\nreceptors may desensitize those cells for further chemokine-asso-\nciated signaling events. Interestingly this antagonist significantly\nlowers CCR2 surface levels in control- and adiponectin-incubated\ncells.\n\nRecently it has been shown that CCL2 upregulates CCR2 and\nTGF-beta 1 mRNA in monocytes [27] but neither CCR2 nor TGF-\nbeta 1 (own unpublished data) expression are increased in the\nadiponectin incubated cells. Cells studied herein were incubated\nfor 24 h with adiponectin whereas Sakai et al. mainly analysed\nmonocytes which were cultivated with CCL2 for 48 h, and shorter\nincubation time used herein may partly explain these different\nfindings.\n\nAlthough adiponectin levels have been found reduced in obesity\nand metabolic syndrome [33,34] systemic concentration are similar\nin the cohort analysed herein. Recent work has demonstrated high-\ner adiponectin in patients with impaired renal function and adipo-\nnectin has been identified to even predict an increased risk for\ncoronary heart disease [35,36]. Therefore, adiponectin levels are af-\nfected by renal dysfunction and coronary heart disease and some of\nthe probands studied herein may have suffered from these compli-\ncations. Further, the cohorts studied may have been too small to\ndemonstrate lower adiponectin in obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nAdiponectin concentrations used in the in vitro studies herein\nare four- to five-fold higher compared to median systemic levels\nof the study cohort analysed. Dose\u2013response curves demonstrate\na maximal effect when 10 lg/ml recombinant adiponectin is used.\nWhen analysing primary cells varying basal chemokine levels and\ndistinct responses to adiponectin are expected. This led us to use\n\n\n\nFig. 4. CCL2 to -5 in the supernatants of monocytes isolated from the blood of type 2 diabetic patients (T2D), overweight (OW) and normal weight controls (NW).

Neumeier et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 573\u2013580\nthe most effective concentration of adiponectin to assure that the\ncells of all donors respond to this adipokine. Several studies have\nshown that effects of adiponectin are impaired in obesity and type\n2 diabetes [30,37\u201340] and higher adipokine concentrations may be\nnecessary to stimulate the cells.\n\nImpaired adiponectin-mediated upregulation of CCL3 and CCL5\nis also detected in T2D and OW cells compared to NW monocytes.\nThe induction of CCL3 and CCL5 by adiponectin shows a strong po-\nsitive correlation to each other and is even negatively associated\nwith BMI of the respective blood donors. These findings suggest\nthat monocyte CCL3 and CCL5 synthesis are similarly regulated\nby adiponectin and this pathway is partly blocked by factors af-\nfected in cells of overweight and obese blood donors. In addition,\na positive correlation of CCL3 and CCL5 levels is also found in the\nmonocyte supernatants and in serum of the blood donors.\n\nCCL2 and CCL4 are similarly induced by adiponectin in the\nmonocytes of NW, OW and T2D patients. Whereas the induction\nof CCL2 by adiponectin is not related to its basal levels or BMI of\nthe donors, a strong negative correlation of basal CCL4 and adipo-\nnectin mediated upregulation of CCL4 independent of BMI has\nbeen identified. This might indicate that monocytes with a higher\nbasal release of CCL4 are more resistant to adiponectin-mediated\nupregulation of CCL4. However, neither the exact pathways in-\nvolved in adiponectin-induced chemokine induction nor the rea-\nson for higher basal monocyte CCL4 synthesis have been\nanalysed so far and future studies are needed to evaluate the\nunderlying mechanisms.\n\nThe data discussed above indicate that different signal trans-\nduction pathways are involved in the upregulation of the chemo-\nkines studied herein. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that\nthere is no general resistance to adiponectin effects in state of\nobesity or type 2 diabetes. In fact only specific signal transduction\npathways seem to be affected. Similar results have recently been\nobtained in fat-loaded hepatocytes where only certain actions of\nadiponectin are blocked [41].\n\nAdiponectin binds to different receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2,\nwhich are both expressed in monocytes [30,42] and signaling of\n\n\n\nFig. 5.

Neumeier et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 573\u2013580 579\njust one pathway may be disturbed in obesity. Various adiponectin\nreceptor downstream effectors including p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, AMP-\nactivated protein kinase and NFjB have been identified [42\u201344]\nand activity of specific molecules may be differentially affected\nin obesity.\n\nRecently we described that LPS-induced release of these chemo-\nkines is similar in monocytes of controls and T2D patients [11] sug-\ngesting that anthropometrical and disease-related factors affect\nonly some pathways as described for adiponectin herein.\n\nBasal levels of CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 are all increased in the\nsupernatants of OW and T2D monocytes indicating that higher\nsynthesis is related to BMI and not to type 2 diabetes. Interestingly,\nlevels of these chemokines in the supernatants of the monocytes\ncorrelates positively with BMI of the blood donors. CCL4, however,\nis similarly abundant in all of the supernatants and not associated\nwith BMI.\n\nNone other than CCL5 is modestly higher in T2D cells compared\nto monocytes of BMI-matched controls. CCL5 at least in serum has\nbeen suggested to be involved in the development of T2D indepen-\ndent of classical risk factors like BMI and dyslipidemia [12]. Low-\ndose insulin infusion in T2D significantly reduces mononuclear cell\nCCL5 but not CCL2 expression suggesting that impaired insulin\nactivity may contribute to increased monocyte CCL5 in T2D pa-\ntients [45]. CCL5 and CCL2 serum levels are reduced upon insulin\ninfusion indicating that at least systemic CCL2 is not influenced\nby its synthesis in mononuclear cells [45].\n\nLevels of CCL2 and CCL5 have been found increased in serum of\ntype 2 diabetes patients when analyzing rather large cohorts\n[9,12], and the low number of patient samples studied herein\nmay explain why this increase has not been confirmed. Further,\nchemokines in serum do not correlate with the respective chemo-\nkines in the monocyte supernatants. The chemokines analysed\nherein are synthesized by various cells and tissues [46\u201348], and\ntherefore, it is unlikely that monocyte released protein consider-\nably affect systemic levels.\n\nIn summary this study shows that adiponectin stimulates syn-\nthesis of CCL2 to CCL5 in primary human monocytes, and release\nof CCL3 and -5 is impaired in obesity. Surface abundance of CCR2\nand -5 is reduced in adiponectin-incubated monocytes suggesting\nthat this adipokine regulates CC-chemokine activity at the ligand\nand receptor level.\nDuality of interest statement\n\nThe authors declare that there is no duality of interest associ-\nated with this manuscript.\nAuthor contributions\n\nStudy concept and design: CB, HB, AS.
