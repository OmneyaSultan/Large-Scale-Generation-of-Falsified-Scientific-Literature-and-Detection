Deregulation of FGFR signaling\ncan lead to cancer development. Here, we report an FGFR inhibitor, SSR128129E (SSR), that binds to the\nextracellular part of the receptor. SSR does not compete with FGF for binding to FGFR but inhibits FGF-\ninduced signaling linked to FGFR internalization in an allostericmanner, as shown by crystallography studies,\nnuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, free\nenergy calculations, structure-activity relationship analysis, and FGFR mutagenesis. Overall, SSR is a small\nmolecule allosteric inhibitor of FGF/FGFR signaling, acting via binding to the extracellular part of the FGFR.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nReceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) constitute a major class of\n\ndrug targets (Overington et al., 2006). Most efforts have been\n\ninvested in developing agents that orthosterically compete for\n\nbinding between RTKs with their endogenous ligands, such as\n\nantibodies recognizing growth factors or their receptors or small\nSignificance\n\nFGF receptors (FGFRs) belong to the receptor tyrosine kina\nnumerous (patho-)physiological processes and a key target fo\ndomains of RTKs are traditionally antibodies, but small chemi\ninhibiting RTK signaling, have not been described yet.

Only a few drugs that interact\n\nwith allosteric sites have been developed for ion channels and\n\nG protein-coupled receptors (Christopoulos, 2002; Conn et al.,\n\n2009) and kinases (Zhang et al., 2009).

After screening >105 compounds and\n\nchemical optimization, one compound (SSR128129E, abbrevi-\n\nated as \u2018\u2018SSR\u2019\u2019) inhibited 125I-FGF2 binding with mM affinity,\n\nalthough this effect was not saturated (Bono et al., 2013). These\n\nfindings suggested amodulation in fibroblast growth factor (FGF)\n\nbinding but not necessarily binding competition. Further, SSR\n\nreduced FGFR phosphorylation but did not cross the plasma\n\nmembrane, while inhibiting cell proliferation at nM potency. The\n\ndiscrepancy of the inhibition constants between the SPA results\n\nand proliferation assay led us to investigate the molecular mech-\n\nanisms of SSR. Pharmacological experiments showed that this\n\ncompound inhibited FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling via an allo-\n\nsteric mechanism (Bono et al., 2013), which we studied in more\n\nmolecular detail here.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSSR128129E Inhibits FGFR andBinds to Its Extracellular\nDomain\nWe identified SSR128129E, referred to as \u2018\u2018SSR\u2019\u2019 (Figure 1A),\n\nwhich inhibited the binding of 125I-FGF2 to the extracellular\n\ndomain (ECD) of FGFR1 at mM concentrations in a SPA assay\n\n(Bono et al., 2013). SSR dose-dependently inhibited the survival\n\nof endothelial cells (ECs) (IC50 < 30 nM; Figure 1B).\n\nSince SSR\u2019s effects on FGFR signaling did not result from an\n\ninhibition of FGF binding to FGFRs (Bono et al., 2013), impaired\n\ndimerization of FGFRs or FGF ligands (Figures S1A and S1B\n490 Cancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc.\navailable online), or TK inhibition (Figure 1C), we used satura-\n\ntion transfer difference (STD)-nuclear magnetic resonance\n\n(NMR) to analyze if, after FGFR irradiation, the NMR signal (satu-\n\nration) would spread to SSR, which would indicate that SSR\n\ninteracts with FGF. However, SSR did not bind FGF1 or FGF2\n\n(Figure S1C).\n\nWe assessed if SSR bound FGFR-ECD, in which D2 and D3\n\nconstitute the major binding site for FGFs and coreceptors.\n\nSTD-NMR showed that SSR bound all constructs containing\n\nD2 and/or D3 (Table S1). Figure 1D shows the STD-NMR spectra\n\nof FGFR1 and FGFR4 with SSR. Together with the functional\n\nassays, these data suggest a direct (orthosteric) or indirect\n\n(allosteric) inhibition of FGF binding to ECD of FGFR and/or the\n\nbiological function of the receptor.\n\nSSR Inhibits FGF-Induced Signaling and Endocytosis\nPathways\nTo dissect how SSR interfered with FGFR, we studied its effect\n\non ERK1/2 activation and FGFR endocytosis. SSR blocked the\n\nFGF2-induced increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 2A)\n\nand translocation of cell surface FGFR4 to the cytosol (Fig-\n\nure 2B). In addition, SSR inhibited the FGF2-induced intracellular\n\naccumulation of early endosomal antigen1 positive (EEA1+) vesi-\n\ncles, the destination of internalized FGFRs (Figures 2C and 2D).\n\nSimilar effects of SSR on FGFR internalization and phosphoryla-\n\ntion of FRS-2 (target of FGFR2) and ERK1/2 were observed in\n\nhuman gastric SNU-16 cancer cells, in which these processes\n\nrely on FGF7/FGFR2 (Figures 2E and 2F), and in FGFR2-overex-\n\npressing L6 cells (see below). Blockage of FGFR internalization\n\ncould explain the inhibition of FGFR signaling, though other opin-\n\nions exist (Belleudi et al., 2007; Reilly et al., 2004).\n\n\n\nA B\n\nC D\n\nE\nF\n\nFigure 2.

Peaks in this spectrum correspond to amide groups (and\n\nnitrogen-containing side-chains). Since chemical shift perturba-\n\ntions (CSPs) of these peaks are sensitive to the chemical envi-\n\nronment, this technique allows identification of SSR interaction\n\nsites with FGFR-ECD.\n\nThe spectrum of D2 showed sharp peaks and spectral disper-\n\nsion, as expected for a well-folded domain with defined struc-\nture, and all NMR resonances were assigned to a particular\n\nresidue. In contrast, the signals of D3 could not be detected,\n\nbecause they were broadened beyond detection, indicating\n\nthat D3 does not adopt a stable, persistent three-dimensional\n\n(3D)-fold (Figures S2A\u2013S2F). This behavior is consistent with\n\na transiently unfolded flexible state, a phenomenon confirmed\n\nby D30s high tendency to aggregate (data not shown). Because\nthis behavior can be an inherent property of the domain or,\n\nalternatively, a preparation artifact compromising the analysis\n\nof a potential interaction with SSR, we generated preparations\n\nof functional, structured D3. However, optimization of condi-\n\ntions to solubilize D3, variations of D3 constructs (with/without\nCancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc. 491\n\n\n\nCancer Cell\n\nMechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs\nmembrane or D2D3-Linker), or attachment of solubilizing fusion\n\nconstructs (thioredoxin, protein G) all failed to yield spectra\n\nconsistent with a stable D3 fold, while the other domains re-\n\nmained readily detectable (Figures S2A\u2013S2D).\n\nSuch a very flexible (intrinsically disordered; Tompa, 2011)\n\nstate of proteins can be characterized by computer simulations\n\nthat estimate the preferred conformational state and stability of\n\nvarious parts of the protein. We therefore performed multi-ms-\n\nlong, unbiased, all-atom, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics\n\n(MD) computer simulations with the Amber99SB*-ILDN force\n\nfield. In line with NMR data, D3 was marginally stable and\n\npartially disordered in solution. The Thr319-Arg330 region, which\n\nhas an extended b-conformation in the crystal structure, tended\n\nto adopt an a-helical conformation and to detach from the\n\nprotein core, leading to partial unfolding of the domain. Plasticity\n\nof this region, in particular of the bC0-bE loop (Pro307-Val332)\nplays a key role in the specificity of FGF binding to FGFR splice\n\nvariants (Beenken and Mohammadi, 2009). Noteworthy, the\n\nalgorithm AGADIR also predicted a propensity for a helix confor-\n\nmation of the Thr319-Arg330 region, thus independently confirm-\n\ning the MD computer simulations.\n\nTo assess if the flexibility of D3 corresponds to a completely\n\nrandom (random coil) or compact but unfolded (molten globule\n\n[MG]) state and to verify the chemical purity and quality of the\n\nprotein used in the NMR experiments, we performed FGFR2-\n\nD2D3 crystallization trials. We resolved a similar structure of\n\nthe FGFR2-FGF1 complex, as reported (Plotnikov et al., 1999;\n\nSchlessinger et al., 2000). A defined electron density of D3 re-\n\nvealed a stable structure, suggesting that D3 is only marginally\n\nunstable and ready to fold in conditions of crystallization and/\n\nor upon forces taking place in the crystal. These observations\n\nare compatible with a molten globule state of D3 (in line with\n\nthe increased aggregation propensity and disappearance of\n\nNMR peaks). Control experiments showed that the amino acid\n\ncomposition of the urea-unfolded D2D3 polypeptide chain\n\nwas correct (Figures S2E and S2F), that D3 folding was not en-\n\nforced by crystallization conditions (Figures S2G and S2H),\n\nand that D2D3 interactedwith FGF1 (Figures S2Gand S2I). Since\n\nthe crystal structure indicates that D2 and D3 are needed to\n\ninteract with FGF (Plotnikov et al., 1999; Schlessinger et al.,\n\n2000), these findings show that D3 is present and functional.\n\nThus, D2 is well folded, while D3 is in an unfolded MG state\n\nthat is ready to fold.\n\nMode of Action of SSR: Effects on D2\nWe then explored to which sites SSR binds in the FGFR ECD and\n\nused 2DNMR to determine the CSP values upon addition of SSR\n\nto D2 of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4. SSR-induced CSPs were\n\nmapped on the X-ray structure of FGF2/FGFR1-D2D3/heparin\n\n(Protein Data Bank [PDB] code 1FQ9; Schlessinger et al.,\n\n2000). The CSPs suggested a conserved binding site of SSR in\n\nthe vicinity of\u2014but not overlapping with\u2014the heparin binding\n\nsite of D2 (red balls show residues interacting with SSR in D2\n\nof FGFRs; Figures 3A and 3B). Chemical shift titration analysis\n\nyielded a binding affinity of SSR to D2 of FGFR1, \ufffd2 and \ufffd4 in\nthe mM range (Table S2). These affinities are two to three orders\n\nof magnitude too low to explain the mM SPA data. Moreover, the\n\ncomputational estimation of the free binding energy of SSR to\n\nFGFR2-D2 (\ufffd5 kcal/mol) is in line with the mM range of the\n492 Cancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc.\nobserved KD values (Figure 3C). Thus, an interaction of SSR\n\nwith D2 alone cannot account for the cellular effects.\n\nWe therefore performed binding experiments with FGF/FGFR\n\ncomplexes. Since NMR signals only appear if the protein is\n\nlabeled with 15N isotope, FGFR or FGF was labeled separately\n\nto dissect to which component SSR binds. The effect of\n\nSSR on the 2D NMR spectra of (15N)FGFR2-D2D3/FGF1 and\n\nFGFR1-D1D2D3/(15N)FGF2 is shown in Figure 3D and mapped\n\non the crystal structure 1FQ9 in Figure 3E. The spatial CSP clus-\n\ntering indicates a binding site for SSR at the interface between\n\nD2 and FGF, in agreement with the binding of SSR to D2 alone.\n\nConfirming STD-NMR experiments that SSR does not bind to\n\nFGF1 or FGF2, SSR induced CSPs in FGF only when a FGF/\n\nFGFR complex was formed. When analyzing the complex\n\nbetween FGFR1-D1D2D3 and (15N)FGF2, two additional CSPs\n\nwere observed: Asn101 (facing D2 in crystal structure 1FQ9)\n\nand Ala57 (facing D3; black circle in Figure 3E, bottom), suggest-\n\ning an additional binding site for SSR in D3. To evaluate SSR\u2019s\n\naffinity for FGFR/FGF, we performed NMR titration experiments\n\nof FGF1/FGFR1-D1D2D3 with SSR, yielding an affinity constant\n\nin the low mM range (\ufffd50 mM; Figure 3F). Due to the structural\ndisorder of D3, a binding mode could not be deduced. Together,\n\nthe CSP data indicate a binding site on the interface between\n\nFGF and D2 and a potential binding site on D3. A role for D3 in\n\nSSR binding is supported by the mM affinity of SSR to D2 alone,\n\ntoo low to explain the biological effect.\n\nMode of Action of SSR: Low Resolution FGF-FGFR\nCrystals\nTo further assess themolecular basis of the allosteric interaction,\n\nwe performed X-ray crystallography. Crystals of FGF1/FGFR2-\n\nD2D3 complexes with SSR could not be optimized to a suitable\n\ndiffraction quality, but it was possible to generate crystals with\n\nSR128545 (abbreviated as \u2018\u2018SR\u2019\u2019; Figure S3A), a SSR analog\n\nwith comparable cellular activity (Figure S3B). Limited by a\n\ndiffraction resolution of 4.2 A\u030a, the exact binding position of SR\n\ncould not be visualized, but conformational protein backbone\n\nchanges induced by the interaction with SR were detectable.\n\nMolecular replacement (MR) statistics of Phaser (McCoy et al.,\n\n2007) were used to compare the observed X-ray diffraction\n\npattern to existing 3D models. This revealed single solutions\n\nwithout structural clashes when independently using the three\n\nseparate domains (FGF1, FGFR2-D2, and FGFR2-D3) of the\n\nFGF1/FGFR2/heparin crystal structure (PDB code 1E0O; Pelle-\n\ngrini et al., 2000). These results confirm that the obtained crystal\n\nstructures were in agreement with published results (PDB codes\n\n1CVS and 1DJS). We also analyzed the translation function\n\nZ-scores (TFZ), as they are a measure of how well the MRmodel\n\nfits to X-ray data (a high score indicates a good match). TFZ\n\nscores in the presence of SR were smaller for D3 than for D2\n\nor FGF1 (FGF1/SR = 23.1, FGFR2-D2/SR = 15.7, and FGFR2-\n\nD3/SR = 7.5), showing that the structure solution cannot explain\n\nthe entire scattering pattern in the presence of SR but rather\n\nsuggests a structural change induced by SR.\n\nTo confirm the above findings and to determine conforma-\n\ntional dynamics, we refined the structure of the FGFR2-D2D3/\n\nFGF1/heparin/SR complex by generating polyalanine models\n\nusing Refmac5 to obtain a model that best explains the experi-\n\nmental data (Murshudov et al., 1996).

By ob-\n\ntaining an infrared spectrum of absorption,\n\nFTIR provides information on the transition\n\nfrom one to another conformation. Addition\n\nof SSR to FGFR2-D2D3 increased the\n\namplitude of the amide I band in the FTIR\n\nspectrum with a maximum at 1,640 cm\ufffd1\n\n(Figure 4B), suggesting that binding of\n\nSSR leads to a conformational change of\n\nFGFR-D2D3 (similar results were obtained\n\nwhen analyzing FGFR2-D1D2D3), in agree-\n\nment with the AGADIR prediction.\n\nWe used state-of-the-art free energy (DG)\n\ncalculations and computer modeling to\n\nunravel how the conformational landscape\n\nand flexibility of D3 changed in the presence\n\nof SSR. The free energy calculations were\n\nperformed with the Gromacs 4 package\n\nand PLUMED plug-in using metadynamics,\n\nbias exchange metadynamics, and steered\n\nMD approaches and the Amber99SB*-ILDN\n\nforce-field (Best and Hummer, 2009; Piana\n\nand Laio, 2007). Similar techniques were\n\nused previously to predict the free energy\n\nlandscapes associated with conformational\n\nchanges and ligand binding in kinases\n\n(Lovera et al., 2012; Saladino et al., 2012).\n\nComparison of the free energy landscapes\nof D3 as a function of the b sheet and a helix content predicted\n\nthat SSR stabilizes helix a1 (Thr319-Ile324) and induces a b sheet\n\nto a helix transition of part of b5 (Gln325-Ile329), thereby nearly\n\ndoubling the number of turns in helix a1. As a result, D3\n\nundergoes a conformational rearrangement into an intermediate\n\n\n\nCancer Cell\n\nMechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs\n\u2018\u2018H1\u2019\u2019 state, which progresses to state \u2018\u2018H2,\u2019\u2019 where a new hydro-\n\nphobic cavity, not accessible in the native form of D3, is formed,\n\nin which the hydrophobic Tyr328 residue (solvent exposed in the\n\nnative configuration) now faces the core of D3 (Figures 4C and\n\nS3C). The difference in free energy between the crystallo-\n\ngraphic fold of D3 and the refolded H2 state, calculated by two\n\nindependent approaches (bias exchange metadynamics and\n\nsteered MD simulations) was 2 to 3 kcal/mol. These data, in\n\nagreement with NMR and X-ray observations, suggest that D3\n\nbinds SSR and undergoes conformational rearrangements\n\nwithout becoming fully structured in the SSR-bound state.\n\nMode of Action of SSR: Helix-Breaker Mutations\nTo assess the importance of Tyr328 in the conformational\n\nchanges of FGFR-D3, we mutated this residue to aspartate,\n\nwhich has known \u2018\u2018helix-breaker\u2019\u2019 properties (to yield FGFR2-\n\nD2D3Y328D, termed FGFR2Y328D), as this mutation should reduce\n\nthe helical tendency and impair the conformational change.\n\nIndeed, we hypothesized that the hydrophilic Asp328 would\n\ndestabilize the a-helical conformation and that SSR would not\n\nbe able to induce a conformational change in FGFR2Y328D.\n\nFTIR revealed that FGFR2Y328D did not exhibit a major shift in\n\nits spectrum in the absence of SSR, showing that its overall 3D\n\nconfiguration was preserved. Conformational analysis by FTIR\n\nshowed, however, that SSR failed to induce a change in the\n\nspectrum of FGFR2Y328D (Figure 4B). This effect was specific,\n\nas additional mutations of the Y328 residue (Y328R/I329K) still\n\nshowed the same structural change as FGFR2WT upon addition\n\nof SSR, illustrating that not any type of mutation of Y328 per se\n\ncould rescue the SSR effects (data not shown).\n\nThe aforementioned observations suggest that SSR does not\n\ndirectly compete with FGF binding, but rather that it alters the\n\nconformational ensemble of FGFR-ECD, which allosterically\n\npropagates into receptor function changes. The b to a transition\n\nof the b5 helix (Glu325-Ile329) is critically involved in this allosteric\n\neffect. To assess the relevance of Tyr328 in transmitting SSR\u2019s\n\nallosteric activity, we generated HEK293 cell lines expressing\n\nwild-type FGFR2WT or mutant FGFR2Y328D. In the absence of\n\nSSR, FGFR2WT and FGFR2Y328D cells exhibited a similar\n\nERK1/2 response to FGF2, showing that the mutation did not\n\nchange FGFR\u2019s response to FGF. The mutation did also not alter\n\northosteric binding of 125I-FGF2 (KD: 54 \u00b1 8 pM for FGFR2\nWT\n\nversus 52 \u00b1 9 pM for FGFR2Y328D; n = 5; p = NS). However,\n\nSSR\u2019s ability to inhibit FGF2-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation\n\nwas reduced in FGFR2Y328D cells (IC50 value: 121 \u00b1 30 nM) as\n\ncompared to FGFR2WT cells (IC50 value: 28 \u00b1 12 nM; p < 0.05)\n\n(Figures 5A and 5B). Similar data were obtained for FGFR2 phos-\n\nphorylation and phospho-FRS2 signaling (Figures 5C and 5D).\n\nWe also stably overexpressed FGFR2WT or FGFR2Y328D in L6\n\nmyoblast cells (which lack endogenous FGFRs). Transduced\n\ncells were treated with AlexaFluor488-conjugated FGF2, leading\n\nto the formation of FGF2/FGFR2 at the cell membrane and its\n\ninternalization in endocytic vesicles. Upon stimulation, FGFR2WT\n\nand FGFR2Y328D were comparably endocytosed (Figures 5E and\n\n5F). Notably, SSR reduced endocytosis in FGFR2WT but not in\n\nFGFR2Y328D cells (Figures 5E and 5F). To unravel the endocytic\n\npathway, inhibitors of clathrin- (Pitstop2) and caveolin-depen-\n\ndent (Dyngo-4a) pathways were used. Only Dyngo-4a affected\n\nendocytosis of FGFR2WT and FGFR2Y328D, indicating that the\nFGF2 endocytic pathway relies on caveolae-dependent internal-\n\nization (Figures 5E and 5F), consistent with previous reports\n\n(Irschick et al., 2013). Thus, FGFR2WT and FGFR2Y328D showed\n\nsimilar profiles with respect to FGF2 affinity, ERK1/2 phosphor-\n\nylation, and receptor internalization, but SSR inhibited signaling\n\nmore efficiently in FGFR2WT than FGFR2Y328D cells. Thus, by\n\naltering the b to a transition of the b5 strand and thereby elon-\n\ngating the a1 helix, SSR modulates inhibition of FGFR signaling\n\nand internalization.\n\nMode of Action of SSR: Binding of SSR to D3 H2\nBecause of the flexibility in D3, we performed in silico binding\n\nstudies using metadynamics, a recently developed method to\n\ndock ligands on receptors in water solution, allowing protein\n\nflexibility (Laio and Gervasio, 2008). This revealed that the free\n\nenergy of binding to the hydrophobic cavity in the H2 state\n\nwas \ufffd10.2 kcal/mol (Figure 6A), reflecting tight binding in the\nnM range. Overall, very long all-atom MD simulations and free\n\nenergy calculations with metadynamics confirmed that SSR\n\nalters the flexibility and conformational propensity of D3. The\n\nstability of the helical region in FGFR2-D3 is enhanced by an\n\ninitial step of low-affinity SSR binding, thereby making a new\n\nmetastable H2 state accessible, which is stabilized by docking\n\nof SSR (Figures 6B\u20136D and S3C). Superposing D30s structure\nin its SSR-boundH2 state with previously identified crystal struc-\n\nture of FGFR2-D2D3 showed that the FGF-interacting residues\n\nremain unaffected, in line with findings that SSR did not alter\n\nthe affinity of FGFs.\n\nIn addition, free energy calculations showed that FGFR2Y328D\n\nunderwent helix elongation and adopted the conformational\n\nstate H2, though H2 was less stable. This relates to the fact\n\nthat stabilization of the cavity is largely due to interactions of\n\nthe hydrophobic Tyr328 with the core of D3 and that these inter-\n\nactions are highly unfavorable in FGFR2-D3Y328D, in which the\n\nhydrophilic Asp328 prefers solvent exposure rather than buried\n\nconformations. Our finding that Y328D reduces but does not\n\neliminate SSR binding explains why FGFR2Y328D is still capable\n\nof binding SSR but also why its signaling is inhibited less by SSR.\n\nStructure-Activity Relationship Analysis\nExperimental and computational approaches suggest a noncon-\n\nventional allosteric regulation of FGFR function by binding of\n\nSSR to the disordered ensemble of D3. MD simulations outline\n\nthe major structural features of the H2 state and schematic\n\nfeatures of the arising binding cavity. To further probe themolec-\n\nular details of the D3-SSR interaction, we analyzed the structure\n\nactivity relationship (SAR) of a set of 19 SSR analogs by com-\n\nparing their biological activity (inhibition of phospho-ERK1/2\n\nsignaling) to their capacity to dock into the in silico-identified\n\nbinding pocket of D3 (H2 state) using the Schro\u0308dinger Glide XP\n\npackage on the nonflexible H2 state of FGFR2-D3. As shown\n\nin Table S3, two active SSR analogs inhibited ERK1/2 phosphor-\n\nylation with a comparable efficiency as SSR (IC50 \ufffd 10\u2013100 nM);\ntheir activity was reduced in FGFR2Y328D cells (Table S4), con-\n\nfirming the specificity of their activity. Six other compounds\n\nhad weak biological activity (IC50 \ufffd 100\u20131,000 nM), while\nanother tenmolecules were inactive (IC50 > 1,000 nM). One com-\n\npound could not be tested because of insolubility.

Also, to allow flexibility of\n\nprotein movements, we calculated the free binding energy (DG)\n\nof these compounds using metadynamics, which, in contrast to\n\nstandard modeling on a rigid structure, also takes into account\n\nmovements of the protein. The agreement between the calcu-\n\nlated DG and biological activity is superior to that obtained with\n\nthe Glide XP score (Table 1; Figures 7B and S4B). For instance,\n\nwhen we subtract the thermodynamic penalty of state H2\n\n(2 to 3 kcal/mol) from the calculated binding free energies, we ob-\n\ntained \ufffd8/\ufffd9 and \ufffd9/\ufffd10 kcal/mol for SSR and compound 2,\nwhich is in very close agreement with the expected value of\n\n\ufffd8.5 kcal/mol for compounds in the 100 nM affinity range. An\nagreement is also obtained for weak and inactive compounds.\n\nThe superior agreement of the free energy (calculated by Meta-\n\ndynamics) over the docking scores (calculated by Glide XP)\n\nstresses the importance of considering flexibility and explicit\n\nwater hydration.\n\nThis view is also supported by NMR measurements, in which\n\nSTD and waterLOGSY NMR were used to rank binding of this\n\nsubset of compounds (Table 1). The NMR data are in good\n\nagreement with the calculated binding energy values and bio-\nCancer Cell 23, 489\u20135\nlogical potency. Two compounds from\n\nthe active group bound the strongest,\n\nand SSR itself was the third strongest\n\nbinder, which also underscores that,\n\nbesides binding strength itself, the\n\ncompatibility with the structural allosteric\n\ntransition is also important for the effect\n\nof the compound. Again, adding large\n\ngroups at R1 induces the most profound\n\neffect (compound 17 being the weakest\n\nand compound 18 being undetectable\nby NMR due to protein precipitation). Overall, the binding\n\naffinity of SSR variants and their allosteric effect of binding\n\ngenerally correlate: the stronger a derivative binds, the more it\n\ndrives the conformation of the receptor toward the inhibited\n\nensemble.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn the accompanying paper (Bono et al., 2013), we identified\n\nSSR, a synthetic inhibitor of the FGF tyrosine kinase receptor,\n\nand provided pharmacological evidence for an allosteric mech-\n\nanism. This orally deliverable, small-molecule, multi-FGFR inhib-\n\nitor showed promising therapeutic anticancer efficacy (Bono\n\net al., 2013). SSR does not affect orthosteric FGF ligand binding,\n\ncannot penetrate the membrane, and does not directly block the\n\nTK activity but exhibits typical pharmacological allosteric fea-\n\ntures. Indeed, the compound shows signaling bias by inhibiting\n\nERK1/2 activation (relying on FGFR internalization) without alter-\n\ning phospholipase C (PLC)-g phosphorylation, has a \u2018\u2018ceiling\u2019\u2019\n\neffect, and exhibits \u2018\u2018probe dependence\u2019\u2019 (Bono et al., 2013).\n\nAll these findings suggest an allosteric conformational effect\n\nthat discriminatively affects the readout of receptor activation.\n\nIn this study, efforts were made to unravel the molecular mech-\n\nanisms of the allosteric activity of SSR. The challenge in these\n\ninvestigations is due to both the complexity of the FGFRs and\n\nthe disordered, even unfolded nature of domain D3, which is\n\nprone to aggregation, invisible to NMR, and highly flexible in\n\nthe X-ray structures in the presence of SSR.\n01, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc. 497\n\n\n\nA B C\n\nFigure 7.

The asterisk indicates p < 0.05 between the indicated conditions (dashed lines); horizontal full lines represent averages.\n\n(C) Under normal conditions, heparin sulfate-bound FGF (orange circle) binds to FGFR ECD via D2 (green) and D3 (red). While D2 is well folded, D3 is in\n\na disordered native (N, probably corresponding to amolten globule) state. The receptor can dimerize and induce distinct intracellular signaling pathways, such as\n\nreceptor internalization (leading to ERK1/2 phosphorylation) and PLC-g phosphorylation. Due to its inherent flexibility, D3 can transit to an alternative disordered\n\nstate (H1), which is more open and competent for weak SSR binding. From this state, there is a transition to a third disordered state (H2), which binds SSR\n\nstronger. In this state, SSR does not inhibit FGF binding or dimerization, but, due to altering the conformational ensemble and/or dynamics of D3, it inhibits\n\nreceptor internalization. Allostery of the system arises from SSR acting indirectly via long-range conformational effects in the disordered ensemble, attenuating\n\nmembrane interaction.\n\nSee also Figure S4 and Tables S3 and S4.\n\nCancer Cell\n\nMechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs\nAt first, it may appear surprising that a small molecule like SSR\n\nis capable of inhibiting the responses of various FGFRs to\n\nmultiple FGF ligands if steric hindrance of the orthosteric FGFR\n\npocket was the desired mode of receptor targeting. However,\n\nan allosteric interaction with a small molecule can perturb the\n\nsignaling of a large FGF ligand by inducing a conformational\n\nchange in FGFR. The model that emerges from computer simu-\n\nlations and modeling reconciles the experimental findings by\n\npredicting a marginally stable D3 fold, a weak SSR binding site\n\non D2, and a conformational change in D3 in the presence of\n\nSSR. The AGADIR software also independently predicted\n\na conformational preference of a helix over b sheet structure.\n\nThe conformational change gives rise to a new hydrophobic\n\ncavity, to which SSR can bind. A mutation that reduced the\n\na-helical propensity in this region was predicted to suppress\n\nthe SSR-induced conformational changes in silico and indeed\n\ncounteracted SSR\u2019s ability to inhibit FGFR-driven cellular\n\nprocesses.\n\nThe key element of the model is the allosteric nature of SSR\u2019s\n\naction. Whereas this molecule was selected by using the SPA\n\nassay for FGF binding and has nM pharmacological effects, it\n\ndoes not interfere with FGF binding or receptor dimerization in\n\na cellular context. Because SSR is not internalized, it acts on\n\nthe extracellular part of the receptor. Direct SSR binding to\n\nFGFR was indeed demonstrated experimentally, as was the\n\nconformational change that is critical for affecting receptor func-\n\ntion. Allostery also follows from the \u2018\u2018ceiling\u2019\u2019 effect, the differen-\n498 Cancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc.\ntial effect on distinct downstream signaling pathways, and\n\n\u2018\u2018probe dependence\u2019\u2019 (Bono et al., 2013). All these observations\n\ncan be reconciled with data from structural experiments and\n\nmodeling calculations in the followingmodel: (1) an SSR-induced\n\nconformational rearrangement of D3 is suggested by most tech-\n\nniques; (2) structural disorder of D3 is confirmed by NMR, MD\n\nsimulations, and high-crystallographic B-factors; and (3) defec-\n\ntive receptor internalization in the presence of SSR is shown in\n\ncellular assays and suggested by differential pharmacological\n\neffects.\n\nTherefore, the structural underpinning of the system is that the\n\nactual structural state of domain D3 is probably a conformational\n\nensemble corresponding to a MG state, with a global topology\n\nresembling the structure stabilized in crystallography. This\n\ndomain thus falls into the growing family of intrinsically disor-\n\ndered proteins, which lack well-defined stable folds, yet play\n\nkey regulatory and signaling roles in many cellular processes\n\n(Tompa, 2011). Its dimerization, even without a folding transition,\n\ncan be envisaged, as in fuzzy complexes (Tompa and Fuxreiter,\n\n2008) such as T-cell receptor zeta (Duchardt et al., 2007; Sigalov\n\net al., 2004). As is the case with MG states, its various conforma-\n\ntions are in an intermediate kinetic exchange regime that causes\n\nsevere line broadening in NMR, making it invisible to the NMR\n\n(Park et al., 2011).\n\nThe native ensemble of D3 samples the minor state H1, in\n\nwhich the b5 region tends to adopt local helical conforma-\n\ntions; this structural state is stabilized by weak interactions\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Local helical conforma-\n\ntions are also underlined by AGADIR predictions. Overall, this\n\ntransition is compatible with the ability of small molecules to\n\nbind to the disordered state, as observed in the inhibition of\n\nMyc-Max heterodimerization (Metallo, 2010). The SSR-FGFR\n\ninteraction is likely heterogeneous, as suggested by the failure\n\nof observing electron density for the bound SR in the crystal\n\nstructure.\n\nMD simulations suggest that, upon transition to this transient\n\nand heterogeneous complex, a hydrophobic cavity becomes\n\nexposed, in which Tyr328 plays a key role. This transient complex\n\nmay then relax into a more stable structural ensemble (H2), in\n\nwhich SSR is buried in the hydrophobic cavity (Figure S3C).\n\nThis results in amuch stronger interaction, which does not inhibit\n\nFGF binding but alters FGFR signaling, possibly due to inter-\n\nfering with membrane binding and/or internalization (Figure 7C).\n\nDisorder of this state is confirmed by increased crystallographic\n\nB-factors in the SR-complex and MD simulations and is also\n\ncompatible with the allosteric nature of regulation of the re-\n\nceptor. Transitions in the ensemble N / H1 / H2 translate\n\ninto different interactions with the membrane and/or different\n\ndynamics and orientations of receptor subunits in the dimer, re-\n\nsulting in inhibition of receptor internalization but not PLC-g\n\nphosphorylation. In all, this scenario is fully compatible with\n\nrecent concepts of allostery, which emphasize the importance\n\nof changes in dynamics without alteration of the equilibrium\n\nconformation (Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2009), and/or redistribution\n\nof the ensemble of intrinsically disordered protein structures\n\n(Hilser and Thompson, 2007). The outcome of these transitions,\n\nas seen in in cellulo assays, is an inhibition of slow and irrevers-\n\nible FGF-dependent receptor endocytosis abolishing ERK1/2\n\nphosphorylation. A similar allosteric mechanism was described\nfor the ganglioside GM3 and EGF receptor; the latter is closely\n\nrelated to FGFR (Coskun et al., 2011).\n\nThe allosteric effect was also confirmed by SAR analysis,\n\nwhich shows a good correlation of binding free energies of\n\nvarious SSR derivatives and their allosteric inhibition calculated\n\nby metadynamics modeling, while the docking scores, with their\n\nknown limitations, also have an overall correlation with biological\n\nactivity. This behavior would be fully incompatible with an\n\northosteric competitive inhibition of FGF binding and can be\n\nbest explained by a binding model in which the allosteric activity\n\nof the compound stems from its ability to induce the proper shift\n\nin the conformational ensemble of the receptor. In most cases,\n\naltering substituent R1, which faces Tyr328, impairs the allosteric\n\nactivity of the compound, which points to the importance of this\n\nresidue in the allosteric transitions.\n\nMutagenesis studies of Tyr328 are also in line with this conclu-\n\nsion, because the Tyr to Asp replacement does not basically\n\naffect the D3 structural ensemble, leaving its FGF-binding\n\ncapacity and dimerization intact. On the other hand, it reduces\n\nthe capacity of the structure to sample the local helical confor-\n\nmations, characteristic of H1 (and H2) states, thus altering SSR\n\nbinding and its ability to interfere with signaling. This is in line\n\nwith our FTIR experiments, MD simulations, and cellular assays.\n\nIn addition, this disorder-based binding and allosteric mecha-\n\nnism is also compatible with the relaxed specificity of SSR,\n\nwhich is capable of interfering with different FGFR variants in\n\ndistinct species. This would be difficult to reconcile with a well-\n\nfolded (preformed) binding cavity on D3, which would limit\n\nFGFR isoform specificity toward SSR. Adaptability of the struc-\n\ntural ensemble of intrinsically disordered proteins in binding is\n\nobserved in many cases (Dunker et al., 2008). A corollary of\n\nthis conserved allosteric regulation in all FGFR structures is\n\nthat the receptor may have endogenous regulatory compound(s)\nCancer Cell 23, 489\u2013501, April 15, 2013 \u00aa2013 Elsevier Inc. 499\n\n\n\nCancer Cell\n\nMechanism of SSR to Allosterically Block FGFRs\nthat act by a similar mechanism; identifying thesemoleculesmay\n\nopen exciting avenues of FGFR research.\n\nA final word is due on the difference of Ki values observed in\n\nthe distinct in vitro and in vivo experiments. Such an enhanced\n\nresponse to small-molecule effectors in vivo is often observed\n\n(Hanoulle et al., 2007; Huppa et al., 2010), probably due to\n\ncellular conditions, such as the presence of additional (protein)\n\nfactors or the vicinity of the membrane. The latter is probably\n\nsignaled by the preferential inhibitory effect on receptor internal-\n\nization rather than PLC-g phosphorylation. In the case of FGFR,\n\nthis effect may be augmented by the structural sensitivity of the\n\nconformational ensemble of the D3 domain.\n\nWhat are the possible implications of this study? From a\n\nstructural biology perspective, our study provides insight in\n\nfundamental mechanisms of how FGFRs transmit signals and\n\nprovides unprecedented evidence for allosteric regulation of\n\ngrowth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. We show the impor-\n\ntance of taking into account target flexibility in order to under-\n\nstand the mode of action of allosteric ligands. In addition, from\n\na biopharmaceutical perspective, our results unveil the thera-\n\npeutic potential for FGFR antagonists, perhaps wider than previ-\n\nously attributed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, since SSR blocks\n\nnot one but multiple FGFRs and because allosteric modulators\n\nare considered to have an improved benefit/risk ratio and to offer\n\nopportunities for fine-tuning biological responses in a manner\n\nthat is not attainable with classic orthosteric modulators (Chris-\n\ntopoulos, 2002). Finally, our results show that development of\n\norally deliverable selective allosteric inhibitors of growth factor\n\nreceptors is feasible, which creates formidable therapeutic\n\nopportunities for the future.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\nCompound Reconstitution\n\nSSR was stored as pure powder at 4\ufffdC in the dark.
