Its biosynthesis requires the coordinated action\nof cytoplasmic, periplasmic and membrane proteins.\nThe individual enzymatic activities of these proteins\nare well known. However, their subcellular distribu-\ntion in particular areas of the cytoplasm, periplasm, or\nwithin the membrane has never been investigated.\nWe used chromosomal replacement to generate\nP. aeruginosa strains producing fluorescent fusions\nwith PvdA, one of the initial enzymes in the biosyn-\nthetic pathway of PVDI in the cytoplasm, and PvdQ,\ninvolved in the maturation of PVDI in the periplasm.\nCellular fractionation indicated that a substantial\namount of PvdA-YFP was located in the mem-\nbrane fraction. Epifluorescence microscopy imaging\nshowed that PvdA-YFP was mainly clustered at the\nold cell pole of bacteria, indicating a polar segrega-\ntion of the protein. Epifluorescence and TIRF imaging\non cells expressing labelled PvdQ showed that this\nenzyme was uniformly distributed in the periplasm, in\ncontrast with PvdA-YFP. The description of the intra-\ncellular distribution of these enzymes contributes to\nthe understanding of the PVDI biosynthetic pathway.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIron acquisition challenges bacteria, as almost all living\norganisms, because this metal is on the one hand a\n\ncofactor of numerous redox-dependent key enzymes and\non the other hand is poorly bioavailable. As a conse-\nquence, bacteria have evolved biosynthetic pathways to\nproduce and secrete high-affinity sequestrating agents\ncalled siderophores. These molecules efficiently chelate\niron in the bacterial environment such that it can be trans-\nported back into the microorganism (Boukhalfa and Crum-\nbliss, 2002; Braun and Hantke, 2011; Hider and Kong,\n2011).\n\nThe opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium\nPseudomonas aeruginosa secretes a fluorescent sidero-\nphore called pyoverdine (PVDI) (Meyer and Abdallah,\n1978; Schalk, 2008). This chelator is composed of three\nparts: (i) a chromophore derived from 2,3-diamino-6,7-\ndihydroxyquinoline, (ii) a peptide moiety consisting of\neight amino acids bound to the carboxylic group of the\nchromophore and (iii) a dicarboxylic acid or dicarboxylic\namide attached to the C-3 of the chromophore (Demange\net al., 1990). PVDI synthesis starts in the cytoplasm with\nthe synthesis of a non-fluorescent precursor (Hannauer\net al., 2012) and ends in the periplasm (Yeterian et al.,\n2010a). The backbone of PVDI is assembled in the cyto-\nplasm and requires the coordinated activity of four large\ncytoplasmic modular enzymes known as nonribosomal\npeptide synthetases (NRPSs) \u2013 PvdL, PvdI, PvdJ and\nPvdD (Mossialos et al., 2002; Ackerley et al., 2003; Ravel\nand Cornelis, 2003) \u2013 and enzymes producing the sub-\nstrates for the four NRPSs (Visca et al., 2007). PvdA, a\nL-ornithine hydroxylase, and PvdF, a hydroxyornithine\ntransformylase, catalyse the transformation of L-ornithine\ninto L-formyl-Nd-hydroxyornithine, which is a substrate for\nthe NRPSs, PvdI and PvdJ (McMorran et al., 2001;\nMeneely et al., 2009). PvdH, an amidotransferase,\nconverts the L-aspartate b-semialdehyde into L-2,4-\ndiaminobutyrate, which is then incorporated into the\npeptide chain by PvdL (Vandenende et al., 2004). The\nPVDI synthesis starts with PvdL, which couples coen-\nzyme A to a myristic acid in an ATP-dependent reaction\nand delivers it to the L-Glu residue in the second domain\nof PvdL (Mossialos et al., 2002; Gulick and Drake, 2011).\nAfter incorporation of the first three residues \u2013 L-Glu,\nL-Tyr and L-Dab \u2013 the other amino-acid residues are\nincorporated by PvdI (for L-Ser, L-Arg, L-Ser and\nL-OHOrn), PvdJ (for L-Lys and L-OHOrn), and PvdD (for\n\nReceived 24 November, 2011; revised 9 March, 2012; accepted 10\nMarch, 2012. *For correspondence.

The presence of a\nmyristic group on the first residue (L-Glu) probably keeps\nthe PVDI precursor at the inner membrane throughout the\nbiosynthetic process (Hannauer et al., 2012).\n\nAfter formation of the PVDI backbone, which is non-\nfluorescent and has a mysristic group on the L-Glu\nresidue (Hannauer et al., 2012), the precursor is trans-\nported across the inner membrane by an export\nABC transporter PvdE (Hannauer et al., 2010) and the\nsubsequent biosynthetic steps occur in the periplasm.\nBiochemical and crystallographic studies suggested\nthat PvdQ, an N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase (Ntn-\nhydrolase), is involved in the excision of the fatty-acid\nchain (Gulick and Drake, 2011; Hannauer et al., 2012).\nThis is then followed by the cyclization of the chro-\nmophore, which yields the fluorescent PVDI. The periplas-\nmic enzymes (PvdN, PvdO and PvdP) (Ravel and\nCornelis, 2003; Lewenza et al., 2005), necessary for\nPVDI production (Ochsner et al., 2002; Lamont and\nMartin, 2003; Voulhoux et al., 2006; Yeterian et al.,\n2010a), are probably implicated in this step. Mutation of\nPvdN and PvdP abolish the secretion of fluorescent PVDI,\nindicating that these proteins must be involved in PVDI\nchromophore formation (Yeterian et al., 2010a). The efflux\npump PvdRT-OpmQ has been implicated in the delivery of\nnewly synthesized PVDI from the periplasm into the extra-\ncellular medium (Hannauer et al., 2010).\n\nThe activities of various enzymes involved in PVDI\nbiosynthesis in P. aeruginosa have been described.\nHowever, it is hard to imagine how this highly complex\nmechanism, with sequential steps in all cell compart-\nments, is orchestrated to efficiently yield a mature\ncomplex siderophore. Over the past decade, numerous\nGFP-tagged proteins have been identified at specific\nintracellular locations such as the poles of the cells, indi-\ncating that bacteria have a degree of intracellular organi-\nzation (Shapiro et al., 2009). Processes such as bacterial\ncell cycle, motility and development are now understood\nto depend upon the specific distribution of proteins within\nthe cytoplasm or within the membrane (Dworkin, 2009;\nShapiro et al., 2009; Rudner and Losick, 2010). These\nspecific cell locations are critical for bacterial cell physiol-\nogy. To further understand how these cellular locations\ninfluence PVDI biosynthesis, we generated P. aeruginosa\nmutant strains expressing, at native levels, proteins\ninvolved in this process fused with either eYFP or\nmCHERRY. We focused on PvdA, as one of the initial\nenzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of PVDI in the cyto-\nplasm, and PvdQ, as the best characterized protein\ninvolved in the maturation of PVDI in the periplasm before\nsecretion. We showed that PvdA and PvdQ, which are\ninvolved in two very distant steps in the PVDI biosynthetic\npathway, had completely different distributions within the\ncell. Whereas PvdA was mainly located at the old cell\n\npole, PvdQ was uniformly distributed throughout the\nperiplasm.\n\nResults\n\nThe PvdA C-terminal fusion is functional whereas the\nN-terminal fusion is not\n\nOur aim was to localize the PvdA enzyme in its intracel-\nlular environment, when expressed at physiological\nlevels. We constructed suicide vectors containing DNA\nencoding eYFP flanked by 700 bp upstream and down-\nstream to the insertion sites. Insertion of these modified\nregions by allelic exchange into wild-type PAO1 (Ye et al.,\n1995) produced two strains expressing eYFP fused either\nat the N-terminus (yfp-pvdA) or the C-terminus (pvdA-yfp)\nof PvdA.\n\nPVDI has a characteristic absorbance at 447 nm. We\nthus monitored bacterial growth (by measuring the optical\ndensity at 600 nm) and PVDI production (by measuring\nthe optical density at 400 nm) over time for PAO1,\nPAO1pvdA, yfp-pvdA and pvdA-yfp in iron-depleted\nminimal media (Fig. 1A). As previously reported, deletion\nof the pvdA gene did not affect bacterial growth but did\nabolish PVDI production (Visca et al., 1994; Ochsner\net al., 2002; Lamont and Martin, 2003). Concerning our\ninsertion mutants, pvdA-yfp synthesized PVDI at the\nsame level as wild-type PAO1, whereas expression of\nPVDI was not detected in yfp-pvdA. We also tested the\nability of yfp-pvdA and pvdA-yfp to transport Pvd-55Fe\ncomplexes. As expected, both of these strains transported\nPVDI-55Fe complexes as efficiently as the PAO1 and the\nPAO1pvdA deletion strains (data shown in Fig. S1A in\nSupporting information for pvdA-yfp).\n\nThe PvdA C-terminal fusion is stable whereas the\nN-terminal fusion is not expressed\n\nTo check the integrity of the PvdA fusion proteins, we\nsubjected whole-cell extracts from PAO1, PAO1pvdA, yfp-\npvdA and pvdA-yfp cultures to SDS-PAGE electrophore-\nsis followed by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP\nantibodies, which can detect all variants of Aequorea vic-\ntoria GFP. As expected, no eYFP signal was detected in\nthe PAO1 or the PAO1pvdA strains. A single band below\nthe 100 kDa marker band was detected in the cell extracts\nfrom the pvdA-yfp strain (Fig. 2A). Because wild-type\nPvdA migrates at an apparent mass of ~49 kDa (Imperi\net al., 2008), the band detected in the pvdA-yfp strain is\nconsistent with an insertion of the eYFP protein into PvdA,\nwhich would generate an ~80 kDa PvdA-eYFP fusion\nprotein. In contrast, no eYFP was detected in the cell\nextracts from the yfp-pvdA, indicating that no eYFP is\nexpressed in this N-terminal fusion strain. It is therefore\n\nPyoverdin biosynthesis at the old cell pole 1983\n\n\u00a9 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 1982\u20131994\n\n\n\nhighly likely that the PAO1pvdA phenotype of yfp-pvdA is\ndue to the absence of the fusion protein eYFP-PvdA\nrather than a defect in enzymatic activity.\n\nPvdA is a membrane-associated protein located at the\nold cell pole\n\npvdA-yfp strain was used to investigated the in vivo sub-\ncellular location of PvdA using cell fractionation. We\nanalysed each fraction, exploiting the fluorescence of\neYFP to detect the PvdA fusion protein and the fluores-\n\ncence of PVDI to assess the fractionation efficiency \u2013 as\nPVDI is located in the periplasm (Greenwald et al., 2007;\nYeterian et al., 2010a). As a control, we checked that no\neYFP was detected in the cellular compartments of a\nPAO1 strain. As shown in Fig. 2B, 82% of the total PVDI\nfluorescence was detected in the periplasm of pvdA-yfp,\nindicating a successful fractionation. In contrast, eYFP\nwas predominantly detected in the membrane fraction,\nwhich contained 60% of the total eYFP fluorescences,\ncompared with 36% of the total eYFP fluorescence con-\ntained in the cytoplasm. This is consistent with previous\n\nFig. 1. Effect of fusion proteins of eYFP with PvdA (A) and of\nmCHERRY with PvdQ (B) on bacterial growth and PVDI\nproduction. Bacteria were washed in iron-depleted succinate media\nto remove iron from LB media. Fresh minimal media were then\ninoculated with these bacteria and distributed into a 96-well plate.\nThe growth (solid lines in panels A and B) and PVDI production\n(dashed lines in panels A and B) were monitored over time by\nOD600 and OD400 measurements. Panel (A) presents the\nmeasurements for PAO1 (red), PAO1pvdA (black), yfp-pvdA (pink),\nand pvdA-yfp (blue) and panel (B) for PAO1 (red), PAO1pvdQ\n(brown), mcherry-pvdQ (green), and pvdQ-mcherry (yellow). These\nmeasurements were performed every 30 min in a Tecan microplate\nreader with shaking and incubation at 30\u00b0C. Each curve represents\na mean derived from six replicates. PVDI production (OD400) at a\ngiven time was normalized by the corresponding bacterial-growth\nreading (OD600).\n\nFig. 2. A. Immunoblot analysis of the PAO1, PAO1pvdA, yfp-pvdA\nand pvdA-yfp strains. The equivalent of 0.25 OD600 units of each\nstrain grown in succinate media were lysed in loading buffer, DNA\ndigested by benzonase (1 U), and loaded onto SDS-PAGE for\nprotein separation. Proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose\nmembrane and eYFP was detected using anti-GFP antibodies.\nMolecular weight (MW) marker bands are indicated on the left.\nB. Cell fractionation of the pvdA-yfp strain. Cell fractionation was\nperformed as described in Experimental procedures. The intensity\nof the fluorescent signal corresponding to PVDI (grey columns) and\neYFP (white columns) was measured in parallel for equal volumes\nof the cytoplasmic, periplasmic, and cell-membrane fractions. The\ndata shown represent the means of three independent\nexperiments.\n\n1984 L. Guillon et al.\n\n\u00a9 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 1982\u20131994\n\n\n\nreports that wild-type PvdA is mostly found associated\nwith membranes (Imperi et al., 2008).\n\nWe then assessed the in vivo protein location using\nepifluorescence imaging of the pvdA-yfp strain grown in\nminimal media. During the stationary phase, we found\nthat PvdA-YFP was mainly located on one pole of the\ncells. It is therefore possible that the membrane-\nassociated PvdA-YFP formed a patch on the membrane,\nwhereas we observed that the cytoplasmic fraction of\nPvdA-eYFP was uniformly distributed. We monitored the\nevolution of the cells containing a fluorescence spot over\nthe unspotted cell throughout cell growth. Although no\nspotted cells could be detected during the lag phase or at\nthe beginning of the exponential phase, we observed the\nfirst patches of fluorescence during the mid-exponential\nphase and the number of spotted PvdA-eYFP cells\nincreased until the stationary phase, when all of the cells\ndisplayed a patched pattern (Fig. 3A). Lifetime imaging\nshowed that this patch of PvdA-YFP was located at the\nold pole of the mother cell during division (Fig. 3B). As\nexpected, when PvdA-YFP was found to be uniformly\ndistributed throughout the cytoplasm, the protein\nappeared to be equally distributed to the daughter cells\n(Fig. 3C). In the presence of 10 mM PVDI-Fe, no fast\ndissolution of the PvdA-YFP spots in pvdA-yfp cells was\nobserved. The spots only started to disappear after\ncompletion of a cell cycle (Fig. 3D). In conclusion, PvdA-\nYFP was mainly located in clusters at the old cell pole,\nand exhibited a polar distribution following cell division,\nwhereas a subset of cells displayed a uniform distribution\nof the fusion protein within the cytoplasm.\n\nPvdQ N- and C-terminal fusions are fully active\n\nWe then focused on the PvdQ enzyme to gain insights\ninto the periplasmic maturation of PVDI. PvdQ belongs to\nthe superfamily of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases\n(Ntn-hydrolases). Although proteins from this family\npossess various enzymatic activities, all exhibit an auto-\nproteolytic activation resulting in the formation of two\ntightly bound chains (an a-subunit of 18 kDa that comes\nfrom the N-terminal domain of the proenzyme and a\n60 kDa b-chain) and the creation of an active site\n(Oinonen and Rouvinen, 2000; Sio et al., 2006). To deter-\nmine the subcellular location of PvdQ, we inserted DNA\nencoding mCHERRY by allelic exchange to generate\nmutant PAO1 strains expressing PvdQ with mCHERRY\nfused at either the N-terminus (mcherry-pvdQ) or the\nC-terminus (pvdQ-mcherry) of the protein. The insertion\nsite for the N-terminal fusion was placed at alanine 23,\nwhich is downstream to the cleavage site of the signal\nsequence (Sio et al., 2006). Corresponding mutator\nvectors were constructed as described for the PvdA\nmutant strains.\n\nWe monitored bacterial growth and PVDI production for\nmcherry-pvdQ, pvdQ-mcherry, PAO1 and PAO1pvdQ\nstrains, when cultured in iron-deficient succinate media\n(Fig. 1B). Every strain displayed similar growth profiles\nand only the PAO1pvdQ strain did not produce PVDI as\ndescribed previously (Ochsner et al., 2002; Lamont and\nMartin, 2003; Nadal Jimenez et al., 2010), indicating that\nmCHERRY-PvdQ and PvdQ-mCHERRY retained wild-\ntype PvdQ activity for PVDI production. As expected, the\nmcherry-pvdQ and pvdQ-mcherry mutant strains incorpo-\nrated radiolabelled PVDI-Fe complex with the same effi-\nciency as the PAO1 and PAO1pvdQ strains (Fig. S1B in\nSupporting information).\n\nPvdQ has been recently shown to play a major role in\nbiofilm formation in iron-depleted media (Wang et al.,\n2011). We tested the ability of the mcherry-pvdQ and\npvdQ-mcherry strains to form biofilm (Fig. S2 in Support-\ning information). Both strains produced about the same\namount of biofilm compared with the PAO1 strain, and\nproduced significantly more biofilm than the PAO1pvdQ\ndeletion mutant.\n\nPvdQ N- and C-terminal fusions are stable and\nmCHERRY is attached to the a- or b-subunit of\nPvdQ respectively\n\nWe tested for the presence of the PvdQ-mCHERRY\nfusion proteins by immunoblot analysis on whole-cell\nextracts derived from PAO1, PAO1pvdQ, mcherry-pvdQ\nand pvdQ-mcherry strains grown in iron-depleted minimal\nmedia. Detection was performed using antibodies raised\nagainst PvdQ (Fig. 4A) or DsRed (Fig. 4B), which recog-\nnizes the mCHERRY protein. As expected, no signal for\nanti-PvdQ antibodies was observed in the PAO1pvdQ\nstrain. In the extracts from the PAO1 strain, a single band\nof ~60 kDa was detected, which corresponds to the\nb-subunit of the PvdQ protein (Nadal Jimenez et al., 2010)\n(Fig. 4A). This same band was also observed for mcherry-\npvdQ strain. A band of ~100 kDa was detected in the\nextracts from pvdQ-mcherry, which is consistent with\nthe presence of an intact b-subunit of PvdQ fused to\nmCHERRY (Fig. 4A). Immunoblotting using anti-DsRed\nantibodies to detect mCHERRY yielded no signal in the\nextracts from PAO1 and PAO1pvdQ. However, anti-\nDsRed antibodies detected the same ~ 100 kDa band as\nthat detected by anti-PvdQ antibodies in extracts from the\npvdQ-mcherry strain, which corresponded to mCHERRY\nfused with the b-subunit of PvdQ (Fig. 4B). By comparing\nthe signals for free mCHERRY (~ 30 kDa) and the\n~ 50 kDa band detected in the mcherry-pvdQ strain, we\ndeduced that when the PvdQ protein is matured,\nmCHERRY remains fused to the a-subunit (Fig. 4B). In\nconclusion, the fully active fusion proteins that we\ndesigned are mature in a similar manner to their wild-type\n\nPyoverdin biosynthesis at the old cell pole 1985\n\n\u00a9 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 1982\u20131994\n\n\n\nFig. 3.

Very low levels of\nPVDI were detected in the cytoplasm (~ 13% of the\ntotal PVDI fluorescence), indicating that there was no\nsignificant periplasmic contamination of the cytoplasmic\nfractions (Fig. 4C and D). As expected from the PVDI-\nproduction phenotypes for mCHERRY-PvdQ and PvdQ-\nmCHERRY, most of the fluorescence for mCHERRY\n(54% of the total fluorescence for mCHERRY for both\nfusion proteins) was found in the periplasm (Fig. 4C\nand D). Nevertheless, a high level of fluorescence for\nmCHERRY (39% the total fluorescence for mCHERRY)\nwas also observed in the cytoplasmic fraction for both\n\nfusion proteins. According to the cell fractionation of\nPVDI, the presence of mCHERRY in the cytoplasmic\nfractions is not due to periplasmic contamination. We\ncompared the distribution of PvdQ in the cytoplasm and\nperiplasm of the wild-type PAO1 strain with that of our\nmutants by immunoblot analysis using an anti-PvdQ\nantibody on the isolated cell compartments (Fig. S3 in\nSupporting information). Although similar amounts of the\nPvdQ b-chain were detected in both periplasmic and\ncytoplasmic fractions, the band corresponding to the\nPvdQ a-chain was detected in the periplasmic fraction\nonly. Thus, the PvdQ enzyme in the cytoplasm may cor-\nrespond to the uncleaved inactive form of the protein,\nwhich has yet to be exported to the periplasm to com-\nplete its full maturation. Finally, the distribution of PvdQ\nin the cytoplasm and periplasm of the mcherry-pvdQ\nand pvdQ-mcherry strains, was similar to that in the\nPAO1 strain. N- and C-terminal fusion proteins of\nmCHERRY and PvdQ therefore showed the same sub-\ncellular distribution as wild-type PvdQ.\n\nThe periplasmic fluorescence distributions in mcherry-\npvdQ and pvdQ-mcherry strains were examined using\nepifluorescence microscopy. mCHERRY imaging identi-\n\nFig. 4.

We also used Total Inter-\nnal Reflection (TIRF) microscopy imaging (Fig. 5C and D),\nin which the incident light is inclined so that only the cell\nsurface is illuminated. Considering the cell-fractionation\nfindings, the full cell surface displayed in TIRF mode\nallowed us to visualize a uniform periplasmic localization\nfor both mCHERRY fusions. PvdQ, with mCHERRY fused\nto either its a- or b-subunit, is therefore uniformly distrib-\nuted throughout the periplasm.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBacteria are now understood to have a higher degree of\nintracellular organization than previously thought. Indi-\nvidual proteins are located at particular sites within the\nbacterial cell and these distribution patterns are often\ndynamic (Dworkin, 2009; Shapiro et al., 2009; Rudner\nand Losick, 2010). PVDI biosynthesis is a multistep\nprocess starting in the cytoplasm and ending in the peri-\nplasm and involving at least 11 different proteins. The\nactivities of most of these are now well characterized.\nHowever, the bacterial intracellular organization of the\nsequential steps that lead to mature PVDI and their\norchestration in vivo remain unknown.\n\nPvdA, a L-ornithine Nd-oxygenase, is one of the initial\nenzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of PVDI in the cyto-\n\nplasm (Visca et al., 1994; 2007). The N-terminal domain\nof PvdA has been recently shown to have two overlapping\nfunctional regions; an FAD-binding site and an inner\nmembrane anchoring hydrophobic domain (Imperi et al.,\n2008; Meneely et al., 2009). In a wild-type context, PvdA\nwas only fully functional and intact when eYFP was fused\nto its C-terminus. When we fused the N-terminus of PvdA\nwith eYFP, no PVDI was produced and immunoblot analy-\nsis indicated there was likely no PvdA protein present in\nthe cells. For the C-terminal fusion protein, we found a\nhigh content of eYFP in the membrane fraction after cel-\nlular fractionation of the corresponding pvdA-yfp strain,\nas previously reported for wild-type PvdA (Imperi et al.,\n2008). Epifluorescence imaging revealed that the PvdA-\nYFP fusion protein was not randomly distributed along the\ninner membrane but instead appeared as a spot at one\ncell pole. The asymmetric segregation of proteins has\nbeen previously reported to be a marker of cellular aging\nand rejuvenation in bacteria (Lindner et al., 2008).\nHowever, such process is associated with irreversible\nprotein aggregation, whereas adding PVDI-Fe to bacteria\nwith PvdA-YFP clusters to reverse PVDI biosynthesis led\nto the disappearance of clustered proteins (Fig. 3D).\nThus, the clustering of PvdA appears to be a dynamic\nprocess and must involve other functional proteins. As\nPvdA is involved in the complex sequential addition of\npeptide building blocks to form a cytoplasmic non-\nfluorescent PVDI precursor with a myristic acid chain, the\n\nFig. 5. A and B.

Guillon et al.\n\n\u00a9 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 1982\u20131994\n\n\n\nspotted localization of PvdA may reflect the need to com-\npartmentalize this coordinated process in a crowded envi-\nronment such as the cytoplasm. Indeed, the PvdA patch\nthat we observed might also contain other enzymes\nrequired for PVDI biosynthesis in the cytoplasm. The cyto-\nplasmic precursor of PVDI with a myristic acid chain\n(Gulick and Drake, 2011; Hannauer et al., 2012) would\ntherefore continually pass from one enzyme to another,\nand never be free in the cytoplasm. This organization\nwould optimize the efficiency of the process by keeping\nthe PVDI precursor close to the membrane and avoiding\nits dilution into the cytoplasm. Bacterial chemotaxis\nsignal transduction proteins are also organized as pro-\ntein assembly patches composed of transmembrane\nchemoreceptors and associated cytoplasmic proteins [for\na review, see (Sourjik, 2004)]. Using similar experimental\nmodels to those used in our study (Martin et al., 2001;\nCantwell et al., 2003; Guvener et al., 2006), immunogold\nelectron microscopy (Harrison et al., 1999), and electron\ntomography (Briegel et al., 2009), other authors have\nidentified a cluster of proteins located at the cell pole\nallowing signal transduction from the periplasm to the\ncytoplasm. As we observed with PvdA, these proteins are\nnot only present at the cell poles; a subset remains in the\ncytoplasm and the number of spotted cells increases\nduring growth (Martin et al., 2001; Cantwell et al., 2003;\nGuvener et al., 2006). PvdA promoter activity reaches a\npeak during the mid-exponential phase, after which it\ndecreases (Putignani et al., 2004). This radical change in\nPvdA promoter activity thus appears to coincide with the\nmoment we observe the switch from homogeneously dis-\ntributed proteins to the appearance of patched proteins in\ncells, and may in turn indicate how this conversion is\ngoverned. The significance of the spotted bacterial cells\nversus the unspotted cells remains unknown, but prob-\nably represents the different growing stages of individual\nbacteria.\n\nDuring cell division, we found that the clustered PvdA\ndid not relocate to both cell poles; the distribution to the\ndaughter cells was asymmetric, resulting in an old cell\npole location. Although asymmetrical division in bacteria\nremains contentious, there are an increasing number of\nexamples appearing in the literature (for a review, see\nShapiro et al., 2002). Whereas genetic information is\nequally distributed to the daughter cells, surface struc-\ntures, such as flagella or pili, are preferentially associated\nat one cell pole and are thus inherited by only one daugh-\nter cell. In the pathogenic bacteria Shigella flexneri and\nListeria monocytogenes, the old cell poles accumulate\nproteins that promote interactions with the host (Goldberg\net al., 1993; Smith et al., 1995).\n\nFinally, addition of 10 mM PVDI-Fe to pvdA-yfp cells did\nnot result in rapid dissolution of the PvdA-YFP spot; they\nonly started to disappear after a cell-division cycle. This\n\nsuggests that PVDI-Fe does not regulate the organization\nof PvdA into spots.\n\nPvdQ is a well-characterized Ntn-hydrolase that\nremoves the myristic chain linked to the precursor PVDI\nbefore secretion (Lamont and Martin, 2003; Bokhove\net al., 2010; Nadal Jimenez et al., 2010; Gulick and\nDrake, 2011). When transferred into PAO1 strains, the\nN-terminal and C-terminal fusion proteins of PvdQ exhib-\nited the full enzymatic activity of PvdQ and produced\nPVDI at wild-type levels. In contrast with the spotted loca-\ntion of PvdA, PvdQ was uniformly distributed throughout\nthe periplasm. Fluorescent PVDI having no more myristic\nchain is also detected all over the periplasm by epifluo-\nrescence microscopy (Yeterian et al., 2010a). Mutation of\nthe efflux pump PvdRT-OpmQ involved in PVDI secretion\nacross the outer membrane, increases PVDI accumula-\ntion in the bacterial periplasm (Hannauer et al., 2010).\nTogether all these data suggest a maturation of PVDI\nhomogeneously distributed throughout the periplasm.\n\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that the PVDI cyto-\nplasmic precursor is synthesized through coordinated\nenzymatic activities localized at the interface between\nthe cytoplasm and the inner membrane of the bacterial\nold cell pole. This specific cellular localization probably\nensures the efficiency of this complex biosynthesis.\nPvdQ, an enzyme involved in the periplasmic maturation\nof PVDI, is homogeneously distributed throughout the\nperiplasm like fluorescent PVDI having no more myristic\nchain (Yeterian et al., 2010a). This homogeneous distri-\nbution of PVDI maturation all over the bacterial periplasm\nprobably ensures a secretion of the siderophore across\nthe outer membrane all over the bacterial periphery.\nFurther studies are required to confirm this model and to\nidentify the cell localization of the other enzymes involved\nin this process.\n\nExperimental procedures\n\nBacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions\n\nThe P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli strains and the plas-\nmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were\nusually grown in Luria broth [(LB); Difco] medium kept at\n37\u00b0C. The P. aeruginosa strains were grown overnight at\n30\u00b0C in an iron-deficient succinate medium (composition:\n6 g l-1 K2HPO4, 3 g l-1 KH2PO4, 1 g l-1 [NH4]2SO4, 0.2 g l-1\n\nMgSO4 7H2O and 4 g l-1 sodium succinate with the pH\nadjusted to 7.0 by adding NaOH). The antibiotic, gentamicin\n(50 mg ml-1), was added as required.\n\nMutant construction\n\nAll enzymes for DNA manipulation were purchased from Fer-\nmentas and were used in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions.

PCR, using iProof polymerase\n(Bio-Rad), was used to amplify the genes encoding the fluo-\nrescent proteins from the following cDNAs: pCDNA3.1/\nmCHERRY for mCHERRY and pCDNA3.1/eYFP for eYFP.\nThe DNA fragments from Pseudomonas used for cloning\nwere amplified from the PAO1 genomic DNA. Primers used\nare listed in Table S1 of Supporting information. The general\nprocedure consisted of cloning the pME3088 suicide vector\n(Voisard et al., 1994) into a construct composed of the fluo-\nrescent protein encoding DNA flanked by upstream and\ndownstream regions of 700 bp relative to the insertion site.\nMutations in the chromosomal genome of P. aeruginosa\nwere generated by transferring the suicide vectors from\nE. coli S17-1 into the PAO1 strains and integration of the\nplasmids into the chromosome, with selection for tetracycline\nresistance. A second crossing-over event excising the vector\nwas achieved by enrichment for tetracycline-sensitive cells to\ngenerate the corresponding mutants (Ye et al., 1995). All\ngene-replacement mutants were verified by PCR.\n\nPvdA labelled at the N-terminus with eYFP (YFP-PvdA)\nwas derived through three sets of PCRs. The 700 bp region\nupstream to the PvdA gene, which contains the ATG start\ncodon, was amplified by the primers PvdA1 and PvdA2,\nwhich inserted restriction sites for EcoRI and XbaI respec-\ntively. The 700 bp downstream region was amplified by the\nprimers PvdA3 and PvdA4, which inserted restriction sites\nfor XhoI and HindIII respectively. The DNA encoding eYFP\nwas amplified by the primers YFP1 and YFP2, which\ninserted restriction sites for XbaI and XhoI respectively. Fol-\nlowing PCR, the amplified 700 bp upstream region was\ndigested by XbaI, the amplified 700 bp downstream region\nwas digested by XhoI, and the amplified DNA encoding\neYFP was digested by XbaI and XhoI. After their digestion,\nall three of these PCR products were ligated in equimolar\namounts. The ligation product was used as a DNA template\nfor further amplification with the primers PvdA1 and PvdA4.\nThe PCR product was digested by EcoRI and HindIII,\n\nligated into pME3088, linearized by the same enzymes, to\nproduce pMEM1.\n\nPvdA labelled at the C-terminus with eYFP (PvdA-YFP)\nwas also derived from three sets of PCRs. The 700 bp\nregion upstream relative to the stop codon was amplified by\nthe primers and PvdA6, which inserted restriction sites for\nEcoRI and XbaI. The 700 bp downstream region containing\nthe stop codon was amplified with primers PvdA7 and\nPvdA8, which inserted restriction sites for XhoI and HindIII\nrespectively. The eYFP-encoding DNA was amplified with\nthe primers YFP1 and YFP2, which inserted restriction sites\nfor XbaI and XhoI respectively. Following PCR, the amplified\n700 bp upstream region was digested by XbaI, the amplified\n700 bp downstream region was digested by XhoI, and the\namplified DNA encoding eYFP was digested by XbaI and\nXhoI respectively. After their digestion, all three of these\nPCR products were ligated in equimolar amounts. The liga-\ntion product was used as a template for amplification by\nprimers PvdA5 and PvdA8, and the resulting PCR product\nwas digested by EcoRI and HindIII, cloned into pME3088,\nlinearized by the same enzymes to produce pMEM2.\n\nPvdQ labelled at the N-terminus with mCHERRY\n(mCHERRY-PvdQ) was derived from three sets of PCRs. The\n700 bp upstream region containing the predicted protease I\ncleavage site (amino acid A23) was amplified with the primers\nPvdQ1, which inserting a restriction site for EcoRI, and\nPvdQ2, which inserted a restriction site for XbaI.

Cells\nwere pelleted and washed once with one volume of succinate\nmedia and then resuspended to reach a final concentration of\n0.1 OD600 ml-1. Two hundred microlitres of the suspension\nwere distributed into 96 well plates (Greiner, PS-microplate\nflat bottom). Plates were then incubated at 30\u00b0C and agitated\nin a Tecan microplate reader (Infinite M200, Tecan) for mea-\nsurements of OD600 and OD400 every 30 min over 35 h. Each\nmeasurement represented a mean taken from six replicates.\n\nIron uptake assays\n\nPVDI-55Fe (0.25 Ci mmol-1) was prepared as previously\ndescribed (Schalk et al., 2001), with a fourfold excess of\nPVDI over iron. The uptake assays were carried out as\ndescribed previously (Schalk et al., 2001). An overnight\nculture in iron-limited medium was harvested and the bacteria\nprepared at an OD600 of 1 in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and\nincubated at 37\u00b0C. Transport assays were initiated by adding\n100 nM of PVDI-55Fe. Aliquots (100 ml) of the suspension\nwere removed at different times, filtered, washed with 3 ml\n\n50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and the retained radioactivity was\ncounted. The experiment was repeated with cells that had\npreviously been treated with 200 mM carbonyl cyanide\nm-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a protonophore that\ninhibits iron uptake (Cl\u00e9ment et al., 2004).\n\nBiofilm quantification (Siroy et al., 2006)\n\nCells were cultured in LB media overnight at 37\u00b0C. Cells were\npelleted and washed once with one volume of succinate\nmedia and were then resuspended to a final concentration of\n0.05 OD600 ml-1. Three millilitres of the suspension were dis-\ntributed in triplicate into a six-well plate (Greiner, TC-plate\nCELLSTAR). Plates were then incubated at 30\u00b0C over 24 h\non a rocker shaker. For crystal-violet treatment, culture\nsupernatants were carefully removed, and the biofilm was\nwashed twice with sterile water. One millilitre of 0.5% crystal\nviolet was added and left in contact for 15 min at room tem-\nperature with gentle agitation. After removal of the solution,\nthe biofilm was washed twice with sterile water before elution\nof crystal violet by 1 ml of ethanol. The biofilm was then\nquantified by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm of either\nthe directly eluted crystal violet or of an appropriate dilution\nfor accurate quantification.\n\nImmunoblot analysis\n\nWe subjected 0.25 OD600 units of cells grown in succinate\nmedia to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocel-\nlulose membranes by electroblotting (Bio-Rad). The nitrocel-\nlulose membranes were then blocked by incubation for 1 h in\nblocking solution [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.6,\n10% dried milk powder] followed by incubation in blocking\nbuffer supplemented with primary anti-PvdQ antibodies\n(1:1000 dilution), anti-GFP antibodies (1:10 000 dilution), or\nanti-DsRed antibodies (1:100 dilution, Ozyme). Membranes\nwere then incubated in PBS (pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween) supple-\nmented with a secondary antibody of IRDye 800CW donkey\nanti-rabbit IgG (1:10 000 dilution, Clinisciences). Antibody\nbinding was detected with an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR\nBiosciences).\n\nCell fractionation\n\nPeriplasm and cytoplasm fractions were prepared as previ-\nously described (Nader et al., 2011). Fifty millilitres of bacte-\nrial cultures grown overnight in succinate medium were\ncentrifuged to obtain a cell pellet, which was washed twice\nwith 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and then resuspended in 1.5 ml\nof buffer A (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% sucrose). Sphero-\nplasts were obtained by adding 15 ml of 100 mg ml-1\nlysozyme (Euromedex) to the suspension and shaking the\nmixture gently at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. The suspension was then cen-\ntrifuged (15 min at 6700 g) to obtain the spheroplast pellet\nand the periplasmic fraction (the supernatant). Spheroplast\npellets were washed with 500 ml of buffer A, and resuspended\nin 1.5 ml of cold water by vortexing; the resulting suspension\nwas incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with benzonase (1 ml of a\n50-fold dilution of benzonase \ufffd 250 units ml-1 from Sigma).\nThe cytoplasmic fractions were isolated by ultracentrifugation\n\nPyoverdin biosynthesis at the old cell pole 1991\n\n\u00a9 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 14, 1982\u20131994\n\n\n\n(40 min at 120 000 g). Pellets were resuspended in about\n1.5 ml of buffer A. Two hundred microlitres of each fraction\nwere distributed into a 96-well plate and the fluorescence was\nmeasured in a Tecan microplate reader (Infinite M200, Tecan)\nusing the following excitation/emission wavelengths: 400 nm/\n450 nm for PVDI, 514 nm/527 nm for eYFP, and 570 nm/\n610 nm for mCHERRY.\n\nFluorescence microscopy imaging\n\nSamples were prepared from strains cultured overnight in\nsuccinate media. Cultures were washed by succinate media\nand appropriately diluted in the same media. Five microlitres\nof cell suspension were spotted on a glass slide that was\nfreshly coated with 1% agarose made in minimal media, and\ncovered with a coverslip. TIRF images were acquired with an\nObserver.A1 (Zeiss) equipped with a Plan Fluar objective\n(NA: 1.45, Zeiss) and a Cascade II 512 EMCCD camera\n(photometrics). The imaging system was operated using\nthe software, VisiView 1.7.4 (Visitron Systems GmbH).\nmCHERRY was excited by exposure to a laser of 561 nm\nwavelength with a visitron VisiTIRF system. Fluorescence\nsignals were aquired using an appropriate filter cube. To\ndetermine the pole location of the patched pvdA-yfp during\nbacterial growth, cell division of the strain \u2013 grown twice in\nsuccinate media during the exponential phase \u2013 was moni-\ntored. Cells were spotted onto slides coated with agarose,\nwhich was dissolved in succinate media. Cells were imaged\nafter 0, 1 and 2 h incubation periods at 30\u00b0C with a Nikon 50i\n(objective: CFI Achroplan 100 \u00a5 A ON 1.25 DT 0.18) micro-\nscope equipped with a numeric 12 bits DS-Fi1 camera. For\nfluorescence imaging of eYFP, the filter GFP-3035B (excita-\ntion 472 \ufffd 32 nm, emission 520 \ufffd 35 nm, dichroic filter 502\u2013\n730 nm) was used. Images were captured using the imaging\nsoftware, NIS elements. Images were minimally processed\nwith Image-JNIH software (Abramoff et al., 2004).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was partly funded by the Centre National de la\nRecherche Scientifique, by grants from the Centre Interna-\ntional de Recherche au Fronti\u00e8re de la Chimie (FRC), from\nthe ANR (Agence Nationale de Recherche, ANR-08-BLAN-\n0315-01), as well as from the Deutsche Forschungsgemein-\nschaft (FOR 929 and SFB 746).
